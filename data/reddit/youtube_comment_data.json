Calling soldiers of a Nazi war effort Nazi soldiers was a mistake, for sure, but a more complicated mistake than such analogies. As a personal note, I will say that I have close family members in Germany, and I feel that the transformation of the country after the war is a beautiful and inspiring story that we often take for granted.

To believe they were more altruistic than the elite movers and shakers in today's privileged class is wishful thinking. The progression has followed an expected course, the privileged have increased their grip and broadened the boundaries of their control. The current trend implies that it will likely get worse before it' gets better for marginalized middle and lower class Americans. I think Bernie is right, it will take a revolution to change the present course. The privileged are not going to volunteer to participate in a major paradigm shift of their value and belief system whose foundation  is \"every man for himself\". Today's American ruling class resembles the bigger and stronger men pushing women and children out of the way to get to the life boats first on the Titanic. It's Darwinian evolution; \"survival of the fittest\" to the point of dominance and blind to the suffering it causes the less powerful. With distinction between the powerful and powerless comes an arrogance and sense of entitlement clearly demonstrated by Lloyd Blankfein's statement and belief that he and his ilk were \"doing God's work\" when they were guilty of crashing the world's economy for their own gains. And gain they did!  I propose that the powerful more closely resemble and present the behavioral characteristics of Sociopaths and Psychopaths rather than self proclaimed agents of a benevolent higher power.

We are taught that drs are very knowledgeable, and we should listen and take their advice.  Back when this was first 'discovered', I believe everybody wanted to get on the bandwagon, if you were a dr, and didn't have a patient with DID, you weren't part of the action, thus the numbers of patients with DID skyrocketed.\n\nListening to the dr, who was also a patient with DID, I was appalled when she said that if a patient denied they had DID, it meant that they DEFINITELY had it.  It was like she was saying this is it, you've got it whether you do or not.  Sort of damned if you do, damned if you don't, her mind's made up, that's that.  That strikes me as closed minded, and that's the last thing a dr should be.\n\nI think as people we are all multi-faceted.  We have many aspects to our personalities.  I know sometimes I'm withdrawn, and want nothing more than to stay home with a good book, other times I want to go out and socialize, and party.  Then there's the work mode aspect, the parent, and so forth.  These aren't different 'personalities', but just a facet of me, the mood I happen to be in at the time.  I think sometimes we search for things that aren't there, and if you search long enough, you're bound to find something, real or imagined.", "likes": 7}, {"id": "qVMLr0IHSsc", "text": "This Jimmy guy seems like an arrogant con artist ....

Mike was in country 67-68 during Tet.They all have that same slow way of talking, measuring each word.  He was not the brother that I said goodbye to a year before. When Mike came back he had a room in our basement in Michigan. One morning dad came into his room and gave him a shake to wake him up..... no one knew Mike had a .45 under his pillow. He almost shot my dad. Michael threw himself into religion, he would have been one of these guys in the woods otherwise. It could have easily happened. Mike too kept his medals not in a shoe box, but in a cigar box. He never talked about them. Just said it was for playing boy scout. Michael suffered terribly from Agent Orange and was finally released from his pain in 2012. The VA just waited for those guys to die so they didn't have to pay,  and they got their wish.

Some things to note.\n\n1.)This film is about a group of friends doing something that they have NO IDEA what they are doing.  It\u2019s a story about the friendship, group dynamics and struggles that ensue. Not a how-to or history lesson on train hopping. I would have filmed on a go pro, gone with or interviewed experienced hoppers and been more low key. But some people don\u2019t consider we are each walking around with a large DSLR camera ( myself being a black magic 4K camera) which is a little less than low key. Lol \ud83d\ude02\n\n2.)  This was filmed over 3 years ago, so a lot of people\u2019s pre conceived notions (especially socio-political ones) about those in the film should be taken with a grain of salt. Times were different, even just with the little time that has passed. \n\n3.) The film portrays and highlights  a lot of group drama because quite frankly, it is what makes a story interesting. Contrary to what you may think, 80 percent of the trip was a great laid back time \ud83d\ude04\ud83e\udd19.\n\n4.) Duh, if I wanted to make it across the US way easier if I would have done it by myself. But that wouldn\u2019t be as fun or interesting, and pushing the limits of the experience is the whole point ( to run into conflict, problems etc.) most people don\u2019t realize but from where we started in Southern California  to where we got caught was over 1700 miles away. There are much quicker (and easier) ways to get across America Via train. But we took the high line because we are a shooting a documentary and wanted to experience and film the most scenic and beautiful parts of America. If we would have put that into eastbound miles as apposed to northbound ( the direction we took ) we would have been nearly 3/4ths the way there. So all considering I think it\u2019s amazing we even got as far as we did considering our footprint. Anyways, I wouldn\u2019t have done it any other way\ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffc\u200d\u2642\ufe0f\ud83d\ude00.\n\nI feel like this will answer most questions or comments that have been left.

Like you, I find sad the way Ken has been treated by the critics. His cinema was revolutionary and part of the counter-culture of the 1960s-1970s. And it definitely influenced many figures like Stanley Kubrick in Clockwork Orange as its use of symbolism and violent imagery owes a lot to what Ken did. And a movie like The Devils is as crucial as Carl Theodor Dreyer's The Passion of Joan of Arc. A shame that people at Warners don't take the time to release that film in its uncut version. Other movies from Ken that I love is Crimes of Passion with Kathleen Turner, Whore with Theresa Russell, Natasha Richardson's Gothic (her first film as Lisi Tribble Russell told me on Twitter) and Joely Richardson's Lady Chatterley. Those movies have lots of imaginative visuals and pretty great scripts. Thank you for this great analysis on this director I love. The more people make videos about him on Youtube, make reviews on culture blogs/twitter/Amazon; the more humanity and Cinema culture will remember the importance of his films. To me, Word of Mouth is the ultimate publicity for an artist and the best way to anger detractors.", "likes": 4}, {"id": "5NDVPX_mEJ0", "text": "only losers are held accounted for.", "likes": 0}, {"id": "GpYGMIZ9Bow", "text": "Future.

There are a few divergences. For example, the 2007 documentary claims that the fire was extinguished by turning off the fans, while this earlier documentary states that water put it out. Other inconsistencies include the fact that the 2007 documentary hardly mentions the pollution that had occurred prior to the accident; and nor does it mention the damage to Cockcroft's filters and their ineffectiveness at preventing contamination escaping. I find it remarkable that two documentaries on the same subject can have such great differences! I believe more in  this 1990 documentary for the simple reason that today there is no real reporting, It's either sensationalised to garner views or tapered to suit a particular interest. Back in the 1980s when this documentary was being put together, the BBC was an organisation that could be trusted to be very objective and unbiased in its reporting of these types of events.
