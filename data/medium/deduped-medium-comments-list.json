You are mingling with a glass of wine, bumping into random people, small-talking for 3 minutes, and moving to the next person with whom you\u2019ve just made an eye contact. A Brownian motion of human beings who spend an hour exchanging business cards.\nYou\u2019ve paid a thousand dollars for this event, so you want to squeeze value from every hour. A reception is the time for networking, and you are trying to collect as many contacts as you possibly can. Sometimes, you run into a potential customer or an investor. Sometimes, you meet companies whose products you would like to try. But 90% of the time, you end up talking to total strangers, whom you will never see again in your entire life.\nLet\u2019s look at it pragmatically. Is it a waste of time?\nNo! It definitely is not. Besides widening your network, it helps you polish your elevator pitch.\nIn the middle of each small-talk, you get asked \u201cwhat do you do?\u201d, and you respond with your pitch. You always get feedback. Sometimes, you may see a new relationship developing with a potential customer or investor; more often, you may hear a short comment or a piece of advice; even more often, it\u2019s just a second-long facial expression. Your brain registers the feedback and calibrates. A few minutes later you will be pitching to another person, and you will do it differently. Maybe you will adjust your intonation. Maybe you will change a few words, or maybe even completely refurbish the entire message. You learn how people react to your elevator pitch, and you make it better.\nIf you are in Silicon Valley, there are small events for startups every day. Each of them can give you two dozen feedbacks, so you will make two dozen calibrations. If you attend meetups every night, you can get a few hundred feedbacks/calibrations a month. On the other hand, a large event like TechCrunch Disrupt can provide the same number within a couple of days.\nSuch calibrations not only help you improve the wording of the pitch, but, more importantly, embolden you to adjust the business idea behind your startup. You tailor your vision based on the feedback you receive.\nIn a few months, you realize that you completely reworked your pitch. People are now responding and engaging way better; you are getting follow up emails more often. You improved both your idea and the way you communicate it.\nBut do you really have to visit a hundred meetups in order to make your pitch better? No. There is a way to polish it faster and more efficiently. It\u2019s a team exercise called \u201cThe Pitch Evolution Game\u201d. During the game, each participant experiments with improving their individual pitch, and the team as a whole selects one winner. I\u2019ll explain to you how it works in a few minutes. But first, some background.\nI am a Microsoft/Intel alum turned entrepreneur (3 startups, 1 exit).\nFor the last 10 years, besides running my companies, I have been occasionally conducting workshops for international entrepreneurs, teaching them how to launch a global startup. Originally, I created the Pitch Evolution Game to help my students practice pitching, and also as a tool for them to select an idea for an imaginary startup, which they were required to design during a workshop. Over time, my former students and I have started using \u2018the Game\u2019 for a wide spectrum of scenarios:\nSince you\u2019re reading about the game as opposed to actually playing it, the rules may seem a little abstract to you. But one first-hand experience will make you realize how engaging it actually is.\nThe game requires a group of participants (12\u201336 persons) and a moderator who runs the game. Normally, it lasts for 1\u20132 hours.\nEvery participant must come prepared with their own elevator pitch. The pitch will be voiced several times through the duration of the game. The players are allowed to change their pitch every single time they have to declare it.\nThe game participants sit in a circle, and the moderator stands in the center. The moderator starts with a random pair of players sitting next to each other. Both participants in the pair will then declare their pitches one after the other, and the remaining players will vote for the better pitch.\nAs a result of this iteration we will have selected a winning pitch in the pair and the winner will be sitting in the most clockwise chair in the pair.\nNow, the moderator picks the next pair. However, it\u2019s not a random selection this time. It is the winner from the previous step, plus a new person, sitting next to the winner clockwise. Both pair members declare their pitches, and the above-described iteration repeats for the new pair.\nThe process thereafter continues in a loop for the subsequent pairs of players.\nEssentially, we have a bubble-sort of pitches. The best pitch in a pair is selected by way of voting. The author of the best pitch in a pair moves clockwise. The process continues in a loop. It will go through the entire circle of participants several times. As a result, each player will have at least a few opportunities to practice their pitch and experiment with it. Some participants, the authors of popular pitches, will enjoy long and uninterrupted series of winning chair-swaps, until their movement (via the circle) gets stopped by someone who comes with an even better pitch.\nIn its basic version, the game ends when the ultimate winner is selected: it\u2019s a person who gets an uninterrupted sequence of chair swaps through the entire circle.\nThere are variations of the game rules as well, which allow for selecting a few winners as opposed to just one. The moderator also has the power to adjust the rules depending on the goals of the exercise, circumstances, or even team dynamics.\nMeanwhile there are (rare) cases when the players become overexcited and a few of them might seem to lose the ability to control their laughter, or there could be scenarios when they get physically and emotionally drained. Every game is unique. It is the moderator\u2019s job to control the situation as the game proceeds and improvise, if necessary. In most cases, however, the game is easy to manage.\nA few additional recommendations:\nThe Pitch Evolution Game is a fun and engaging two-hour team exercise. For a team as a whole, it\u2019s a powerful tool to select and/or polish a business idea. For individual participants, it is a great way to practice and improve their pitching skills.\nYou can run the game yourself; it\u2019s easy and fun to be a moderator. You can organize it for free, and there is no need to pay any licensing fee for using the game; but please, do send me a short email sharing your experience after the event.\nAlternatively, contact me if you want to invite me to moderate the game for you.\nGood luck and let the venture force be with you!\nP.S. Over the last few years, I\u2019ve created a one-day lab for startups that need to pivot. The Pitch Evolution Game is the core of this lab, but there is a lot more besides the game. Come back in a couple of weeks, I will explain all important details about the pivot lab in one of my next posts.\n", "claps": "1.1K claps", "author": "Vlad Pavlov", "comments": [], "link": "https://medium.com/sv4ie/the-pitch-evolution-game-719098c6f9b6"}, {"title": "This iPhone Feature will Improve Your Relationships (and the Rest of Your Life)", "num_comments": 4, "tags": ["tech", "life", "productivity", "startup", "self improvement"], "reading_time": 14, "text": "Recently, I read a book about a man named Matthew Cowley, who was an incredible missionary and humanitarian to the people in New Zealand over 100 years ago.\nThe book detailed the man\u2019s life and one thing really stood out to me. Throughout Cowley\u2019s life, he was regarded by thousands of people to be a truly good friend.\nThis subject spoke to me because \u201cfriendship\u201d is becoming an increasingly complex and confusing topic.\nWhat does it mean to be a good friend?\nWhat does being a good friend look like in a world of constant connection?\nCowley lived long before the internet. But he did a few things that are extremely relevant that I think all of us could do today. Moreover, with new technologies, we can actually make our friendships even more intimate than ever.\nThe two things Cowley did well were:\nIn this article, I\u2019m going to briefly share how to radically enhance your memory, since remembering key details is essential to becoming a good friend.\nI\u2019m also going to explain why the iPhone audio-text message feature is potentially one of the most powerful tools for developing deep and meaningful friendships. When you become a good friend, you will change people\u2019s lives. You\u2019ll pull people out of slumps you didn\u2019t even know they were in. You\u2019ll be an answer to their prayers. You\u2019ll give them strength in times of need. You\u2019ll cheer them up and allow them to appreciate the small things in life. You\u2019ll trigger memories they\u2019ve long since forgotten.\nBy the end of this article, you will understand:\nI\u2019ve recently written a post about how to enhance your memory. Without question, most people fail to utilize their long-term memory. There is no limit to the storage of memories we can have. Our subconscious has infinite bandwidth.\nMost people\u2019s problem is that they lack powerful strategies for enhancing memory. Here\u2019s a simple breakdown:\nI recently met a person named Jacob, which was easy because I have a brother named Jacob. I tried to be mindful about how this new Jacob may remind me of my brother \u2014 even if in a seemingly ridiculous way. It doesn\u2019t matter how ridiculous the connection is. In fact, the more imaginative the better. And the more connections you make, the deeper the memory will be forged.\nPut simply, you can remember nearly every person\u2019s name you meet if you actually give attention and care. Ask a few questions about the person when you meet them and while you\u2019re actively listening, make imaginative connections that trigger a deep memory.\nI\u2019m confident I won\u2019t forget that kid, Jacob\u2019s name. I know that my memory is infinite and powerful. I know that your memory is infinite and powerful.\nIn order to be a good friend, you need to remember people. Firstly, you need to remember their name, but you also need to remember key details about them. Once you get good at using your memory, you can remember lots and lots of details in a short amount of time.\nWhich brings me to writing letters. And really, which brings me to the iPhone. This is an article about an iPhone feature after all.\nHand-written letters are indeed important. In a world of digital and surface-level communication, it is very powerful to involve some personal touch.\nHowever, I recently became aware of the audio-text message feature on my iPhone. And after reading about Matthew Cowley, I decided to start sending \u201caudio letters\u201d to my friends and family.\nWhile writing in my journal one night, several people started popping into my head. When someone would pop into my mind, I\u2019d pull out my phone and send them an audio-text message.\nSometimes, the people who came to my mind were old friends from high school I hadn\u2019t talked to in years. I reached out to mentors. I reached out to a cousin I hadn\u2019t talked to in a long time, which relationship has become quite strained over the years.\nIn my audio texts, I expressed genuine love and appreciation. I thanked them for specific experiences we had had together and told them how meaningful those experiences were to me. I brought humor and fun into the messages when it made sense.\nThe replies I got to these audio messages were unexpected and sometimes unbelievable.\nMore than once, I had someone reach back and told me they were in tears. I had one person tell me I had \u201cfollowed the spirit\u201d and that I reached out at just the right time and said exactly what he needed to hear. Crazy, right?\nI rekindled old ties that had long since faded away.\nThere\u2019s a lot of really cool science behind what I\u2019m currently describing. I\u2019ll start with gratitude:\nYou actually see and treat people differently after you\u2019ve expressed gratitude to them. This fits with two really great quotes that I love:\nThus, when you see someone or something different, you treat that thing or person differently. When you treat them differently, they change.\nBut not only do they change, but you also change. Which brings me to how motivation and identity work:\nWhen you act kind, you perceive yourself to be kind. When you wake up early and start your day right, you see yourself as someone who is motivated. Put simply, your behavior shapes your identity. Your behavior also shapes your beliefs.\nWhen you change your identity, your personality begins transforming as well. According to Dr. Maxwell Maltz in his powerful book, Psycho-Cybernetics, \u201cThe \u2018self-image\u2019 is the key to human personality and human behavior. Change the self-image and you change the personality and the behavior.\u201d\nHow do you change the identity? You change the behavior. Then, as your behavior changes, your identity changes. Desire comes first, then decision, then action, then identity, then personality. Once your personality changes, you own it. It\u2019s now a part of you.\nSo how do you become a good friend?\nYou start acting like a good friend. And a very simple and powerful way to do this is by sending audio-texts to your friends and to anybody really. You could send texts to seriously anyone whose phone number you have and express appreciation. The more specific the appreciation, the more memorable. The more you connect that appreciation to relevant things, the more memorable it will be to the other person. Thus, not only can you rekindle friendships, you can create new ones.\nThis will, of course, change the people you are talking to (especially if they really need some love). It will also transform the relationship. And indeed, it will transform you.\nYour behavior will change how you see yourself. When you start acting like a better friend, you\u2019ll see yourself as more friendly. Your gratitude will change you. It will increase your self-esteem.\nBut not only that, your behavior will increase your motivation. Which brings me to another strand of science.\nHere\u2019s what most people have wrong about motivation. They believe motivation leads to action. This is the opposite of the truth. Action creates motivation. As the famous entrepreneurial coach, Dan Sullivan has said, \u201cGood things only happen when you are in motion.\u201d\nThus, when you start sending greater love to your friends, you\u2019ll feel even more motivated to be a better friend and person. Similar to motivation is inspiration. How do you get inspired? You act. You wake up early and start exercising, even if initially you don\u2019t want to.\nHow you feel in the moment doesn\u2019t really matter. What does matter are the feelings you\u2019ll have as a result. Again, your behavior shapes your identity, beliefs, and motivation.\nYou can make doing the right thing become automatic once you become accustomed to the results that come by doing the right thing. As you act powerfully, you\u2019ll develop confidence. When dispels yet another myth people have about success.\nIt\u2019s not confidence that creates success \u2014 it\u2019s successful behavior that creates confidence. So, when you do what you tell yourself you\u2019re going to do and start getting small wins, you\u2019ll develop more confidence.\nHere\u2019s a powerful principle to live by: Do what is right let the consequence follow.\nThis is how confidence forms.\nAnd why do amazing things, like wake up early, exercise, practice personal development, and become a better friend?\nBecause you deserve it. And because you love yourself. You are worth investing in.\nYou are worth waking up early for.\nYou\u2019re worth becoming a successful person.\nYou\u2019re worth becoming incredibly happy and healthy.\nYou\u2019re worth living a life you're proud of.\nYou should make powerful decisions because you love yourself. That\u2019s why I wake up at 5AM because I love myself. I\u2019m worth having a good day. I\u2019m worth being motivated, inspired and powerful.\nSo are you.\nAnd you demonstrate that self-worth through powerful choices. You can make those choices today. In fact, you must start making them now. As Meredith Willson said, \u201cYou pile up enough tomorrows, and you\u2019ll find you are left with nothing but a lot of empty yesterdays.\u201d\nJoe Polish is one of the most connected people in business. He has a strategy for enhancing connections. He calls it his \u201cMagic Rapport Formula.\u201d The principles of his formula are:\nSo many of these principles are life-changing. If you apply these concepts, you will become an incredible friend. You\u2019ll build a world-class network. You\u2019ll become extremely successful in life and business. To quote Zig Ziglar, \u201cYou can have everything in life you want, if you will just help other people get what they want.\u201d\nHere\u2019s why iPhone audio-texting is so powerful. It allows you to be \u201cas close to in-person\u201d as you can. Of course, you can send a video text if you\u2019d like. However, audio is powerful because a person can listen to your words, in your voice, and be able to reflect. Sometimes a video can look a little strange (not that you shouldn\u2019t do it).\nThere is a key concept in psychology known as \u201copenness to experience.\u201d In fact, it is one of the \u201cBIG 5\u201d factors of personality. Sadly, as most people age, they become increasingly less open to having new experiences. Most people progressively stop seeking friendships with new types of people and avoid taking on new challenges and risks. They stop seeking new information that conflicts with their current perspectives and way of life. Hence, it is common for people to becoming increasingly \u201cset in their ways\u201d as they age.\nExperiences can and should change you. Yet, many people go through life experiences completely shut-off to what their experiences could teach them.\nIf you learn from the experiences life is giving you, you will change. You\u2019ll be able to produce better outcomes. You\u2019ll be able to stop doing the things that are keeping you in unhealthy patterns. Your personality will change, and it should. Personality is largely based on memory, which should be continuously changing and expanding with new connections and associations.\nI recently had a conversation with a friend who had a very transformational experience serving a 2-year humanitarian and service mission for his church. A self-proclaimed introvert, he said that every day of his mission was hard because he had to be an extrovert during those 2 years. Once he got home, he went right back to being an introvert.\nHe said that he actually believed he could have made permanent changes in his personality based on his experiences. However, he said that he preferred being an introvert. As such, he didn\u2019t really want to let his experiences sink-in. He didn\u2019t want to change who he was. There\u2019s too much \u201cunknown\u201d in that. And as research shows, the fear of the unknown is the foundation of all fears.\n\u201cWhy go against my preference?\u201d he asked me.\n\u201cI guess you don\u2019t need to if you\u2019re FULLY satisfied with the results you\u2019re currently getting and the trajectory you\u2019re on,\u201d I replied.\nWithout question, a person can upgrade their preferences. They can learn to love something they didn\u2019t love before which actually builds on core strengths.\nIdentity is like memory \u2014 it\u2019s infinite. You don\u2019t have to be just an introvert OR an extrovert. You can be a completely well-rounded person who absorbs and allows all of life experiences to transform and expand them. There\u2019s no need to put yourself into such a limiting box as a personality type.\nSo how do you become more open to new experiences?\nFirstly, you need to be humble, which means that you are open to the fact that your current way of seeing and doing things isn\u2019t the best way to do them. In other words, you need to be open to the fact that your current preferences aren\u2019t optimal, and can and should be upgraded.\nThe term \u201chumility\u201d comes from the Latin word humilitas, a noun related to the adjective humilis, which may be translated as \u201chumble\u201d, but also as \u201cgrounded\u201d, or \u201cfrom the earth.\u201d\nHumility and humidity are linguistically very connected and for good reason.\nThe word humidity is all about moisture and wetness. Humility, represents the soil. If the soil is humble, it absorbs the humidity. If the soil is not humble but hard, then it doesn\u2019t absorb the humidity.\nHumble soil accepts the nutrients that humidity brings it.\nSimilarly, humble people absorb new information and new experiences. They are changed by their experiences. They don\u2019t close themselves off to them. They don\u2019t revert back to old ways after life-changing experiences. Their learning becomes permanent and a part of them. Not temporary and forgotten.\nAre you humble?\nDo you absorb all that life is giving you?\nOr, like most people, are you closed-off to new experiences?\nDoes your learning become permanent, or is most of it forgotten and lost?\nDo you believe your preferences are the best approach? Or, are you willing to expand your vision for yourself and what you can be?\nAre you stuck in a personality type? Or do you realize that you as a person are infinite?\nMemory is infinite. So is a person\u2019s potential to change, if they\u2019re humble and open. If they begin behaving in powerful ways, their whole life will change.\nOne of the most powerful ways to get insights is by writing in your journal. If you\u2019re uncomfortable with the notion of prayer, you can obviously meditate instead.\nMeditation is without question, a very powerful tool.\nMeditation allows you to transform curiosity and action into reflection, which then can lead to better outcomes.\nHowever, as for myself, prayer takes meditation to a whole new level. If you believe in a higher power or \u201csource,\u201d then what could possibly be more powerful than proactively seeking connection with that source?\nMost of my best insights come while writing in my journal after I\u2019ve specifically prayed to get inspiration during my journaling session. This is a skill I\u2019ve developed over a decade and it\u2019s taught me how to receive continuous inspiration, clarity, and direction in my life.\nI\u2019ve learned how to journal in a stream-of-consciousness manner, wherein many unexpected ideas come to my mind while I\u2019m writing.\nWhile writing, people often come to my mind. After having read about Matthew Cowley, and seeking to become a better friend myself, I now send audio text messages to the people who come to my mind. I\u2019m grateful for the incredible technologies that allow me to develop deeper connections with friends and family.\nWhen someone pops into my mind, I step away from my journal for 1\u20132 minutes, send a powerful and genuine audio-text, and then continue on with my journaling.\nAs I\u2019ve done this:\nYour life can change when you start making your life more about other people. As Dan Sullivan has said, \u201cIn the end, we are only whom we have empowered.\u201d\nHere\u2019s the thing, when your life becomes about other people, that doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s not also about your goals. Instead, your goals just have a higher purpose. You show up differently to help more people, and also to be a better example to your loved ones.\nYou can absolutely balance a life of achievement and contribution. You can be wildly successful while at the same time being a good friend.\nSending audio-text messages over the past few weeks has changed my life. It\u2019s changed my relationships. And I believe my small notes have also had a very positive impact on the people I\u2019ve sent them to.\nHere are some questions for you to consider as you meditate and reflect upon this article:\nHopefully, this article has provided some insight into how you can begin answering these questions for yourself.\nAlso, hopefully, this article has inspired you to use your iPhone in a new way :)\nI\u2019ve created a cheat sheet for putting yourself into a PEAK-STATE, immediately.

Walking into their brand new office, with woodgrain finish, brand new coffee machine and views of the Grand Prix track was daunting.\nThe size of his work desk was the size of his ego. His business partner walked into the room with his slicked back hair, Armani Suit and two buttons undone to give that relaxed look. The topic of the meeting was sales leads (don\u2019t let that bore you, though).\nI was there to talk to these two gentlemen about sales leads with a colleague and the lack of them. The client was expecting 2000 leads per month, had launched their website a few weeks prior, had no social media presence and their 4\u20135 major competitors all had billion dollar businesses.\nIt was a tale of David and Goliath and they were not playing the part of either.\nBefore the scheduled time I agreed that my colleague would run the meeting to build up some experience in dealing with heated escalations. I was in the meeting only to observe, add some credibility and give him feedback at the end which would help him.\nThe client started off by telling us to talk about how we had got to where we were on that day while we looked at each other over a huge desk with egos ready to roar.\nMy colleague began fumbling around to try and explain it, but the words were not coming out. He opted to say as much as he possibly could. The two business owners were distracted the whole time. Every few minutes the door would swing open and the receptionist would whisper something and then walk out. Then one of the directors answered a call and said loudly \u201cI\u2019ll be there shortly\u201d signaling that he had more important places to be at.\nWhile the urge to talk was high, I sat in silence.\nOnce my colleague finished his summary, they began ripping us to shreds. They said that they liked dealing with the two of us but that the people we work with were no good, our product was broken, our strategy was wrong and that they were mis-sold. The feedback was gut-wrenching for the two of us given our weakness towards being obsessed with having happy clients.\nThe back and forth on both sides filled up most of our short meeting. Progress was not being made and we were losing the fight to what I\u2019d describe as a weak argument. In short, what they were expecting was impossible and if they thought about their concept of 2000 leads a month from a few hundred dollars, they\u2019d see what we could see.\nThe meeting was nearly over and I\u2019d still said nothing. My body language told the story the way Benjamin Franklin would of. Then, in an instance, one of the directors said:\n\u201cWhat do you think? We haven\u2019t heard you speak?\u201d\nI purposely left a few moments of silence. The two directors stopped being distracted by their phones for a moment.\nThen I said something that could have been career ending for me:\nThere was a further silence.\nI\u2019d struck a nerve by calling out the elephant in the room that can only be spotted by sitting in silence and watching everybody react.\nIt was no longer about egos. Honesty was what was missing and everyone knew it once I stated the obvious and used a swear word to emphasize my point. All I said for that entire meeting were those two sentences. I didn\u2019t speak another word.\nWith those two sentences, everyone\u2019s thoughts were interrupted. The initial intent of the client was to discontinue our service and potentially engage their lawyer. By the end of the meeting, we had rapport and an understanding that we\u2019d work to find a resolution.\nIn the Uber on the way back to the office, my colleague asked for feedback and he wasn\u2019t talking about what he\u2019d done well. I thought about it for a moment and tried to come up with something that would help him next time.\nIn a meeting that involves one or more people who are angry, having you talk your mouth off doesn\u2019t build momentum.\nOnce you listen for long enough, you\u2019ll hear the problem on repeat and then when the time is right, all you need to do is clearly articulate it to the room and leave some silence for people to contemplate it.\nWhen people set up meetings, they focus on what they\u2019re going to say and how they can cover off on as much as they can by the end of the meeting.\nIf the outcome involves influencing the rest of the people in the meeting to do something, letting them speak should be the focus. When people are heard first, they tend to listen to what you say when it\u2019s your turn.\nA quality outcome is better than a long meeting that leads nowhere, where everyone is being candid and honesty is not the center of attention.\nEfficiency and time management in meetings has become the focus when the aim shouldn\u2019t be productivity; the outcome should be to get a solution, an answer or an outcome.\nWhen time is short, you tend to be able to get to the heart of the issue quicker and ignore pleasantries, unnecessary stories and general time wasting.\nShort meetings create focus.\nI\u2019ve been in a few meetings over the years with entrepreneurs who achieved more success than I could muster up in twenty-five lifetimes and one thing has stood out to me:\nThese tycoons of business say less.\nSaying less forces people to be intrigued by you and this holds tremendous power which can solve some of the biggest challenges we face as a human race.\nThe meeting I described above will show you that when everyone in a room commits to being honest, an outcome can be reached in record time.\nStating how important honesty is in a meeting might seem useless, but when it\u2019s done properly, it reminds everybody what matters. Transparency is sexy and people appreciate it more than you think.\nAs humans, we tend to repeat patterns. In the context of a meeting with an angry client, this can lead both sides to focus on being right and defending their point of view with their ego.\nThe way to break the pattern is to use a few short sentences to interrupt everyone\u2019s thinking. Saying the one thing that everyone is too scared to say is the best solution I\u2019ve found.\nOnce the pattern of the meeting is broken, it forces people to think more deeply. When we\u2019re forced into these states, we find hidden solutions, empathy and our human side. Pattern interrupts open the door for rapport.\nIt\u2019s an excellent reflection of how the meeting is going. The ones who sit in silence may not speak any words, but they\u2019re telling you what they think by the way they\u2019re sitting/standing and the position of their arms.\nAnd that person may have the lowest status or title.\nThe one in a meeting saying the least can often have a very different perspective. The least qualified person may hold the most wisdom.\nI walk into meetings all the time being the least qualified and I\u2019ve found that to be a superpower more often than not.\nBeing the least qualified has also helped me dial my ego down and that\u2019s translated to better outcomes.\nPractice saying less.

He said to me one day, \u201cRyan, it\u2019s not enough that you read a lot. To do great things, you have to read to lead.\u201d\nWhat he meant was that in an age where almost nobody reads, you can be forgiven for thinking that the simple act of picking up a book is revolutionary. It may be, but it\u2019s not enough. Reading to lead means pushing yourself\u2013reading books \u201cabove your level.\u201d\nIn short, you know the books where the words blur together and you can\u2019t understand what\u2019s happening? Those are the books a leader needs to read. Reading to lead or learn requires that you treat your brain like the muscle that it is\u2013lifting the subjects with the most tension and weight.\nFor me, that means pushing ahead into subjects you\u2019re not familiar with and wresting with them until you can\u2013shying away from the \u201ceasy read.\u201d It means reading Feynman over Friedman, biographies over business books, and the classics over the contemporary.\nIt worked wonders for me: at 19, I was a Hollywood executive, I was at 21 I was the director of marketing for a publicly traded company, and at 24 I\u2019d worked on 5 bestselling books and sold my own to the biggest publisher in the world. I may have been a college drop out but I have had the best teachers in the world: tough books.\nMy apartment is filled with such books that on paper, I never should have been able to understand. It wasn\u2019t easy to crack them, but with the secrets below I was able to. And the process starts before you even crack the spine of a new book.\nBreak out of the School MindsetThe way you learn to read in the classroom is corrupted by the necessity of testing. Tests often have very little to do with proving that you know or care about the material but more about proving that you spent the time reading it. The easiest way to do this is picking obscure things from the text and quizzing you on them: \u201cName this passage\u201d \u201cWhat were the main characters in Chapter 4?\u201d We carry these habits with us. Remember: now you\u2019re reading for you.\nLet\u2019s say you\u2019re reading the History of the Peloponnesian War. That there was once a conflict between Corinth and Corcyra is not really worth remembering, even though the proxy fight kicked off the war between Athens and Sparta.\n(To write this, I had to look the names up myself, I only recalled that they started with a C)\nWhat you should latch onto is that as the two fought for allied support from Athens, one took the haughty \u201cyou owe us a favor\u201d route and the other alluded to all the benefits that would come from aiding them. Guess who won? Place. Names. Dates. These are unimportant. The lessons matter.\nFrom Seneca:\nForget everything but that message and how to apply it to your life.\nRuin the EndingWhen I start a book, I almost always go straight to Wikipedia (or Amazon or a friend) and ruin the ending. Who cares? Your aim as a reader is to understand WHY something happened, the what is secondary.\nYou ought to ruin the ending\u2013or find out the basic assertions of the book\u2013because it frees you up to focus on your two most important tasks:\nThe first 50 pages of the book shouldn\u2019t be a discovery process for you; you shouldn\u2019t be wasting your time figuring out what the author is trying to say with the book.\nInstead, your energy needs to be spent on figuring out if he\u2019s right and how you can benefit from it. Plus if you already know what happens, you can identify all the foreshadowing and the clues the first read through.\nRead the ReviewsFind out from the people who have already read it, what they felt was important. From Amazon to the New York Times, read the reviews so you can deduce the cultural significance of the work\u2013and from what it meant to others. Also by being warned of the major themes you can anticipate them coming and then actually appreciate them as they unfold.\nTip: if you agree with their assessment of the work, go ahead and steal it once you\u2019ve finished. You can\u2019t copyright an opinion\u2013this isn\u2019t school, this is life.\nRead the Intro/Prologe/Notes/ForwardI know, I know. It infuriates me too when what looks like a 200 page book turns out to have 80 pages of translator\u2019s introduction, but that stuff is important.\nEvery time I have skipped through it, I\u2019ve had to go back and start over. Read the intro, read all the stuff that comes before the book\u2013even read the editors notes at the bottom of the pages. This sets the stage and helps boost your knowledge going into the book.\nRemember: you need every advantage you can get to read a book above your level. Don\u2019t skip stuff intended to add context and color.\nLook It UpIf you\u2019re reading to lead, you\u2019re going to come across concepts or words you\u2019re not familiar with. Don\u2019t pretend like you understand, look it up. I like to use Definr or I use my phone to look stuff up on Wikipedia. With Military History, a sense of the battlefield is often necessary. Wikipedia is a great place to grab maps and to help understand the terrain.\nI was once trying to read some books on the Civil War and got stuck. 10 hours of Ken Burn\u2019s documentaries later, the books were easy to breeze through (see, looking stuff up can be as easy as watching TV) That being said, don\u2019t get bogged down with the names of the cities or the spelling of names, you\u2019re looking to grasp the meta-lesson: the conclusions.\nMark PassagesI love Post-It Flags. I mark every passage that interests me, that makes me think, that is important to the book. When I don\u2019t have them, I just fold the bottom corner of the page. (I actually folded the corner of every page of Heraclitus\u2019 Fragments). If there is something I need to look up, I fold the top corner of the page and return to it later.\nI carry a pen with me and write down whatever thoughts / feelings / connections I may have with a passage.\nIt\u2019s much better to do it in the moment than to risk losing the contemporaneous inspiration. Don\u2019t be afraid to tear the book up with tags and notations\u2013books are a cheap. Plus you\u2019ll get more for your money this way.\nGo Back ThroughI have the same schedule with every book I read. After a mandatory 1\u20132 week waiting period after finishing, I go back through the book with a stack of 4\u00d76 index cards. One these cards, I write out\u2013by hand\u2013all the passages I have noted as being important.\nIt might seem strange but it\u2019s an old tactic used by everyone from Tobias Wolff to Montaigne to Raymond Chandler. (Who once said: \u201cWhen you have to use your energy to put those words down, you are more apt to make them count.\u201d) Each one of these cards is then assigned a theme and filed in my index card box.\nThe result of 4\u20135 years of doing this? Thousands of cards in dozens of themes\u2013from Love to Education to Jokes to Musings on Death. I return to these pieces of wisdom when I am writing, when I need help or when I am trying to solve a business problem. It has been an immense resource.\nRead One Book from Every BibliographyThis is a little rule I try to stick with. In every book I read, I try to find my next one in its footnotes or bibliography. This is how you build a knowledge base in a subject\u2013it\u2019s how you trace a subject back to its core.\nJust keep a running list through Amazon\u2019s Wish List service (here is mine). Last month I read a book on Evolutionary Psychology and discovered that I\u2019d read almost 80% of its sources because I\u2019d been pulled down the rabbit hole of a predecessor.\nApply and UseYou highlight the passages for a reason. Why type the quotes if you aren\u2019t going to memorize and use them?\nDrop them in conversation. Allude to them in papers, in emails, in letters and in your daily life.\nHow else do you expect to absorb them?\nThe more fulfilling an outlet you find for the fruit of your database, the more motivated you will be to fill it. Try adding a line to a report you\u2019re doing, find solace in them during difficult times or add them to Wikipedia pages. Do something.\nI give you Seneca again:\nRemember: we read to lead for moral and practical lessons. The point is to take what we\u2019ve read and turn the words, as Seneca says, into works.\nOf course, none of this is easy. People always ask me if the books I carry around are for school because they\u2019re full of notes, flags and folded pages\u2013why would anyone work so hard on something they were doing on their own? Because I enjoy it, because it\u2019s the only thing that separates me from ignorance.\nThese are the techniques have allowed me to leap years ahead of my peers. It\u2019s how you strike out on your own and build strength instead of letting some personal trainer dictate what you can and can\u2019t be lifting.\nIt\u2019s also expensive, I\u2019ve purchased thousands of books and invested hours upon hours of time learning them. But how expensive is going back for an MBA? Or attending TED? I think there is more wisdom in the timeless books of the last 5,000 years than a conference or two\u2013if you do it right and push yourself.\nSo try it: Do your research, read diligently without getting bogged down in details, and then work to connect, apply and use. It\u2019s your job as a leader. And I think you\u2019ll find that you\u2019re able to read above your supposed \u201clevel\u201d and that people will follow your example. If you put in the work, books, as the great writer and voracious reader Petrarch once said, will pay you back:\nEnjoy the journey.\nI\u2019ve created a list of 15 books you\u2019ve never heard of that will alter your worldview and help you excel at your career.\nGet the secret book list here!\nThis originally appeared on Thought Catalog.\n", "claps": "69K claps", "author": "Ryan Holiday", "comments": [], "link": "https://medium.com/@RyanHoliday/how-to-digest-books-above-your-level-and-increase-your-intelligence-a11bd134da13"}, {"title": "Don\u2019t listen to those productivity gurus: why waking up at 6am won\u2019t make you successful", "num_comments": 398, "tags": ["productivity", "life", "entrepreneurship", "startup", "business"], "reading_time": 7, "text": "If you want to be successful, many experts and life-hackers say you should:\nWhew. That\u2019s a lot to accomplish before 8 am.\nI\u2019m not sure when the dogma of morning routines began to spread, but suddenly, these mile-long checklists are everywhere \u2014 especially in the startup world.\nRoutines can be great, but I think there\u2019s a misplaced emphasis on morning.\nEveryone has different peak hours. If you want to enhance your productivity, it doesn\u2019t matter whether you\u2019re a morning person or a night owl, or if you go for a run at 6 am or 6 pm.\nInstead, it\u2019s up to you to make the most of your day, and to learn when you work and feel your best. Brian Tracy calls this your prime time:\nHarnessing your prime time can supercharge your productivity. You\u2019ll be more effective and avoid wasting precious time and energy.\nI\u2019ve spent 12 years growing JotForm from a small idea to a company with over 100 employees and 3.5 million users. Working with my natural rhythms (which I discovered through trial and error) has been the cornerstone of that growth.\nTackling the most important, most strategic work during my prime time enables me to stay motivated, make steady progress, and avoid feeling overwhelmed.\nMost importantly, I still love what I do.\nWhen I harness my peak hours, I\u2019m excited to go to the office every day \u2014 and I want the same for you.\nScientists have long studied the body\u2019s natural cycles, or chronobiology.\nYou\u2019ve probably heard of circadian rhythms, which affect our sleep and waking cycles, body temperature, and hormone levels.\nIn the average workday, however, we\u2019re dealing with the peaks and valleys of ultradian rhythms, which run in 90\u2013120-minute cycles. Ultradian rhythms explain why you can start a task feeling excited and alert, then two hours later, you\u2019re checking Instagram and hunting for snacks.\nEnergy peaks and dips are normal (and unavoidable), so it\u2019s important to map your own rhythms and work with them, instead of against them.\nAuthor Yulia Yaganova suggests a three-week experiment where you rate your energy, focus and motivation at the end of every hour, using a scale from one to 10.\nFilling in productivity spreadsheets and energy maps might sound tedious, but you\u2019ll quickly see patterns.\nYou can throw out anomalies, like a sleepless night or a nasty cold, but you\u2019ll soon know your cycles \u2014 and how to capitalize on your prime time.\nA morning routine that works for a productivity guru won\u2019t always work for you.\nTake me as an example. Every morning, I eat a light breakfast and meet with my personal trainer. It doesn\u2019t matter whether I\u2019m feeling motivated or not; I show up and follow his orders.\nAbout 20 minutes into the workout, I get a surge of energy. My blood is pumping and I\u2019m working hard not to drop the kettle bell on my foot. I\u2019m awake.\nWhen my hour of benevolent torture is complete, I shower and drive to the office. I grab some coffee and get down to work.\nHonestly, it\u2019s one of my favorite moments of the day. I feel so fresh and alert. I\u2019m happy to be in the office, and my creativity is at its peak.\nThis is my prime time, so here\u2019s what I do next:\nI open a blank document and start writing about a problem I want to tackle that day or something that\u2019s on my mind. It often begins as an incoherent stream-of-consciousness, but after about five minutes, I start to develop new ideas. I find clarity in the chaos.\nI write for as long as I can, then transform the document into a usable format. It could be an email draft, meeting notes, discussion points, slideshow or a presentation for our team. I work this way for about two hours \u2014 and it\u2019s the most productive part of my day.\nAccording to Stephen Covey, this kind of intentional writing is one way to sharpen the saw. Instead of struggling with dull tools, Covey says we should spend more time sharpening the saw. When it\u2019s time to cut, you\u2019ll finish the task with efficiency and precision.\nMy prime time happens to be in the morning, but yours might be at noon or 7 pm. And maybe you renew your energy with a coffee date or an afternoon yoga class.\nDo whatever you can to seize that prime time and make the most of it.\nEntrepreneur and investor Paul Graham say most positions require one of two different working styles: the manager\u2019s schedule and the maker\u2019s schedule.\nWriters, programmers, designers, and other creatives need a maker\u2019s schedule, which divides time into half-day units, at minimum.\nAs you\u2019ve probably experienced, it\u2019s tough to write or code or think in a one-hour block \u2014 especially if you have meetings on either side of that hour.\nOverscheduling a maker can crush their entire day. It breaks time into unusable chunks and, as Graham explains, that kills productivity:\nI\u2019ve given this a lot of thought. Founders, entrepreneurs and CEOs are both makers and managers. You need to meet and collaborate with employees, contractors or suppliers, and you need to think strategically.\nIf you\u2019re a technology or content-based founder, you may also need time for hands-on work.\nIt comes down to the word \u201cbuild.\u201d When you\u2019re \u201cbuilding a business\u201d or \u201cbuilding a team,\u201d you\u2019re operating as a maker.\nThat\u2019s why I split my day in two. During those early hours after the gym, I work like a maker. By later morning or after lunch, I\u2019m back to having meetings and working like a manager.\nI\u2019m a huge proponent of rest. I wrote about its importance in \u201cHow to get more done with less work\u201d.\nI take the weekends off and I believe in regular, relaxing vacations. Once a year, I go back home to pick olives with my family. It\u2019s amazing how this time away from the office re-energizes my body and spirit. My downtime is essential.\nIn 2016, productivity expert Scott Barry Kaufman did a study that revealed 72% of people get creative ideas in the shower. I\u2019m definitely part of that group.\nOn Sundays, for example, I spend time with my wife and kids. We go to the playground, have lunch, or do something fun and active. By the time the kids are tucked into bed and I\u2019m resting on the couch, new ideas inevitably pop into my head.\nRelaxation promotes creative thinking, which is why we often have brain waves while soaping up or, in my case, after tackling the jungle gym with my son.\nLetting your mind wander freely can inspire daydreams and non-linear thinking. It\u2019s another kind of prime time.\nAnd for anyone who\u2019s wondering how to foster those shower-type brain waves at work, Kaufman says:\nWhile we\u2019ve yet to build a daydreaming room at JotForm, we do believe in giving our employees paid time off. We put some healthy pressure on our staff to actually use their vacation days, too.\nWe also encourage people to work with their peak hours. Our flex time policy allows everyone to come in early or start later.\nAs long as they spend most of the day with their team, tackling projects and building momentum together, they can honor their own rhythms.\nYour peak hours area a priceless currency. Draw clear boundaries and protect them however you can.\nUse that time for your toughest, most creative, or most brain-intensive tasks.\nDon\u2019t book meetings or let people disrupt you.\nConsistent habits can also safeguard your prime time. I\u2019ve written before about my commitment to Inbox Zero, but I don\u2019t tackle those emails until the end of the day.\nMy team knows I won\u2019t respond to their messages immediately, but I will reply (fully and thoughtfully) within one business day.\nClear expectations give me more control over my time.\nSo, whether you\u2019re laser-focused at 7 a.m. or hitting high gear as the sun sets, it\u2019s worth taking the time to understand yourself better. Track your natural rhythms and make a plan that works for you.\nAfter all, prime time is your secret weapon. Use it wisely and I suspect your productivity will soar.\n\u2014\nPlease let me know how you use your prime time. I\u2019d love to hear more.\nOriginally published at www.jotform.com.\n", "claps": "110K claps", "author": "Aytekin Tank", "comments": ["I have never by choice been one of those annoyingly early risers.

Why else go through all the pain and hardship? It\u2019s to achieve happiness in some way.\nAnd I\u2019m not the only person who believed that. In fact, if you look around you, most people are pursuing happiness in their lives.\nThat\u2019s why we collectively buy shit we don\u2019t need, go to bed with people we don\u2019t love, and try to work hard to get approval of people we don\u2019t like.\nWhy do we do these things? To be honest, I don\u2019t care what the exact reason is. I\u2019m not a scientist. All I know is that it has something to do with history, culture, media, economy, psychology, politics, the information era, and you name it. The list is endless.\nLet\u2019s just accept that.

Because when you read it, you think that happiness is the main goal. And that\u2019s kind of what the quote says as well.\nHappiness can\u2019t be a goal in itself. Therefore, it\u2019s not something that\u2019s achievable.\nI believe that happiness is merely a byproduct of usefulness.\nWhen I talk about this concept with friends, family, and colleagues, I always find it difficult to put this into words. But I\u2019ll give it a try here.\nMost things we do in life are just activities and experiences.\nThose things should make you happy, right? But they are not useful. You\u2019re not creating anything. You\u2019re just consuming or doing something. And that\u2019s great.\nDon\u2019t get me wrong. I love to go on holiday, or go shopping sometimes. But to be honest, it\u2019s not what gives meaning to life.\nWhat really makes me happy is when I\u2019m useful. When I create something that others can use. Or even when I create something I can use.\nFor the longest time I found it difficult to explain the concept of usefulness and happiness. But when I recently ran into a quote by Ralph Waldo Emerson, the dots finally connected.\nEmerson says:\nAnd I didn\u2019t get that before I became more conscious of what I\u2019m doing with my life. And that always sounds heavy and all. But it\u2019s actually really simple.\nDid you do useful things in your lifetime? You don\u2019t have to change the world or anything. Just make it a little bit better than before you were born.\nIf you don\u2019t know how, here are some ideas.\nThat\u2019s just some stuff I like to do. You can make up your own useful activities.\nYou see? It\u2019s not anything big. But when you do little useful things every day, it adds up to a life that is well lived. A life that mattered.\nThe last thing I want is to be on my deathbed and realize there\u2019s zero evidence that I ever existed.\nRecently I read Not Fade Away by Laurence Shames and Peter Barton. It\u2019s about Peter Barton, the founder of Liberty Media, who shares his thoughts about dying from cancer.\nIt\u2019s a very powerful book and it will definitely bring tears to your eyes. In the book, he writes about how he lived his life and how he found his calling. He also went to business school, and this is what he thought of his fellow MBA candidates:\nYou can say that about all of us. And after he realized that in his thirties, he founded a company that turned him into a multi-millionaire.\nAnother person who always makes himself useful is Casey Neistat. I\u2019ve been following him for a year and a half now, and every time I watch his YouTube show, he\u2019s doing something.\nHe also talks about how he always wants to do and create something. He even has a tattoo on his forearm that says \u201cDo More.\u201d\nMost people would say, \u201cwhy would you work more?\u201d And then they turn on Netflix and watch back to back episodes of Daredevil.\nBeing useful is a mindset. And like with any mindset, it starts with a decision. One day I woke up and thought to myself: What am I doing for this world? The answer was nothing.\nAnd that same day I started writing. For you it can be painting, creating a product, helping elderly, or anything you feel like doing.\nDon\u2019t take it too seriously. Don\u2019t overthink it. Just DO something that\u2019s useful. Anything.\nOriginally posted on dariusforoux.com.\nI\u2019ve made an eBook with 5 tips, exercises, and video training, that you can use to get immediate results.

An ambassador to Germany who declares he wants to...topple the German government. Senators \u2014 the most powerful people in democracy, save the President \u2014 knocking on the door of a \u201cdetainment center\u201d, looking for kids separated from their parents, only to be denied by guards who...laugh at them contemptuously, call the police, and have them shooed away like nobodies.\nDo Americans understand how much trouble they\u2019re now in? How grave the threat to America\u2019s constitutional democracy, its civil society, its place in the world, and its ongoing survival is? Now. When I ask this question, you\u2019ll protest: \u201cOf course I do!\u201d (or perhaps \u201cYou\u2019re overstating it!!\u201d, in which case the answer is already...no.) But I don\u2019t mean you, yourself. I am asking you to ask yourself about everyone else, perhaps the mythical average American.\nHere is a truth you would probably rather not hear.\nAmerica is at a crossroads. A point of no return. A democratic society cannot really survive the three assaults above, and go on being one. They may seem like just daily events in the ongoing sad saga of a troubled nation \u2014 but they are not just that. They contain great significance to history, which I feel American intellectuals are doing a poor job of interpreting and presenting to the American people. Let me take them one by one.\nWhen a society has a leader who claims to not just be above the law \u2014 but to be the law \u2014 then such a society cannot be a democracy, or a constitutional republic, a res publica, the \u201cpublic affair\u201d of the classical Greeks. When a leader has absolute power, then rights cannot be said to exist, and there is no point to voting, representation, or legislation. If the will of the people, or their representatives, can be abrogated at any time, by a leader who can \u201cpardon\u201d anyone absolutely for anything, beginning with himself, then democracy ceases to matter in any way whatsoever \u2014 that is how you get to \u201c90% of people vote for Putin!\u201d, every single election.\nNow, I am sure that you have had similar thoughts. But I want you to really understand it. When a society crosses this line, there is usually no going back. When Caesar crossed the Rubicon, Rome was finished. When the Sun King declared \u201cl\u2019etat, c\u2019est moi\u201d, \u201cI am the state\u201d, the French ancien regime was finished \u2014 the revolution was a foregone conclusion. And the same is true in America. If this line is crossed, there is likely to be no way back to democracy.\nBut the same is true of Senators who cannot \u201caccess\u201d a \u201cdetainment center\u201d \u2014 an altogether too-polite euphemism for a concentration camp, a place where people, children in this case, are literally concentrated, with no recourse or rights, simply vanished and disappeared into thin air, into a black hole. That is the point of a concentration camp \u2014 to create a black hole that is impossible for anyone to see into, for press, intellectuals, citizens, or even leaders.\nWhat is really happening here? Democratic representation is being made impotent \u2014 visibly and in public, so everyone can see just how powerless it is against authoritarianism. Authoritarians are demonstrating their absolute power to destroy the daily workings of democracy. Think about it: mere nobodies, flunkies, \u201cguards\u201d, call the police, who tell Senators, they must leave. They are able to render the most powerful people in society \u2014 Senators \u2014 utterly, totally, laughably impotent. But the Senators are the people\u2019s most powerful representatives, and if they cannot gain access to children hidden away in dungeons, then who can? No one. But that is precisely the point. It is a form of intimidation. Meant to create a society governed by fear, anxiety, impotence, the expectation of powerlessness \u2014 not one governed by law, order, and a democratic distribution of power.\nLike the last line, this line too, is usually irreversible \u2014 this line is the one of delegitimizing and disempowering the mechanism of democratic representation itself. Once Senators are made impotent, they do not easily regain the power to represent the people. Who in history was famous for such a thing? Caligula, of course, who once made his horse a Senator, or a consul, depending on legend. The point wasn\u2019t just to mock the people\u2019s representatives \u2014 it was to demonstrate how impotent they were. To demand their servility. To say that you are no better than yoked animals to me \u2014 and that is just how powerless you remain. I can find no example of history where once representation has been delegitimized, it is suddenly made powerful and strong again. It takes decades, usually \u2014 if it happens at all.\nNow let me come to the third line crossed in just this one fatal day \u2014 the ambassador who told an ally that he is out to quite literally bring down its government. What is the effect of this? It is to make America a pariah state. An international outcast, shunned, reviled, a society that civilized ones keep its distance from, lest its weakness infect them, too.\nAnd that is precisely what authoritarians want. Do you know how abusers isolate their victims \u2014 from friends, family, colleagues, twisting the truth, telling them that they are the only ones who are looking out for them, and the ones who genuinely care for them are the ones who will hurt them? In that way, isolated, alone, the victim is weakened, afraid, hesitant \u2014 and the abuser\u2019s job is easy. That is just what authoritarians do, too.\nWhy did the Soviets bring down an iron curtain? It wasn\u2019t really to protect people from decadent capitalism \u2014 it was to isolate them and keep them dumb, ignorant, and weak. Why do China, Saudi Arabia, and North Korea block and censor the internet and outside media? It isn\u2019t to make people virtuous \u2014 it is to keep them isolated, so that they never form bonds with anyone but their rulers.\nThis line too cannot be easily uncrossed. Once a society becomes a pariah state, it isn\u2019t as if people make friends with it again overnight. Think of how Russians are regarded by the world today. They are not exactly seen as the globe\u2019s most civilized people (sorry \u2014 let us just be honest). They are treated with suspicion, a little hostility, fear, and shame, wherever they go. That is because Russia is a pariah state, and the people of pariah states are not so easily loved or trusted again by their neighbours and peers. Bonds are broken. Friends becomes strangers and aliens to one another. Trust disintegrates. But anyone who has ever had a relationship knows: trust, once it is lost, is the hardest thing of all to repair.\nSo. Let me ask you again. Do you think Americans know how grave their plight is now? That they are at a crossroads? That they face all these dangers? Let me summarize them. Becoming a pariah state, shunned by the world. Becoming an authoritarian state, the rule of law shattered, in which absolute power is taken away from the people, and concentrated among the most ruthless, vicious, brutal, and inhumane (remember those flunkies, those \u201cguards\u201d, laughing and calling the police on Senators looking for missing kids?). And going from being an open, vibrant, optimistic society, to being something more like the Soviet Union \u2014 a place that, most troublingly of all, had no road back to being a democracy at all.\nPerhaps you yourself think I overstate the case. Perhaps I do. Still, I think it would be a very foolish thing to say: \u201clet history be the judge.\u201d Those are famous last words. So I will leave you with this. In times like these, it is reasonable to expect the worst, and unreasonable to go on hoping against hope for the best. That is not because I am a pessimist. It is because I am an optimist to the last, even in these grim and desperate times.\nUmairJune 2018\n", "claps": "27K claps", "author": "umair haque", "comments": [], "link": "https://eand.co/do-americans-know-how-much-trouble-theyre-in-78e8ef00d53c"}, {"title": "5 Things Socially Intelligent People Consistently Do", "num_comments": 28, "tags": ["life", "life lessons", "leadership", "relationships", "self improvement"], "reading_time": 6, "text": "I can\u2019t remember one time, growing up, where I felt confident around other people. Combine a severe speech impediment, moving every two years for my dad\u2019s job, and living in a world where most people expected some form of verbal communication, and on a daily basis, I experienced some form of social anxiety.\nHowever, after I graduated college, I realised since the world wasn\u2019t going to change, I would have to. A few days later, I started my first sales job.\nSome people focus on their strengths to win the life they want. I didn\u2019t. I choose the opposite, and by studying socially intelligent people, and taking the time to learn from my own successes and failures when interacting with others, I\u2019ve managed to improve my ability to connect with them. Fast forward to today and I make my living helping people do the same.\nAnd the best part is, by adopting the five actions below, you can get started boosting your social intelligence today.\nWhether it is the person holding the door, someone sharing the elevator, or the person serving them coffee, socially intelligent people acknowledge them and show them respect.\nThey do this because life has taught them that magic is everywhere, and everyone is capable of making it. Not only that, they also do this because they know the world is small, and people have a funny way of coming in and out of our lives.\nToday, steal a line from socially intelligent people, and the next time you leave the house, put down your phone and lift up your head. Then make it a point to smile and say hello to each person you pass. You may be surprised how memorable it is for the person on the receiving end. This is for the simple fact that most people today are so busy worrying about themselves, they fail to recognise the secret to happiness is literally standing in front of them.\nYou want to know who wins? Listeners do. Socially intelligent people understand this, and instead of constantly pushing their own agenda, they prioritise asking others about theirs.\nThe fastest way for people to like you, is by showing them that you like them. Socially intelligent people grasp this often over-looked aspect of human behaviour, and they use it to their advantage by asking questions that bring out the best in others. However, instead of being like most people, who instead of listening, think about only what they are going to say next, socially intelligent people shut up, and give the person they are speaking with their full presence.\nToday, when you are talking with someone, shut up. You may be surprised by how effective it is when it comes to building relationships.\nSocially intelligent people understand that the best problem-solver is a strong network. However, plenty of people know that. What separates socially intelligent people is they know that the best way to build their strong network, is by helping others to grow theirs.\nFriendships are best shared. Socially intelligent people live by this. This is because experience has shown them just how much one can truly get, when their default setting is locked on giving.\nToday, when someone is explaining a challenge they are facing, take a moment, and think about the people in your network who have faced a similar situation. Then take it one step further and make an introduction. You may just find that your tribe is not the only thing that grows, but also the meaning you have in your life. This is because few things matter more than helping others to reach their goals.\nSocially intelligent people enjoy nothing more than learning about the perspectives, thoughts, and feelings of the people around them. This is because they already know what they know, and what makes life fun for socially intelligent people, is learning about what other people know.\nNothing creates more opportunities than adopting the mindset of a student. Socially intelligent understand this, as a result, walk through each new door with the sole purpose of meeting a new someone, with the intention of learning a new something.\nOur only job is to leave each person better than we found them. Few things accomplish this better than giving someone the opportunity to teach. So today, with each door you walk through, be the student and soak in the perspectives, thoughts and feelings of those around you. Your relationships will thank you for it.\nSocially intelligent people do not sit around prior to doing something nice for someone thinking about whether the favor will be returned. Like John Maxwell said, \u201cKeeping score is for games, not friendships.\u201d Socially intelligent people understand this, and they give for the sake of giving because they know that doing good to others is always the right thing to do.\nToday when you have the opportunity to do something nice for someone, do not hesitate, and definitely do not think to yourself potential ways that you can benefit from this action. You may just find that by helping people to move their own needle, yours moves forward as well.\nWhen it comes to our IQ, genetics play a role and there is only so much we can do. However, fortunately, for both me and you, when it comes to raising our social intelligence, there is loads that we can do, and every encounter offers an opportunity to develop this skill.\nThere is no reason why each time you leave the house today you cannot acknowledge every person we come into contact with.\nThere is no reason why each time you have a conversation today you cannot prioritize listening to their agenda instead of pushing ours.\nThere is no reason why each time someone describes to you a problem they are facing, you cannot think about who in our network could help them solve it.\nThere is no reason why each time we meet with someone today you cannot adopt the mindset of a student, and allow the person in front of you to teach you a thing or two.\nThere is no reason why each time the opportunity to give presents itself today you cannot do just that, without expecting anything in return.\nMy mom got it dead right, \u201cNothing compounds faster than kindness.\u201d\nSo steal a line from my mom and be proactively good to people.\nToday.\nLiked this article?

Smiling, he kept the bird in his jaws and swam back to the old crocodile, adamant about showing him who the true hunter was.\nAs the young crocodile rounded the bend, he saw the elder crocodile still floating in the same spot near the river\u2019s edge.\nHowever, something had changed \u2014 a large wildebeest was enjoying an afternoon drink just inches near the old crocodile\u2019s head.\nIn one lightning fast movement, the old crocodile bolted out of the water, wrapped his jaws around the great wildebeest and pulled him under the river.\nAwestruck the young crocodile swam up with the tiny bird hanging from his mouth and watched as the old crocodile enjoyed his 500 lb meal.\nThe young crocodile asked him, \u201cPlease... tell me... how... how did you do that?\u201d\nThrough mouthfuls of wildebeest, the old crocodile finally responded,\nWhen I was first building JotForm, I was a lot like the young crocodile \u2014 believing that I always had to be doing something to get results.\nBack then, if someone would have told me that I would see greater results by spending more time doing nothing, I would have rolled my eyes and continued to chip away at my 16 hour day of work.\nI thought that in order to be successful, I had to constantly be building, working, growing and developing the next thing \u2014 whatever that \u201cthing\u201d was.\nAll of us have a problem with busyness. But being busy and being successful are not one in the same. And, I think if we were to make \u201cdoing nothing\u201d more of a priority, we might find ourselves catching more wildebeests versus measly catfish.\nIt worked for me, and I hope it can work for you, too.\nBut, doing less or nothing at all is easier said than done, especially in a society that suffers from extreme busyness. Let\u2019s take a closer look at our unhealthy obsession with staying busy...\nMankind has struggled with busyness since the beginning of time \u2014 or at least since 425 BC when Homer walked the Earth.\nThe Odyssey tells the tale of the Lotus-eaters \u2014 a strange people that slothed around all day long eating lotus and doing nothing. And, what was stranger than fiction was that these people were content with their lives.\nHomer wrote that after some of Odysseus\u2019s crew ate the Lotus-eaters Lotus fruit (say that three times fast), they became like the Lotus-eaters \u2014 content, relaxed and a bit lethargic.\nTerrified that if all of his men ate the lotus fruit they would be unmotivated to return home, Odysseus ordered the affected men to be tied to the ship benches and for the ship to set sail immediately.\nIt \u2019s interesting, Odysseus\u2019s reaction to this feeling of \u201cdoing nothing\u201d sounds similar to the Corporate CEO, the Startup Founder and the collegiate football coach we know today \u2014 hardcore workaholics that despise anything that might allude to a sense of complacency.\nThough, they of course are just the tip of a much larger societal iceberg that feels frozen with fear at the thought of doing nothing.\nThe world as a whole now measures value in terms of busyness versus quality of work. In many ways, it has become something of a status symbol to be \u201cbusy\u201d.\nHow many times have you heard or had a conversation like this...\nWe\u2019ve grown to subconsciously measure a person\u2019s worth based off how many hours they work, how much is on their plate and put simply \u2014 whether or not they are running around like a chicken with their head cut off.\nIn Tim Ferriss\u2019s 4-Hour Work Week, he pokes fun at this idea by facetiously saying that if you want a promotion, you should appear to be more busy by working longer hours, scrambling around and constantly answering emails.\nBut, sooner or later, all of us have to ask ourselves what our mission is \u2014 is it to be the busiest or is it to make the most impact?\nAnd, what\u2019s fascinating is that when we look at some of the greatest minds to grace planet Earth, we see an interesting commonality \u2014 they all make time for doing nothing.\nMaking time in your life to do nothing can be challenging \u2014 especially during the work week where we are constantly pummeled and bombarded with meetings, notifications and an ever growing list of tasks.\nBusy founders have started implementing \u201cThink Weeks\u201d into their annual schedules \u2014 week long periods they spend reflecting, reading, thinking and living outside the all-encapsulating world that is running a business.\nWhile young founders like Skillshare\u2019s Mike Karnjanaprakorn have adopted this practice, as well as big names like Steve Jobs, Mark Zuckerberg and Tim Ferriss, it was Bill Gates who originally made the Think Week famous.\nFor many years while running Microsoft, Gates would retreat into week long Think Weeks twice a year \u2014 not vacations, but actual periods of time dedicated to doing nothing.\nGates was so adamant about his Think Weeks that family, friends and Microsoft employees were banned. Today, Gates attributes much of Microsoft\u2019s success to the big ideas and concepts he stumbled upon while doing nothing.\nYou don\u2019t necessarily have to ban family and friends to retreat into a Think Week, though. Take me as an example.\nEvery year, I take at least a full week off from my company and head back to my hometown to help my parents with the olive harvest.\nAll thoughts of startup growth or conversion rates slip away when you\u2019re picking olives. It\u2019s meditative and calming.\nI know that olive picking won\u2019t land me at the top of TechCrunch, but it\u2019s a personal measure of success. And somehow, some of my best ideas come to me during this period.\nFor someone who can\u2019t take an entire week off of work once a year to do nothing, I recommend taking a slightly different approach \u2014 embracing the digital sabbath.\nOn either Saturday or Sunday, force yourself to step away from all forms of technology \u2014 a practice known as a digital sabbath.\nShut off your smartphone and hide it in your closet. Powerdown the laptop and slide it under your bed. And, try with all your might to refrain from binge-watching Netflix.\nGive your brain space to think by stepping away from the daily grind and doing nothing. Your mind will have time to stumble upon new ideas and further process old ones.\nYou may find the success that results from this practice to be similar to that of the old crocodile at the beginning of this article.\nWhile we tell ourselves we can achieve more by scrambling, sometimes it\u2019s better to close our eyes and just float.\nAnd, wait, until the wildebeest shows up.\nOriginally published at www.jotform.com.\n", "claps": "155K claps", "author": "Aytekin Tank", "comments": ["Along the same lines, you don\u2019t have to have an opinion:\u201cYou always own the option of having no opinion.

It\u2019s true of the leader of every nation which refuses to allow itself to be absorbed into the blob of the US-centralized power alliance, it\u2019s true of anti-establishment political candidates, and it\u2019s true of WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange.\nCorrupt and unaccountable power uses its political and media influence to smear Assange because, as far as the interests of corrupt and unaccountable power are concerned, killing his reputation is as good as killing him. If everyone can be paced into viewing him with hatred and revulsion, they\u2019ll be far less likely to take WikiLeaks publications seriously, and they\u2019ll be far more likely to consent to Assange\u2019s imprisonment, thereby establishing a precedent for the future prosecution of leak-publishing journalists around the world. Someone can be speaking 100 percent truth to you, but if you\u2019re suspicious of him you won\u2019t believe anything he\u2019s saying. If they can manufacture that suspicion with total or near-total credence, then as far as our rulers are concerned it\u2019s as good as putting a bullet in his head.\nThose of us who value truth and light need to fight this smear campaign in order to keep our fellow man from signing off on a major leap in the direction of Orwellian dystopia, and a big part of that means being able to argue against those smears and disinformation wherever they appear. Unfortunately I haven\u2019t been able to find any kind of centralized source of information which comprehensively debunks all the smears in a thorough and engaging way, so with the help of hundreds of tips from my readers and social media followers I\u2019m going to attempt to make one here. What follows is my attempt at creating a tool kit people can use to fight against Assange smears wherever they encounter them, by refuting the disinformation with truth and solid argumentation.\nThis article is an ongoing project which will be updated regularly where it appears on Medium and caitlinjohnstone.com as new information comes in and new smears spring up in need of refutation.\nHere\u2019s a numbered list of each subject I\u2019ll be covering in this article for ease of reference:\n0. How to argue against Assange smears.\nWow! That\u2019s a lot! Looking at that list you can only see two possibilities:\nAs it happens, historian Vijay Prashad noted in a recent interview with Chris Hedges that in 2008 a branch of the US Defense Department did indeed set out to \u201cbuild a campaign to eradicate \u2018the feeling of trust of WikiLeaks and their center of gravity\u2019 and to destroy Assange\u2019s reputation.\u201d\nLet\u2019s begin.\nBefore we get into refuting the specific points of disinformation, I\u2019d like to share a few tips which I\u2019ve found useful in my own experience with engaging people online who are circulating smears against Julian Assange.\nA \u2014 Be clear that your goal is to fight against a disinformation campaign, not to \u201cwin\u201d or to change the mind of the person you\u2019re arguing with.\nIf our interest is in advancing the cause of truth, we\u2019re not trying to get into arguments with people for egoic gratification, nor are we trying to change the mind of the smearer. Our first and foremost goal is to spread the truth to the people who are witnessing the interaction, who are always the target audience for the smear. Doesn\u2019t matter if it\u2019s an argument at the Thanksgiving dinner table or a Twitter thread witnessed by thousands: your goal is to disinfect the smear with truth and solid argumentation so everyone witnessing is inoculated from infection.\nSo perform for that audience like a lawyer for the jury. When the smearer refuses to respond to your challenges, when they share false information, when they use a logical fallacy, when they are intellectually dishonest, call it out and draw attention to what they\u2019re doing. When it comes to other subjects there are a wide range of opinions that may be considered right or wrong depending on how you look at them, but when it comes to the whether or not it\u2019s acceptable for Assange to be imprisoned for his publishing activities you can feel confident that you\u2019ll always have truth on your side. So use facts and good argumentation to make the smearer look worse than they\u2019re trying to make Assange look, thereby letting everyone know that this person isn\u2019t an honest and trustworthy source of information.\nB \u2014 Remember that whoever you\u2019re debating probably doesn\u2019t really know much about the claim they\u2019re making.\nLast night I had a guy confidently assuring me that Assange and Chelsea Manning had teamed up to get Donald Trump elected in 2016. Most people just bleat whatever they think they\u2019ve heard people they trust and people around them saying; when they make a claim about Assange, it\u2019s not usually because they\u2019ve done a ton of research on the subject and examined possible counter-arguments, it\u2019s because it\u2019s an unquestioned doctrine within their echo chamber, and it may never have even occurred to them that someone might question it.\nFor a perfect example of this, check out the New York Times\u2019 Bari Weiss experiencing an existential meltdown on The Joe Rogan Experience when the host simply asked her to substantiate her claim that Tulsi Gabbard is an \u201cAssad toadie\u201d. Weiss only ever operates within a tight establishment echo chamber, so when challenged on a claim she\u2019d clearly only picked up secondhand from other people she turned into a sputtering mess.\nMost people you\u2019ll encounter who smear Assange online are pulling a Bari Weiss to some extent, so point out the obvious gaps in their knowledge for the audience when they make nonsensical claims, and make it clear to everyone that they have no idea what they\u2019re talking about.\nC \u2014 Remember that they\u2019re only ever running from their own cognitive dissonance.\nCognitive dissonance is the psychological discomfort we experience when we try to hold two strongly contradictory ideas as true at the same time, like the idea that we live in a free liberal democracy and the idea that a journalist is being imprisoned for publishing facts about the US government right in front of us.\nRank-and-file citizens generally help the mass media propagandists smear Assange not to help protect the world from the influence of a dangerous individual, but to protect themselves from cognitive dissonance. People find themselves eager to believe smears about Assange because the raw facts revealed by WikiLeaks publications punch giant holes in the stories about the kind of world, nation and society that most people have been taught to believe they live in since school age. These kinds of beliefs are interwoven with people\u2019s entire egoic structures, with their sense of self and who they are as a person, so narratives which threaten to tear them apart can feel the same as a personal attack. This is why you\u2019ll hear ordinary citizens talking about Assange with extreme emotion as though he\u2019d attacked them personally; all he did was publish facts about the powerful, but since those facts conflict with tightly held identity constructs, the cognitive dissonance he caused them to experience can be interpreted as feeling like he\u2019d slapped them in the face.\nOrdinary citizens often find themselves eager to believe the smear campaigns against Assange because it\u2019s easier than believing that their government would participate in the deliberate silencing and imprisoning of a journalist for publishing facts. The fact that Assange\u2019s persecution is now exposing the ugly face of imperial tyranny presents them with even more to defend.\nIt might look like they\u2019re playing offense, but they\u2019re playing defense. They\u2019re attacking Assange because they feel the need to defend themselves from cognitive dissonance.\nIf people are acting strangely emotional and triggered when it comes to the issue of imprisoning Assange, it\u2019s got very little to do with facts and everything to do with the dynamics of psychological identity structures. There\u2019s not necessarily any benefit in pointing this out during a debate, but it helps to understand where people are coming from and why they\u2019re acting that way. Keep pointing out that people\u2019s feelings have no bearing on the threats that are posed to all of us by Assange\u2019s prosecution.\nD \u2014 Remember that the burden of proof is on the one making the claim.\n\u201cProve your claim.\u201d Use this phrase early and often. It\u2019s amazing how frequently I see people blurting out assertions about Assange that I know for a fact they have no way of proving: that he\u2019s a Russian agent, that he\u2019s a rapist, that he\u2019s a CIA asset, etc, which ties in with Point B above. The burden of proof is always on the party making the claim, so if they refuse to do this you can publicly dismiss their argument. If someone comes in making a specific claim about Assange, make them present the specific information they\u2019re basing their claim on so that you can refute it. If they refuse, call them out on it publicly. Never let them get away with the fallacious tactic of shifting the burden of proof onto you, and remember that anything which has been asserted without evidence may be dismissed without evidence.\nE \u2014 Never let them trick you into expending more energy than they\u2019re expending.\nThis one\u2019s important. The internet is full of genuinely trollish individuals who spend their time acting out their inner pain by trying to suck the life out of other people, and political discussion is certainly no exception to this. A common tactic is to use short phrases, half-thoughts, or word salads which contain few facts and no actual arguments, but contain just enough of a jab to suck you into wasting energy making thorough, well-sourced arguments while they just lean back and continue making weak, low-energy responses to keep you going. This enables them to waste your time and frustrate you while expending little energy themselves, while also not having to reveal the fact that they don\u2019t know much about the subject at hand and don\u2019t really have an argument.\nDon\u2019t let them lean back. Force them to lean in. If someone makes an unsubstantiated assertion, a brief quip, or a vague insinuation, tell them \u201cMake an actual argument using complete thoughts or go away.\u201d If they throw an unintelligible word salad at you (a tactic that is also common in abusers with narcissistic personality disorder because it tricks the abusee into falling all over themselves guessing how to respond appropriately, thereby giving the abuser power), tell them \u201cThat\u2019s gibberish. Articulate yourself using clear arguments or go away.\u201d\nThis often enrages them, partly because they\u2019ve generally been getting away with this tactic their entire lives so they feel entitled to demand compliance with it from you, and partly because you\u2019re forcing a very unconscious and unattractive part of themselves into attention and consciousness. But if they\u2019re interested in having a real and intellectually honest debate they\u2019ll do it; if they\u2019re not they won\u2019t. If they refuse to provide you with lucid, complete arguments that meet their burden of proof, make a show of dismissing them for their refusal to do so, and say you\u2019re doing it because they\u2019re too dishonest to have a real debate.\nNever chase them. Make them chase you. Never let them lead the dance chasing them around trying to correct their straw man reframing of your actual words or guessing what their word salads are trying to articulate. Make them do the work they\u2019re trying to make you do. Force them to either extend themselves into the light where their arguments can be properly scrutinized, or to disqualify themselves by refusing to.\nF \u2014 When attacking disinformation on Twitter, use this tactic:\nIf you see a high-profile Twitter account sharing disinformation about Assange, debunk their disinfo as clearly and concisely as possible, then retweet your response to your followers. Your followers will like and retweet your response, sending it further up the thread so that casual viewers of the disinfo tweet will often also see your response debunking it. If your response is text-only, include a screenshot or the URL of the tweet you\u2019re responding to before retweeting your response so that your followers can see the awful post you\u2019re responding to. It comes out looking like this:\nThis serves the dual function of offsetting the damage done by their smear and alerting your followers to come and help fight the disinfo.\nG \u2014 Point out at every opportunity that they are advancing a smear.\nNever miss an opportunity to point out to everyone witnessing the exchange that the other party is advancing a smear that is being promulgated by the mass media to manufacture consent for the imprisonment of a journalist who exposed US war crimes. Keep the conversation in context for everyone: this isn\u2019t just two people having a difference of opinion, this is one person circulating disinformation which facilitates the agendas of the most powerful people in the world (including the Trump administration, which you should always point out repeatedly if you know they hate Trump), and the other person trying to stop the flow of disinfo. Every time you expose a hole in one of their arguments, add in the fact that this is a dishonest smear designed to benefit the powerful, and that they are helping to advance it.\nH \u2014 Make it about Assange\u2019s imprisonment and extradition.\nOne of the very few advantages to Assange being behind bars in the UK\u2019s version of Guantanamo Bay instead of holed up in the Ecuadorian embassy is that the arguments are so much clearer and more honest now. You can no longer get away with claiming that Assange is just a coward hiding from justice who can \u201cleave whenever he wants\u201d and present yourself as merely a casual observer who just happens to want to share his opinion that the WikiLeaks founder is a fascist Russian spy rapist who smells bad and mistreats his cat, because you will always be entering a discussion involving the fact that Assange is in prison awaiting extradition to the United States. You are therefore always necessarily either supporting the extradition or distracting from the conversation about it.\nSo make that clear to everyone watching. Make them own it. They either support the imprisonment and extradition of Assange for his role in the Manning leaks, or they\u2019re interrupting grown-ups who are trying to have an adult conversation about it. If they support Assange\u2019s imprisonment and extradition to the United States, that clarifies your line of argumentation, and it makes them look like the bootlicking empire sycophants they are. Keep the fact that they support the extradition and imprisonment of a journalist for publishing facts on the front burner of the conversation, and keep making them own it.\nI \u2014 Familiarize yourself with common logical fallacies.\nIt\u2019s fascinating how often people resort to fallacious debate tactics when arguing about Assange. One of the most interesting things to me right now is how the unconscious behaviors of our civilization is mirrored in the unconsciousness of the individuals who support those behaviors. Those who support Assange\u2019s persecution are generally very averse to an intellectually honest relationship with their own position, and with the arguments against their position that they encounter.\nSo get familiar with basic fallacious debate tactics like straw man arguments (claiming that you have a position that is different from the one you\u2019ve actually put forth and then attacking that fake position they invented, e.g. \u201cYou\u2019re defending Assange because you worship him and think he\u2019s perfect\u201d), ad hominems (using personal attacks instead of an argument, e.g. \u201cAssange is stinky and smeared poo on the embassy walls\u201d), and appeals to emotion (using emotionally charged statements as a substitute for facts and reason, e.g. \u201cYou\u2019re defending Assange because you\u2019re a rape apologist\u201d). These will give you a conceptual framework for those situations where it feels like the person you\u2019re arguing with is being squirmy and disingenuous, but you can\u2019t really put your finger on how.\nJ \u2014 Rely as much on fact and as little on opinion as possible.\nDon\u2019t get sucked into emotional exchanges about opinions. Facts are what matter here, and, as you will see throughout the rest of this article, the facts are on your side. Make sure you\u2019re familiar with them.\nAnd now for the smears:\nYes he is. Publishing relevant information so the public can inform themselves about what\u2019s going on in their world is the thing that journalism is. Which is why Assange was just awarded the GUE/NGL Award for \u201cJournalists, Whistleblowers and Defenders of the Right to Information\u201d the other day, why the WikiLeaks team has racked up many prestigious awards for journalism, and why Assange is a member of Australia\u2019s media union. Only when people started seriously stressing about the very real threats that his arrest poses to press freedoms did it become fashionable to go around bleating \u201cAssange is not a journalist.\u201d\nThe argument, if you can call it that, is that since Assange doesn\u2019t practice journalism in a conventional way, there\u2019s no way his bogus prosecution for his role in the Manning leaks could possibly constitute a threat to other journalists around the world who might want to publish leaked documents exposing US government malfeasance. This argument is a reprisal of a statement made by Trump\u2019s then-CIA director Mike Pompeo, who proclaimed that WikiLeaks is not a journalistic outlet at all but a \u201chostile non-state intelligence service\u201d, a designation he made up out of thin air the same way the Trump administration designated Juan Guaido the president of Venezuela, the Golan Heights a part of Israel, and Iran\u2019s military a terrorist organization. Pompeo argued that since WikiLeaks was now this label he made up, it enjoys no free press protections and shall therefore be eliminated.\nSo they\u2019re already regurgitating propaganda narratives straight from the lips of the Trump administration, but more importantly, their argument is nonsense. As I discuss in the essay hyperlinked here, once the Assange precedent has been set by the US government, the US government isn\u2019t going to be relying on your personal definition of what journalism is; they\u2019re going to be using their own, based on their own interests. The next time they want to prosecute someone for doing anything similar to what Assange did, they\u2019re just going to do it, regardless of whether you believe that next person to have been a journalist or not. It\u2019s like these people imagine that the US government is going to show up at their doorstep saying \u201cYes, hello, we wanted to imprison this journalist based on the precedent we set with the prosecution of Julian Assange, but before doing so we wanted to find out how you feel about whether or not they\u2019re a journalist.\u201d\nPure arrogance and myopia.\nHyperlink to this section as its own article here.\nThe feedback I\u2019ve gotten while putting together this article indicates that this is the one Assange defenders struggle with most, and understandably so: it\u2019s a complex situation involving multiple governments, a foreign language, a foreign legal system, lots of legal jargon, many different people, some emotionally triggering subject matter, and copious amounts of information. These layers of complexity are what smearers rely upon when circulating this smear; most people don\u2019t understand the dynamics, so it\u2019s not evident that they\u2019re ingesting disinfo.\nBut just because the nature of the allegation is complex doesn\u2019t mean the argument is.\nThe strongest, simplest and most obvious argument against the \u201crapist\u201d smear is that it\u2019s an unproven allegation which Assange has always denied, and you\u2019d have to be out of your mind to believe a completely unproven allegation about a known target of US intelligence agencies. It\u2019s just as stupid as believing unproven claims about governments targeted for US regime change, like believing Saddam had WMD. The fact of the matter is that if you go up against America\u2019s opaque and unaccountable government agencies, they have \u201csix ways from Sunday of getting back at you,\u201d to quote from the Gospel of Schumer.\nI know we\u2019ve all been told that we have to unquestioningly believe all women who say they\u2019ve been raped, and as a general practice it\u2019s a good idea to tear away our society\u2019s patriarchal habit of dismissing anyone who says they\u2019ve been raped. But as soon as you make that into a hard, rigid rule that can\u2019t have any room for questioning the agendas of the powerful, you can be one hundred percent certain that the powerful will begin using that rule to manipulate us.\nThe people aggressively promoting the \u201crapist\u201d narrative and saying \u201cYou have to believe women!\u201d do not care about rape victims, any more than all the Hillary supporters saying \u201cBernie says you have to behave!\u201d after the 2016 convention cared about Bernie. Earlier this month I had my Twitter privileges suspended when I went off on a virulent Assange hater who said I was lying about having survived multiple rapes myself, while continuing to bleat his \u201cbelieve all women\u201d schtick. The political/media class of the western empire, which never hesitates to support the violent toppling of sovereign governments and all the death, destruction, chaos, terrorism, suffering, and, yes, rape which necessarily comes along with those actions, does not care about rape victims in Sweden.\nYou could spend days combing through all the articles that have been written about the details of the Swedish preliminary investigation, but let me try to sum it up as concisely as possible:\nLaws about consent and rape are significantly different in Sweden from most other societies. Assange had consensual sex with two women, \u201cSW\u201d and \u201cAA\u201d in Sweden in August 2010. SW and AA were acquainted with each other and texted about their encounters and, after learning about some uncomfortable sexual experiences SW said she\u2019d had with Assange, AA convinced SW to go to the police together to compel Assange to take an AIDS test. AA took her to see her friend and political ally who was also a police officer. SW said one of the times Assange had initiated sex with her happened while she was \u201chalf-asleep\u201d (legally and literally very different from asleep) and without a condom, and AA said Assange had deliberately damaged his condom before using it. SW freaked out when she learned the police wanted to charge Assange with rape for the half-asleep incident, and refused to sign any legal documents saying that he had raped her. She sent a text that she \u201cdid not want to put any charges against JA but the police wanted to get a grip on him,\u201d and said she had been \u201crailroaded by police and others around her.\u201d AA went along with the process.\nTo gain a basic understanding of the events through 2012, I highly recommend taking ten minutes to watch this animated video:\nMore info:\nFor more information on the details of the rape accusation, check out the following resources:\nFor some feminist essays on the infuriating hypocrisy of the entire patriarchal empire suddenly caring so, so deeply about the possibility that a man might have initiated sex in an inappropriate way, check out:\nI see a lot of well-meaning Assange defenders using some very weak and unhelpful arguments against this smear, suggesting for example that having unprotected sex without the woman\u2019s permission shouldn\u2019t qualify as sexual assault or that if AA had been assaulted she would necessarily have conducted herself differently afterward. Any line of argumentation like that is going to look very cringey to people like myself who believe rape culture is a ubiquitous societal illness that needs to be rolled back far beyond the conventional understanding of rape as a stranger in a dark alley forcibly penetrating some man\u2019s wife or daughter at knifepoint. Don\u2019t try to justify what Assange is accused of having done, just point out that there\u2019s no actual evidence that he is guilty and that very powerful people have clearly been pulling some strings behind the scenes of this narrative.\nFinally, the fact remains that even if Assange were somehow to be proven guilty of rape, the argument \u201che\u2019s a rapist\u201d is not a legitimate reason to support a US extradition and prosecution which would set a precedent that poses a threat to press freedoms everywhere. \u201cHe\u2019s a rapist\u201d and \u201cIt\u2019s okay that the western legal system is funneling him into the Eastern District of Virginia for his publishing activities\u201d are two completely different thoughts that have nothing whatsoever to do with each other, so anyone attempting to associate the two in any way has made a bad argument and should feel bad.\nHyperlink to this section as its own article here.\nNo he wasn\u2019t, he was hiding from US extradition. And his arrest this month under a US extradition warrant proved that he was right to do so.\nPeople who claim Assange was \u201chiding from rape charges\u201d are necessarily implicitly making two transparently absurd claims: one, that Assange had no reason to fear US extradition, and two, that Ecuador was lying about its official reasons for granting him asylum \u2014 that in fact the Correa government was just in the business of protecting people from rape charges for some weird reason.\nFor its part, the Ecuadorian government was crystal clear in its official statement about the reasons it was providing Assange asylum, saying that \u201cthere are serious indications of retaliation by the country or countries that produced the information disclosed by Mr. Assange, retaliation that can put at risk his safety, integrity and even his life,\u201d and that \u201cthe judicial evidence shows clearly that, given an extradition to the United States, Mr. Assange would not have a fair trial, he could be judged by a special or military court, and it is not unlikely that he would receive a cruel and demeaning treatment and he would be condemned to a life sentence or the death penalty, which would not respect his human rights.\u201d\nA lot of the rank-and-file Assange haters you\u2019ll encounter on online forums are just completely clueless about what political asylum is and how it works, because they receive their information from the same mass media which led seventy percent of Americans to still believe Saddam was behind 9/11 six months after the Iraq invasion. They either believe that (A) Assange found some strange loophole which enabled him to hide from all criminal charges simply by staying in an embassy, without any permission from that embassy\u2019s government, or that (B) the Ecuadorian government hands out political asylum willy nilly to anyone who\u2019s been accused of sexual assault. These beliefs can only be maintained by a rigorous determination not to think about them too hard.\nAssange wasn\u2019t hiding from justice, he was hiding from injustice. His sole concern has only ever been avoiding extradition and an unjust trial, which was why he offered to go to Sweden to be questioned if they would only provide assurances that he wouldn\u2019t face onward extradition to the US. Sweden refused. America refused. Now why would they do that? If Sweden were really only interested in resolving a rape investigation, why wouldn\u2019t they provide assurances that they wouldn\u2019t extradite him to the United States in order to accomplish that?\nThe fact that Assange was perfectly willing to travel to Sweden and see the investigation through is completely devastating to the \u201che\u2019s hiding from rape charges\u201d smear, and it casts serious doubt on the \u201che\u2019s a rapist\u201d smear as well.\nThe US government tortured Chelsea Manning. Trump\u2019s current CIA Director was called \u201cBloody Gina\u201d because of her fondness for torture on CIA black sites. He had every reason to be mortally afraid of extradition, and to remain so. The correct response to anyone claiming Assange should have done anything which could have allowed him to be extradited is, \u201cHow well do you think you\u2019d fare under torture, tough guy?\u201d\nHyperlink to this section as its own article here.\nNot even the US government alleges that WikiLeaks knowingly coordinated with the Kremlin in the 2016 publication of Democratic Party emails; the Robert Mueller Special Counsel alleged only that Guccifer 2.0 was the source of those emails and that Guccifer 2.0 was a persona covertly operated by Russian conspirators. The narrative that Assange worked for or knowingly conspired with the Russian government is a hallucination of the demented Russia hysteria which has infected all corners of mainstream political discourse. There is no evidence for it whatsoever, and anyone making this claim should be corrected and dismissed.\nBut we don\u2019t even need to concede that much. To this day we have been presented with exactly zero hard evidence of the US government\u2019s narrative about Russian hackers, and in a post-Iraq invasion world there\u2019s no good reason to accept that. We\u2019ve seen assertions from opaque government agencies and their allied firms within the US-centralized power alliance, but assertions are not evidence. We\u2019ve seen indictments from Mueller, but indictments are assertions and assertions are not evidence. We\u2019ve seen claims in the Mueller report, but the timeline is riddled with plot holes, and even if it wasn\u2019t, claims in the Mueller report are not evidence. This doesn\u2019t mean that Russia would never use hackers to interfere in world political affairs or that Vladimir Putin is some sort of virtuous girl scout, it just means that in a post-Iraq invasion world, only herd-minded human livestock believe the unsubstantiated assertions of opaque and unaccountable government agencies about governments who are oppositional to those same agencies.\nIf the public can\u2019t see the evidence, then as far as the public is concerned there is no evidence. Invisible evidence is not evidence, no matter how many government officials assure us it exists.\nThe only reason the majority believes that Russia is known to have interfered in America\u2019s 2016 election is because news outlets have been repeatedly referring to this narrative as an established and proven fact, over and over and over again, day after day, for years. People take this repetition as a substitute for proof due to a glitch in human psychology known as the illusory truth effect, a phenomenon which causes our brains to tend to interpret things we\u2019ve heard before as known truths. But repetitive assertions are not the same as known truths.\nFor his part, Julian Assange has stated unequivocally that he knows for a fact that the Russian government was not WikiLeaks\u2019 source for the emails, telling Fox News in January 2017 that \u201cour source is not the Russian government or any state party.\u201d You may be as skeptical or as trusting of his claim as you like, but the fact of the matter is that no evidence has ever been made public which contradicts him. Any claim that he\u2019s lying is therefore unsubstantiated.\nThis is the best argument there is. A lot of people like to bring up the fact that there are many experts who dispute the Russian hacking narrative, saying there\u2019s evidence that the DNC download happened via local thumb drive and not remote exfiltration, but in my opinion that\u2019s generally poor argumentation when you\u2019re disputing the narrative about WikiLeaks\u2019 source. It\u2019s a poor tactic because it shifts the burden of proof onto you, making yourself into the claimant and then forcing you to defend complicated claims about data transfer rates and so on which most people viewing the argument won\u2019t understand, even if you do. There\u2019s no reason to self-own like that and put yourself in a position of playing defense when you can just go on the offense with anyone claiming to know that Russia was WikiLeaks\u2019 source and just say \u201cProve your claim,\u201d then poke holes in their arguments.\nThere is no evidence that Assange ever provided any assistance to the Russian government, knowingly or unknowingly. In fact, WikiLeaks has published hundreds of thousands of documents pertaining to Russia, has made critical comments about the Russian government and defended dissident Russian activists, and in 2017 published an entire trove called the Spy Files Russia exposing Russian surveillance practices.\nOf course, the only reason this smear is coming up lately is because people want to believe that the recent imprisonment of Julian Assange has anything to do with the 2016 WikiLeaks email publications. It isn\u2019t just the propagandized rank-and-file who are making this false claim all over the internet, but Democratic Party leaders like Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer and Center for American Progress president Neera Tanden. As we should all be aware by now, Assange\u2019s completely illegitimate arrest in fact had nothing whatsoever to do with 2016 or Russia, but with the 2010 Manning leaks exposing US war crimes. Anyone claiming otherwise is simply informing you that they are brainwashed by Russia conspiracy theories and have no interest in changing that character flaw.\nThe smearer may claim \u201cWell, he toes the Kremlin line!\u201d When you ask them to explain what that means, they\u2019ll tell you it means that WikiLeaks speaks out against western interventionist and war propaganda narratives like Trump\u2019s bombing of Syria, or their criticism of the establishment Russia narrative which tries to incriminate WikiLeaks itself. That\u2019s not \u201ctoeing the Kremlin line,\u201d that\u2019s being anti-interventionist and defending yourself from evidence-free smears. Nobody who\u2019s viewed their 2010 video Collateral Murder will doubt that criticism of the US war machine is built into the DNA of WikiLeaks, and is central to its need to exist in the first place.\nIn reality, anyone who opposes western interventionism will see themselves tarred as Russian agents if they achieve a high enough profile, and right-wing empire sycophants were fond of doing so years before the brainwashed Maddow Muppets joined them. Russia, like many sovereign nations, opposes western interventionism for its own reasons, so anyone sufficiently dedicated to their own mental contortions can point at a critic of western imperialism and say \u201cLook! They oppose this subject, and so does Russia! They\u2019re the same thing!\u201d In reality a westerner opposing western interventionism is highly unlikely to have any particular loyalty to Russia, and opposes western interventionism not to protect their own geostrategic agendas as Moscow does, but because western interventionism is consistently evil, deceitful and disastrous.\nThe smearer may claim, \u201cWell he had a show on RT in 2012!\u201d So? What other network would air a TV program hosted by Julian Assange? Name one. I\u2019ll wait. If you can\u2019t name one, consider the possibility that Assange\u2019s appearances on RT were due to the fact that western mass media have completely deplatformed all antiwar voices and all criticism of the political status quo, a fact they could choose to change any time and steal RT\u2019s entire audience and all their talent. The fact that they choose not to shows that they\u2019re not worried about RT, they\u2019re worried about dissident thinkers like Assange.\nIn reality, Assange\u2019s 2012 show \u201cThe World Tomorrow\u201d was produced separately from RT and only picked up for airing by that network, in exactly the same way as Larry King\u2019s show has been picked up and aired by RT. Nobody who isn\u2019t wearing a tinfoil pussyhat believes that Larry King is a Russian agent, and indeed King is adamant and vocal about the fact that he doesn\u2019t work for RT and takes no instruction from them.\nThe only people claiming that Assange is a Russian agent are those who are unhappy with the things that WikiLeaks publications have exposed, whether that be US war crimes or the corrupt manipulations of Democratic Party leaders. It\u2019s a completely unfounded smear and should be treated as such.\nHyperlink to this section as its own article here.\nNo, he\u2019s being prosecuted for journalism. Assange is being prosecuted based on the exact same evidence that the Obama administration had access to when it was investigating him to see if he could be prosecuted for his role in the Manning leaks, but the Obama administration ruled it was impossible to prosecute him based on that evidence because it would endanger press freedoms. This is because, as explained by The Intercept\u2019s Micah Lee and Glenn Greenwald, the things Assange is accused of doing are things journalists do all the time: attempting to help a source avoid detection, taking steps to try to hide their communications, and encouraging Manning to provide more material. This is all Assange is accused of; there is no \u201chacking\u201d alleged in the indictment itself.\nJoe Emersberger of Fair.org notes the following:\nThe only thing that changed between the Obama administration and the Trump administration is an increased willingness to attack journalism. Assange is being prosecuted for journalism.\nFurthermore, there\u2019s every reason to believe that this new charge which the Trump administration pulled out of thin air is only a ploy to get Assange onto US soil, where he can be smashed with far more serious charges including espionage. Pentagon Papers lawyer James Goodale writes the following:\nIf that happens, Assange will not be spending the five years behind bars for computer offenses that his current charge allows, he\u2019ll be spending decades.\n\u201cI don\u2019t think Julian is looking at five years in prison, I think he\u2019s probably looking at 50 years in prison,\u201d said CIA whistleblower John Kiriakou, who was the first person tried in the US for leaking classified materials to a journalist under Obama\u2019s crackdown on whistleblowers.\n\u201cI think that there are many more charges to be considered for Julian,\u201d Kiriakou added. \u201cI would expect a superseding indictment, possibly to include espionage charges.\u201d\nThere is no legitimate reason to feel confident that this won\u2019t happen, and there are many reasons to believe that it will. All for publishing truthful documents about the powerful. Assange is being prosecuted for journalism.\nIt\u2019s also worth noting here that President Executive Order 13526, section 1.7 explicitly forbids the classification of material in order to hide government malfeasance, meaning it\u2019s perfectly reasonable to argue that Manning did not in fact break a legitimate law, and that those prosecuting her did.\n\u201cIn no case shall information be classified, continue to be maintained as classified, or fail to be declassified in order to: (1) conceal violations of law, inefficiency, or administrative error; (2) prevent embarrassment to a person, organization, or agency,\u201d the section reads, while Manning\u2019s lawyer has argued the following:\nThere was no legitimate reason for what Manning leaked to have been classified; it was only kept so to avoid US government embarrassment. Which was illegal. To quote Assange: \u201cThe overwhelming majority of information is classified to protect political security, not national security.\u201d\nHyperlink to this section as its own article here.\nThis is the new \u201cHe can leave the embassy whenever he wants.\u201d Except this one\u2019s also being bleated by Trump supporters.\nThe only way to make it feel true for oneself that Assange stands a chance at receiving a fair trial in America is to believe that the US is a just nation with a fair judicial system, especially in the Eastern District of Virginia when trying the cases of people who expose incriminating information about the US war machine. Anyone who believes this has packing foam for brains.\n\u201cNo national security defendant has ever won a case in the EDVA [Eastern District of Virginia],\u201d Kiriakou told RT upon Assange\u2019s arrest. \u201cIn my case, I asked Judge Brinkema to declassify 70 documents that I needed to defend myself. She denied all 70 documents. And so I had literally no defense for myself and was forced to take a plea.\u201d\n\u201cHe will not, he cannot get a fair trial,\u201d Kiriakou said on a Unity4J vigil when Assange was still at the embassy. \u201cIt\u2019s impossible, because the deck is stacked. And everybody knows what\u2019s gonna happen if he comes back to the Eastern District of Virginia. This is the same advice I gave Ed Snowden: don\u2019t come home, because you can\u2019t get a fair trial here. Julian doesn\u2019t have the choice, and that\u2019s what frightens me even more.\u201d\nAssange is indeed being extradited to face trial in the Eastern District of Virginia. Manning herself did not get a fair trial according to her lawyer. Anyone who thinks Assange can expect anything resembling justice upon arrival on US soil has their head in something. Power doesn\u2019t work that way. Grow up.\nNever in my life have I seen so many people so deeply, deeply concerned about the proper adherence to the subtle technicalities of bail protocol as when Sweden dropped its rape investigation, leaving only a bail violation warrant standing between Assange and freedom. All of a sudden I had establishment loyalists telling me how very, very important it is that Assange answer for his horrible, horrible crime of taking political asylum from persecution at the hands of the most violent government on the planet to the mild inconvenience of whoever had to fill out the paperwork.\nThis smear is soundly refuted in this lucid article by Simon Floth, which was endorsed by the Defend Assange Campaign. Floth explains that under British law bail is only breached if there\u2019s a failure to meet bail \u201cwithout reasonable cause\u201d, which the human right to seek asylum certainly is. The UK was so deeply concerned about this bail technicality that it waited a full nine days before issuing an arrest warrant.\nAfter the Swedish government decided to drop its sexual assault investigation without issuing any charges, Assange\u2019s legal team attempted last year to get the warrant dropped. The judge in that case, Emma Arbuthnot, just happens to be married to former Tory junior Defence Minister and government whip James Arbuthnot, who served as director of Security Intelligence Consultancy SC Strategy Ltd with a former head of MI6. Lady Arbuthnot denied Assange\u2019s request with extreme vitriol, despite his argument that British law does have provisions which allow for the time he\u2019d already served under house arrest to count toward far more time than would be served for violating bail. The British government kept police stationed outside the embassy at taxpayers\u2019 expense with orders to arrest Assange on sight.\nThis, like America\u2019s tweaking the law in such a way that allows it to prosecute him for journalism and Ecuador\u2019s tweaking its asylum laws in such a way that allowed it to justify revoking Assange\u2019s asylum, was another way a government tweaked the law in such a way that allowed it to facilitate Assange\u2019s capture and imprisonment. These three governments all tweaked the law in unison in such a way that when looked at individually don\u2019t look totalitarian, but when taken together just so happen to look exactly the same as imprisoning a journalist for publishing inconvenient truths.\nHyperlink to this section as its own article here.\nAssange has been enduring hardships far worse than most people ever have to go through in their lifetime because of his dedication to the lost art of using journalism to hold power to account. If that\u2019s what a narcissist/megalomaniac/jerk looks like to you, then whatever I guess.\nBut really the primary response to this smear is a simple, so what? So what if the guy\u2019s got a personality you don\u2019t like? What the hell does that have to do with anything? What bearing does that have on the fact that a journalist is being prosecuted in a legal agenda which threatens to set a precedent which is destructive to press freedoms around the world?\nSo many of the most common Assange smears boil down to simple ad hominem fallacy, in which the person is attacked because the smearer has no real argument. Pointing out the absence of an actual argument is a more effective weapon against this smear than trying to argue that Assange is a nice person or whatever. Plenty of people say Assange has a pleasant personality, but that\u2019s ultimately got nothing to do with anything. It\u2019s no more material to meaningful discourse than arguing over his physical appearance.\nHyperlink to this section as its own article here.\nI always mentally translate this one into \u201cI\u2019m going to keep advancing the same propaganda narratives which manufactured public consent for Assange\u2019s current predicament... but I don\u2019t want people to see my name on the end result.\u201d\nEven if you hate Assange as a man and as a public figure with every fiber of your being, there is no legitimate reason to turn yourself into a pro bono propagandist for the CIA and the US State Department. If you actually do sincerely oppose his extradition, then you should be responsible with the narratives you choose to circulate about him, because smears kill public support and public demand is what can prevent his extradition. If you\u2019re just pretending to truly oppose his extradition in order to maintain your public wokeness cred and you really just wanted to throw in a few more smears, then you\u2019re a twat.\nWhen looked at in its proper context, what we are witnessing is the slow-motion assassination of Assange via narrative/lawfare, so by couching your support in smears it\u2019s just like you\u2019re helping put a few bullets in the gun but loudly letting everyone know that you hope they shoot the blank.\nHyperlink to this section as its own article here.\nMake no mistake, this is a smear, and it\u2019s just as pernicious as any of the others. People who circulate this hogwash are hurting Assange just as much as the MSNBC mainliners who hate him overtly, even if they claim to support him. At a time when we should all be shaking the earth and demanding freedom for Assange, a certain strain of Trump supporter is going around telling everyone, \u201cRelax, Trump has a plan. Wait and see.\u201d\nI\u2019ve been told to calm down and \u201cwait and see\u201d many times since Assange\u2019s arrest. What \u201cwait and see\u201d really means is \u201cdo nothing.\u201d Don\u2019t do anything. Trust that this same Trump administration which issued an arrest warrant for Assange in December 2017, whose CIA director labeled WikiLeaks a \u201chostile non-state intelligence service\u201d and pledged to destroy it, trust them to do the right thing instead of the wrong thing. Do absolutely nothing in the meantime, and especially don\u2019t help put political pressure on Trump to end Assange\u2019s persecution.\nThis strategy benefits someone, and that someone ain\u2019t Assange.\nPlease stop doing this. If you support Assange, stop doing this. Even if you\u2019re still chugging the Q-laid and still believe the reality TV star who hired John Bolton as his National Security Advisor is actually a brilliant strategist making incomprehensibly complex 8-D chess moves to thwart the Deep State, even if you believe all that, surely you\u2019ll concede that there\u2019s no harm in people pressuring Trump to do the right thing and end the persecution of Assange? If he really is a beneficent wizard, there\u2019d surely be no harm in making a lot of noise telling him he\u2019d better pardon Assange, right? Then why spend your energy running around telling everyone to relax and stop protesting?\nOne argument I keep encountering is that Trump is bringing Assange to America for trial because he can only pardon him after he\u2019s been convicted. This is false. A US president can pardon anyone at any time of any crime against the United States, without their having been convicted and without their even having been charged. After leaving office Richard Nixon was issued a full presidential pardon by Gerald Ford for \u201call offenses against the United States which he, Richard Nixon, has committed or may have committed or taken part in during the period from January 20, 1969 through August 9,1974.\u201d Nixon had never been charged with anything. If Trump were going to pardon Assange he could have done it at any time since taking office, instead of issuing a warrant for his arrest in December 2017 and executing it on Thursday after a series of international legal manipulations. A pardon is not in the plans.\nAnother common belief I keep encountering is that Trump is bringing Assange to America to get him to testify about his source for the 2016 Democratic Party emails in exchange for a pardon, thereby revealing the truth about Russiagate\u2019s origins and bringing down Clinton and Obama. This is false. Everyone who knows anything about Assange (including the Trump administration) knows that he will never, ever reveal a source under any circumstances whatsoever. It would be a cardinal journalistic sin, a violation of every promise WikiLeaks has ever made, and a betrayal of his entire life\u2019s work. More importantly, imprisoning a journalist and threatening him with a heavy sentence to coerce him into giving up information against his will is evil.\nBut that isn\u2019t what Trump is doing. Trump is pursuing the imprisonment of a journalist for exposing US war crimes, so that he can scare off future leak publishers and set a legal precedent for their prosecution.\nHyperlink to this section as its own article here.\nOf all the Assange smears I\u2019ve encountered, I think this one best epitomizes the entire overarching establishment narrative churn on the subject. Like the rest of the smear campaign, it\u2019s a completely unsubstantiated claim designed not to advance a logical argument about the current facts of Assange\u2019s situation but to provoke disgust and revulsion towards him, so that when you think of Julian Assange you don\u2019t think about press freedoms and government transparency, you think about poo. In a way it\u2019s actually more honest than some of the other smears, just because it\u2019s so obvious about what it is and what it\u2019s trying to do.\nPeople who advance this smear are literally always acting in very bad faith. As of this writing I\u2019ve never even bothered trying to engage anyone in debate on the matter, because they\u2019re too gross and too internally tormented to make interacting with them anything but unpleasant, so I have no advice to give on how to argue with such creatures. Personally I just block them.\nThere is no reason to believe that this smear is true (his lawyer flatly denies it), and the Ecuadorian government would have had every incentive to lie in order to try and justify its revocation of asylum which WikiLeaks says is \u201cin violation of international law.\u201d However, it\u2019s worth taking a minute to consider the fact that if this smear were true, the people running around mocking Assange and making poop jokes about him on social media today would be even more depraved. Because what would it mean if Assange really were spreading feces on the wall? It would mean that he\u2019d cracked under the pressure of his embassy imprisonment and lost his mind. Which would mean that these people are running around mocking a man who\u2019s been driven to psychosis by his abusive circumstances. Which would be despicable.\nHyperlink to this section as its own article here.\nIt\u2019s amazing how many mainstream media publications have thought it newsworthy to write articles about Assange\u2019s body odor. Try advocating for him on any public forum, however, and you\u2019ll immediately understand the intention behind this smear. Try to argue against the extradition of a journalist for publishing inconvenient facts about the powerful, and you\u2019ll be swarmed by people making scoffing comments about how stinky and disgusting he is. As though that has anything to do with anything whatsoever.\nFor the record, people who visit Assange commonly report that he\u2019s clean and smells normal, but that\u2019s really beside the point. Trying to turn a discussion about a journalist who is being prosecuted by the US empire for publishing truth into a discussion about personal hygiene is despicable, and anyone who does it should feel bad.\nHyperlink to this section as its own article here.\nWhat he actually was was a target of the US war machine. The \u201cbad houseguest\u201d narrative serves only to distract from Ecuador\u2019s role in turning Assange over to the Metropolitan police instead of holding to the reasons it granted Assange asylum in the first place, and to seed disgust as in Smear 11 and Smear 12.\nWhat actually happened was that Ecuador\u2019s new president Lenin Moreno quickly found himself being courted by the US government after taking office, meeting with Vice President Mike Pence and reportedly discussing Assange after US Democratic senators petitioned Pence to push for Moreno to revoke political asylum. The New York Times reported last year that in 2017 Trump\u2019s sleazy goon Paul Manafort met with Moreno and offered to broker a deal where Ecuador could receive debt relief aid in exchange for handing Assange over, and just last month Ecuador ended up receiving a 4.2 billion dollar loan from the Washington-based IMF. And then, lo and behold, we just so happen to see Ecuador justifying the revocation of political asylum under the absurd claim that Assange had violated conditions that were only recently invented, using narratives that were based on wild distortions and outright lies.\nNo he didn\u2019t. The email exchanges between Donald Trump Jr and the WikiLeaks Twitter account reveal nothing other than two parties trying to extract favors from each other, unsuccessfully. Here\u2019s what the WikiLeaks account sent:\nThe password to the website is getting a lot of attention as of this writing since the release of the Mueller report, with Slate going so far as to argue that Don Jr may be guilty of violating \u201cthe Computer Fraud and Abuse Act, which makes it illegal to access a computer using a stolen password without authorization\u201d since he did use the password. This is nonsense. WikiLeaks didn\u2019t send Trump a password which enabled him to \u201caccess a computer\u201d, or do anything other than preview a website that was actively being publicized and viewed by many people using the same password.\nThe password WikiLeaks gave him was a press pass to preview a Russiagate website which was about to launch. Here\u2019s a hyperlink to an archive of a (now missing) article which discussed the website\u2019s launch at the time. The article shares an email that was being passed around clearly showing that many people were being invited to look at the site in the hopes that they\u2019d write articles promoting it. The picture that\u2019s being painted of WikiLeaks hacking into the back end of a website is completely inaccurate; there was a password to preview a website whose owners wanted people to look at it, lots of people had that password, and one of them reportedly gave it to WikiLeaks.\nBeyond that, what is there? WikiLeaks trying unsuccessfully to get Don Jr to advance its agendas like giving them Trump\u2019s tax return (i.e. soliciting a potential source for leaks), challenging America\u2019s broken electoral system, trying to get more eyes on their material, and a Hail Mary suggestion that the Trump administration shake things up by making Assange the Australian ambassador with a full acknowledgement that this will never happen. None of these things occurred, and WikiLeaks never responded to Don Jr\u2019s request for information about an upcoming leak drop.\nAssange has agendas. Whoop dee doo. I have agendas too, otherwise I wouldn\u2019t be doing this. All journalists have agendas, it just happens that most of them have the agenda to become rich and famous by any means necessary, which generally means cozying up to the rulers of the establishment and manufacturing consent for the status quo. Assange\u2019s agenda is infinitely more noble and infinitely more reviled by the servants of power: to upset the status quo that demands war, corruption and oppression in order to exist. His communications with Don Jr are geared toward this end, as is the rest of his life\u2019s work.\nThis is just wrong and stupid. Do thirty seconds of research for God\u2019s sake.\nYes, yes, we all know by now that everyone who opposes the imperial war machine in any way is both a Russian agent and an antisemite. Jeremy Corbyn knows it, Ilhan Omar knows it, we all know it.\nThis one\u2019s been around a while, ever since headlines blared in 2011 that Assange had complained of a \u201cJewish conspiracy\u201d against him after an account of a conversation by Private Eye editor Ian Hislop. Assange responded to this claim as follows:\n\u201cWe treasure our strong Jewish support and staff.\u201d Man, what a Nazi.\nBut that wasn\u2019t what cemented this smear into public consciousness. Two related events punched that ticket, and bear with me here:\nThe first event was the WikiLeaks account tweeting and then quickly deleting the following in July 2016: \u201cTribalist symbol for establishment climbers? Most of our critics have 3 (((brackets around their names))) & have black-rim glasses. Bizarre.\u201d The triple brackets are what\u2019s known as echoes, which are a symbol that antisemites often put around words and names to hatefully indicate Jewishness in online discourse. In 2016 some Jewish people began putting the triple brackets around their own names on social media as a way of pushing back against this behavior, so if you really want to it\u2019s possible for you to interpret the tweet as saying \u2018All our critics are Jewish. Bizarre.\u2019\nBut does that make sense? Does it make sense for the guy who announced \u201cWe treasure our strong Jewish support and staff\u201d to then go making openly antisemitic comments? And if he really did suddenly decide to let the world know that he believes there\u2019s a Jewish conspiracy against WikiLeaks, why would he delete it? What\u2019s the theory there? That he was like \u201cOh, I just wanted to let everyone know about my Jewish conspiracy theory, but it turns out people get offended when an account with millions of followers says things like that\u201d? That makes no sense.\nIf you look at the account\u2019s other tweets at the time, it becomes clear that its operator was actually just trying to communicate an obscure, subtle point that was completely unsuitable for a massive international audience and 140 characters. When a user responded to the tweet before it was deleted explaining that some Jewish people now put triple brackets around their names to push back against antisemitism, the account responded, \u201cYes, but it seems to have been repurposed for something else entirely \u2014 a wanna be establishment in-group designator.\u201d When accused of antisemitism by another account, WikiLeaks responded, \u201cThe opposite. We criticised the misappropriation of anti-Nazi critiques by social climbers. Like Ice Bucket Challenge & ALS.\u201d\nIt looks clear to me that whoever was running the WikiLeaks Twitter account that day was clumsily trying to communicate an overly complicated idea about \u201csocial climbers\u201d and establishment loyalism, then deleted the tweet when they realized they\u2019d screwed up and stumbled into a social media land mine.\nNow, I say \u201cwhoever was running the WikiLeaks Twitter account that day\u201d because it\u2019s been public knowledge for years that @WikiLeaks is a staff account shared by multiple people. Here\u2019s a tweet of the account saying \u201cthis is a staff account, not Assange.\u201d Here\u2019s a tweet of the account saying \u201c@WikiLeaks is a shared staff account.\u201d This became self-evidently true for all to see when Assange\u2019s internet access was cut off by the Ecuadorian embassy for the first time in October 2016, but the WikiLeaks Twitter account kept making posts during that time without interruption. This takes us to the second event which helped cement the antisemitism smear.\nThe second event occurred in February 2018 when The Intercept\u2019s Micah Lee, who has had a personal beef with WikiLeaks and Assange for years, published a ghastly article which made the following assertion:\nThere is absolutely no reason for Lee to have made this assumption, and the fact that this remains uncorrected in his original article is journalistic malpractice.\nThe article reveals Twitter DMs from a group chat of which the WikiLeaks account was a member. One of the other accounts in the group chat shared a tweet by journalist Raphael Satter, who was posting a smear piece he\u2019d written about WikiLeaks. The WikiLeaks account responded as follows:\nWhen I first read about this exchange as written down by Micah Lee, I read it as \u201cHe\u2019s always been a rat, but then, he is Jewish, and engaged with the ((())) issue.\u201d Which would of course be gross. Calling someone a rat because they\u2019re Jewish would obviously be antisemitic. But if you read the DMs, whoever was running the account didn\u2019t do that; they said \u201cHe\u2019s always ben a rat,\u201d followed by a full stop, then beginning a new thought.\nNow if you look at the date on that exchange and compare it to the date on the deleted ((())) tweet, you\u2019ll see that this was one month after the infamous ((())) tweet that had caused such a tizzy. It appears likely to me that the operator of the account (who again could have been any of the WikiLeaks staff who had access to it) was saying that Satter was mad about \u201cthe ((())) issue\u201d, meaning the tweet so many people were so recently enraged about and were still discussing, hence his attacking them with a smear piece.\nThere are also claims about an association between Assange and the controversial Israel Shamir, which WikiLeaks denies unequivocally, saying in a statement:\nNow, we\u2019re on Smear #16. There\u2019s still a ways to go. If you\u2019ve been reading this article straight through it should be obvious to you by now that there\u2019s a campaign to paint Assange as literally the worst person in the world by calling him all the worst things you can possibly call someone. Is it possible that he\u2019s some kind of secret Jew hater? Sure, theoretically, but there\u2019s certainly no good argument to be made for that based on the facts at hand, and given the extent the narrative shapers are going to to paint him in a negative light, it\u2019s a mighty big stretch in my opinion.\nUnlike most Assange smears this one is more common on the political left than the center, and it totally baffles me. Demanding that governments be transparent and powerful people held to account is not at all compatible with fascism. In fact, it\u2019s the exact opposite.\nItalian investigative journalist and longtime WikiLeaks collaborator Stephania Maurizi told Micah Lee the following on Twitter last year:\nI really don\u2019t know how people make this one work in their minds. \u201cYou guys know who the real fascist is? It\u2019s the guy who\u2019s locked behind bars by the most violent and oppressive government on the planet for standing up against the war crimes of that government.\u201d I mean, come on.\nWhen I question what\u2019s behind this belief I get variations on Smear 18 and Smear 22, and the occasional reference to one odd tweet about birth rates and changing demographics that could look like a white nationalist talking point if you squint at it just right and ignore the fact that it appears on its own surrounded by a total absence of anything resembling a white nationalist worldview, and ignore the tweet immediately following it criticizing \u201cemotional imperialism\u201d and the theft of caregivers from less powerful nations. You have to connect a whole lot of dots with a whole lot of imaginary red yarn and ignore a huge mountain of evidence to the contrary in order to believe that Assange is a fascist.\nNo he wasn\u2019t. He hated Hillary \u201cCan\u2019t we just drone this guy?\u201d Clinton for her horrible record and her efforts as Secretary of State to shut down WikiLeaks, but that\u2019s not the same as supporting Trump. His hatred of Clinton was personal, responding to a complaint by a lead Clinton staffer about his role in her defeat with the words \u201cNext time, don\u2019t imprison and kill my friends, deprive my children of their father, corrupt judicial processes, bully allies into doing the same, and run a seven year unconstitutional grand jury against me and my staff.\u201d\nAnd he wanted her to lose. Desiring the loss of the woman who campaigned on a promise to create a no-fly zone in the same region that Russian military planes were conducting operations is perfectly reasonable for someone with Assange\u2019s worldview, and it doesn\u2019t mean he wanted Trump to be president or believed he\u2019d make a good one. Preferring to be stabbed over shot doesn\u2019t mean you want to be stabbed.\nIn July 2016 Assange compared the choice between Clinton and Trump to a choice between cholera and gonorrhea, saying, \u201cPersonally, I would prefer neither.\u201d When a Twitter user suggested to Assange in 2017 that he start sucking up to Trump in order to secure a pardon, Assange replied, \u201cI\u2019d rather eat my own intestines.\u201d Could not possibly be more unequivocal.\nAssange saw Trump as clearly as anyone at the time, and now he\u2019s behind bars at the behest of that depraved administration. Clinton voters still haven\u2019t found a way to make this work in their minds; they need to hate Assange because he helped Hillary lose, but when they cheerlead for his arrest they\u2019re cheering for a Trump administration agenda. These same people who claim to oppose Trump and support the free press are cheerleading for a Trump administration agenda which constitutes the greatest threat to the free press we\u2019ve seen in our lifetimes. When I encounter them online I\u2019ve taken to photoshopping a MAGA hat onto their profile pics.\nAssange has never been a Trump supporter. But, in a very real way, those who support his imprisonment are.\nThat\u2019s just you admitting that you have no values beyond blind partisan loyalty. Only liking truth when it serves you is the same as hating truth.\nNo he doesn\u2019t. There\u2019s no evidence anywhere that WikiLeaks helped cause anyone\u2019s death anywhere in the world. This smear has been enjoying renewed popularity since it became public knowledge that he\u2019s being prosecuted for the Manning leaks, the argument being that the leaks got US troops killed.\nThis argument is stupid. In 2013 the Pentagon, who had every incentive to dig up evidence that WikiLeaks had gotten people killed, ruled that no such instances have been discovered.\nNo he didn\u2019t. The WikiLeaks website reports the following:\nThat \u201csomeone else\u201d was Emma Best, then known as Michael Best, who also happens to be the one who published the controversial Twitter DMs used in Micah Lee\u2019s aforementioned Assange smear piece. Best wrote an article clarifying that the information about Turkish women was published not by WikiLeaks, but by her.\nNo he didn\u2019t. In 2013 Australia\u2019s WikiLeaks Party ended up inadvertently giving preferential votes to right-wing parties in New South Wales as a result of an administrative error.\nIn 2012, WikiLeaks announced on Twitter that Assange was running for the Australian senate, and in 2013 the WikiLeaks Party was formally registered with the Australian Electoral Commission and fielded candidates in the states of Victoria, New South Wales and Western Australia. The other candidates in the party included a human rights lawyer, an ethicist, a former Greens candidate, a former diplomat, a law professor and a former president of the Ethnic Communities council in WA. It was a very left-wing offering with unusual political ads.\nIn Australia we have preferential voting, which is also known in the US as ranked-choice voting. You are given two ballots, a small one for the house of representatives and an arm\u2019s-length one for the senate, which you number the candidates in order of your preference, number one being your first preference. Voting for the senate is an epic task so you are given the ability to number every single candidate in order of preference (which is called \u201cvoting below the line\u201d), or back in 2013 you could simply nominate the party who you want to win \u201cabove the line\u201d and if they were knocked out in the first round, their preferences were applied to your vote.\nThese preferences make up what\u2019s called a \u201cHow To Vote\u201d card. Have a look at an example here. It\u2019s a pamphlet given to voters on the day that suggests how to number your preferences to support your party, but it\u2019s also submitted to the electoral commission so that they can assign your chosen flow of preferences in the senate vote.\nEvery election there is a shit-storm over the How To Vote cards as parties bargain with each other and play each other off to try and get the flow of preferences to go their way. To make things even more complex, you have to create these cards for every state and seat you are putting up candidates for. The WikiLeaks Party preferences statement in one of the states, New South Wales, somehow wound up having two right wing parties preferenced before the three major parties. The WikiLeaks Party said it was an administrative error and issued this statement in August 2013:\nSo, in short, the entirety of the WikiLeaks Party gathered and voted to put those right wing parties down the ballot below Greens, Labor and Liberal parties but someone fucked up the form. All How To Vote cards are public and heavily scrutinized so there was never any suggestion that the WL Party had tried to get away with something on the sly, just that they had made a monumental fuckup. The WikiLeaks Party ended up getting 0.66 percent of the vote and in NSW those preferences went to those right wing parties who also failed to get the numbers required to win a seat. Was there mismanagement? Yes. Was it deliberate? There\u2019s no reason to believe that it was.\nThis was all happening at the same time Chelsea Manning\u2019s case was wrapping up and Assange was busy helping Edward Snowden.\n\u201cI made a decision two months ago to spend a lot of my time on dealing with the Edward Snowden asylum situation, and trying to save the life of a young man,\u201d Assange told Australian TV at the time. \u201cThe result is over-delegation. I admit and I accept full responsibility for over-delegating functions to the Australian party while I try to take care of that situation.\u201d\nNo he didn\u2019t. The Saudi Cables were KSA government documents, i.e. information the government already had, so there was no danger of legal retaliation based on Saudi Arabia\u2019s laws against homosexuality. There is no evidence that anyone was ever endangered by the Saudi cables.\nThis smear was sparked by the aforementioned Raphael Satter at AP, whose executives WikiLeaks sent a formal complaint breaking down Satter\u2019s journalistic misconduct and requesting the publication of its response.\nThe WikiLeaks website explains:\n\u201cMr. Satter\u2019s article has itself highlighted specific private information which can be searched for on the internet, and which is available independently of the Wikileaks site (as Mr. Satter should know, the content of the Saudi Cables was published online before Wikileaks collated it as the \u2018Saudi Cables\u2019),\u201d the WikiLeaks complaint to AP noted.\nI\u2019m probably going to have to revisit this one because it\u2019s so all over the place that it\u2019s hard for me to even say exactly what it is. It only exists in fringey conspiracy circles, so there\u2019s no organized thought around it and when I ask people why they\u2019re so sure Assange is a CIA/Mossad agent/asset I get a bunch of different answers, many of them contradictory and none of them comprised of linear, complete thoughts. Mostly I just get an answer that goes something like \u201cWell he spent some time in Egypt and he criticized 9/11 truthers, and he\u2019s a few degrees of separation from this one shady person, so, you know, you connect the dots.\u201d\nNo, you connect the dots. You\u2019re the one making the claim.\nNone of them ever do.\nYou\u2019d think this smear would have subsided since Assange was imprisoned at the behest of the US government, but I\u2019m actually encountering it way more often now. Every day I\u2019m getting conspiracy types telling me Assange isn\u2019t what I think he is, right at the time when the MSM has converged to smear him with more aggression than ever before and right when he needs support more than ever.\nI\u2019ve never encountered anyone who can present a convincing (or even coherent) argument that Assange is working for any intelligence agency, so I generally just declare the burden of proof unmet and move on. If there\u2019s anyone out there who believes this and would like to take a stab at proving their claim, I have a few questions for you:\nWhy is a CIA/Mossad agent/asset/limited hangout/whatever being rewarded for his loyal service with a stay in Belmarsh Prison awaiting US extradition? How does that work, specifically? Are you claiming that he was an asset that got \u201cburned\u201d? If so, when did this happen? Was he still an asset while he was languishing in the embassy in failing health and chronic pain? Or was it before then? His persecution began in 2010 and the US government was working on sabotaging him back in 2008, so are you claiming he hasn\u2019t been on their side since then? And if you\u2019re claiming that he used to be an asset but got burned, why are you spending your energy running around telling people on the internet he\u2019s an asset when he isn\u2019t one anymore, and now his prosecution threatens press freedoms everywhere? If you oppose his extradition, why are you engaged in this behavior? Are you just interrupting an adult conversation that grownups are trying to have about an urgent matter, or is it something else? Did you run around telling everyone that Saddam used to be a CIA asset instead of protesting the Iraq invasion? Or do you believe this whole US prosecution is fake? If so, what is Assange getting out of it? What\u2019s incentivizing him to comply at this point? What specifically is your claim about what\u2019s happening?\nMy past experiences when engaging these types tells me not to expect any solid and thorough answers to my questions.\nI\u2019ve been at this commentary gig for about two and a half years, and during that time I\u2019ve had people show up in my inbox and social media notifications warning me that everyone in anti-establishment circles is a CIA limited hangout. Literally everyone; you name a high-profile anti-establishment figure, and at one time or another I\u2019ve received warnings from people that they are actually controlled opposition for a government agency.\nThis happens because for some people, paranoia is their only compass. They wind up in the same circles as WikiLeaks supporters because the lens of paranoia through which they perceive the world causes them to distrust the same power establishment and mass media that WikiLeaks supporters distrust, but beyond that the two groups are actually quite different. That same paranoia which causes them to view all the wrongdoers with suspicion causes them to view everyone else with suspicion as well.\nParanoia happens for a number of reasons, one of them being that people who aren\u2019t clear on the reasons our society acts so crazy will start making up reasons, like the belief that everyone with a high profile is a covert CIA agent. If you can\u2019t see clearly what\u2019s going on you start making things up, which can cause paranoia to become your only guidance system.\nThere\u2019s just no limit to the garbage these smear merchants will cook up. Concern for the embassy cat picked up when the Moreno government began cooking up excuses to oust Assange from the embassy, the most highly publicized of them being a demand that he clean up after his cat. From that point on the narrative became that not only is Assange a stinky Nazi rapist Russian spy who smears poo on the walls... he also mistreats his cat. Ridiculous.\nA bunch of \u201cWhere is Assange\u2019s cat??\u201d news stories emerged after his arrest, because that\u2019s where people\u2019s minds go when a civilization-threatening lawfare agenda is being carried out. The Guardian\u2019s James Ball, who last year authored an article humiliatingly arguing that the US will never try to extradite Assange titled \u201cThe only barrier to Julian Assange leaving Ecuador\u2019s embassy is pride\u201d, told his Twitter followers, \u201cFor the record: Julian Assange\u2019s cat was reportedly given to a shelter by the Ecuadorian embassy ages ago, so don\u2019t expect a feline extradition in the next few hours. (I genuinely offered to adopt it).\u201d\nAssange\u2019s cat is fine. It wasn\u2019t given to a \u201cshelter\u201d; the WikiLeaks Twitter account posted a video of the cat watching Assange\u2019s arrest on TV with the caption, \u201cWe can confirm that Assange\u2019s cat is safe. Assange asked his lawyers to rescue him from embassy threats in mid-October. They will be reunited in freedom.\u201d\nYes, of course they tried this one too, and I still run into people online from time to time who regurgitate it. CNN has had on guests who asserted that Assange is a pedophile, not once but twice. In January 2017 former CIA official Phil Mudd said live on air that Assange is \u201ca pedophile who lives in the Ecuadorean Embassy in London,\u201d and instead of correcting him on the spot CNN did nothing and shared the video on Twitter, leaving the tweet up until WikiLeaks threatened to sue. On what appears to have been right around the same day, Congressman Mike Rogers claimed on CNN that Assange \u201cis wanted for rape of a minor.\u201d\nThese claims are of course false, designed to paint Assange as literally the worst person in the world with all the very worst qualities you can imagine in a human being.\nThese claims came months after an alarming narrative control operation working behind the bogus dating website toddandclare.com persuaded a UN body called the Global Compact to grant it status as a participant, then used its platform to publicly accuse Assange, with whom it was communicating, of \u201cpedophile crimes\u201d. McClatchy reports the following:\nSo that\u2019s a thing.\nI\u2019m just going to toss this one here at the end because I\u2019m seeing it go around a lot in the wake of the Mueller report.\nRobert Mueller, who helped the Bush administration deceive the world about WMD in Iraq, has claimed that the GRU was the source of WikiLeaks\u2019 2016 drops, and claimed in his report that WikiLeaks deceived its audience by implying that its source was the murdered DNC staffer Seth Rich. This claim is unsubstantiated because, as we discussed in Smear 4, the public has not seen a shred of evidence proving who was or was not WikiLeaks\u2019 source, so there\u2019s no way to know there was any deception happening there. We\u2019ve never seen any hard proof, nor indeed anything besides official narrative, connecting the Russian government to Guccifer 2.0 and Guccifer 2.0 to WikiLeaks, and Daniel Lazare for Consortium News documents that there are in fact some major plot holes in Mueller\u2019s timeline. Longtime Assange friend and WikiLeaks ally Craig Murray maintains that he knows the source of the DNC Leaks and Podesta Emails were two different Americans, not Russians, and hints that one of them was a DNC insider. There is exactly as much publicly available evidence for Murray\u2019s claim as there is for Mueller\u2019s.\nMainstream media has been blaring day after day for years that it is an absolute known fact that the Russian government was WikiLeaks\u2019 source, and the only reason people scoff and roll their eyes at anyone who makes the indisputably factual claim that we\u2019ve seen no evidence for this is because the illusory truth effect causes the human brain to mistake repetition for fact.\nThe smear is that Assange knew his source was actually the Russian government, and he implied it was Seth Rich to throw people off the scent. Mueller asserted that something happened, and it\u2019s interpreted as hard fact instead of assertion. There\u2019s no evidence for any of this, and there\u2019s no reason to go believing the WMD guy on faith about a narrative which incriminates yet another government which refuses to obey the dictates of the US empire.\nAnd I guess that\u2019s it for now. Again, this article is an ongoing project, so I\u2019ll be updating it and adding to it regularly as new information comes in and new smears need refutation. If I missed something or got something wrong, or even if you spotted a typo, please email me at admin@caitlinjohnstone.com and let me know. I\u2019m trying to create the best possible tool for people to refute Assange smears, so I\u2019ll keep sharpening this baby to make sure it cuts like a razor.

My name is David Siegel. I\u2019ve written this essay to help young people in today\u2019s society use the scientific method to understand the world and fix it. The world is complex, yet our minds tell us otherwise, making us overconfident and often wrong. In reality, cause and effect are difficult to determine. If you want to truly fix the world \u2014 and I assume that\u2019s why you\u2019re here \u2014 it would probably help if you understood what the problems are before trying to solve them.

Let\u2019s start with the story of money, a mysterious topic to most of us. Niall Ferguson made a fantastic book and stunning documentary called The Ascent of Money. It was widely praised and viewed. The only problem is that he was mostly wrong. His narrative promoted many myths and beliefs about money that don\u2019t fit the evidence available (I explore them below). In reality, most of our \u201ccommon wisdom\u201d fits the stories but not the facts.\nHumans learn best through stories, so the best storytellers own the market in understanding the world, but they are usually the wrong people to understand a problem in the first place. Those who write books and give talks onstage are contest winners and storytellers, not statisticians and scientists.\nWe\u2019ve been taking the blue pill all our lives, and now I\u2019m going to hand you the red pill and show you how deep the rabbit hole goes. Let\u2019s look at two quick topics and bring them into the light of reality.\nThere are thousands of people with nutrition PhDs. Almost all of them are based on very poor research, bad statistical analysis, conclusions that contradict each other, and rigorous nonsense.\nThe common conception that your weight equals calories in minus calories out was disproven decades ago* by several well designed studies. What is driving the obesity epidemic? Is it sugar? Carbohydrates? Fat? Portions? Lack of sleep? Fast food? Depression? Genetics?\nIn reality, we simply don\u2019t know. (I\u2019d write a book called What we Don\u2019t Know about Nutrition, but a) it would be huge, and b) no one would buy it.) Most people believe they have a nutritional mental model that fits reality, but it is based on stories not evidence. (Much more on this below.)\nA good way to see the storytelling effect is to look at the \u201ccommon wisdom\u201d of the Great Financial Crisis of 2008/9, an event that impacted every person on earth and destroyed a billion jobs. Almost everyone got the story wrong. Michael Lewis\u2019s book and movie, The Big Short, was popular but completely missed the true cause and effect. So did Niall Ferguson and many experts.\nIn reality, two people \u2014 Kevin Erdmann, an investor and Scott Sumner, an economist \u2014 have shown that the \u201ccommon wisdom\u201d does not fit the facts. Using the scientific method and hard evidence, they show that the GFC was a result of bad reactions to scarce resources. It happened in four phases:\nThough the Great Financial Crisis is the defining event for an entire generation (Millennials), this story hasn\u2019t been told, and most people are confused about the true cause. The data does not support the common narrative, and that narrative still has a strong effect on policy and politics today. If we don\u2019t understand the mistakes of the past, we are bound to repeat them (in fact, we may be about to repeat them).\nIf we were designing governments, institutions, and markets from scratch, we wouldn\u2019t incorporate most of what we have today (though I would want to keep Trader Joe\u2019s). By taking a fresh look, we can imagine building a much better world for the 21st century.\nBELIEF SYSTEMS COME IN CONVENIENT, PRE-DEFINED PACKAGES, saving us the hassle of having to construct them. Here are several. You may disagree with my categories, you may have your own list, but the point is the same:\nFundamentalist: The church is the state. Literal interpretation of ancient texts, preservation of hierarchy, rules, prayer, and tradition. Jerry Falwell.\nConspiracy: Suspect the deep state and military industrial complex, paranoia, survivalism, gun ownership, tax evasion, etc. Oliver Stone.\nAnarchy: Individualism. Marginalism. Let markets decide. Murray Rothbard.\nConservative: Small government, big defense industries, tradition, personal property rights, business-centric, religious values, closed borders, police enforcement, free trade, pro-life, gun ownership. Margaret Thatcher.\nFascism: The state is everything. No individual rights. Faith in \u201cwise men\u201d who run the state machinery. Dogma and propaganda, no free press. Donald Trump (slightly tongue-in-cheek).\nLibertarian: Individual rights, non-aggression, property rights, autonomy, minimal state intervention, free press, free speech, free trade. Ron Paul.\nLiberal: liberty, civil rights, secularism, free speech, social programs to support the poor, pro-choice, pro gun control, more equal distribution of wealth, unions, global warming, environmental issues. Noam Chomsky.\nNeoliberal: Free markets, private enterprise, reduced government, less regulation, more competition. Ronald Reagan.\nProgressive: Similar to liberal but with social and government reform. Less about unions and more about economic freedom. Bill Clinton.\nGreen: Environmentalism, global warming, social justice, secularism. At its most extreme, humans are seen as \u201cthe enemy of nature.\u201d Jill Stein.\nChristian democrat: social conservatism combined with market liberalism, fair competition, preservation of religious values. Angela Merkel.\nReligious: power of god to control destiny, power of prayer, combination of church and state, pro-life, biblical beliefs over science. Rick Santorum.\nPopulist: majority rule, often nationalist, often anti-elite, often against free-trade. Donald Trump.\nSocialist: collective ownership, equality, government-designed stability. Bernie Sanders.\nSpiritual: magical thinking, supreme beings, hidden causes, peace, calm, kindness, \u201ceverything happens for a reason,\u201d emotional. Mahatma Gandhi.\nMinimalist: Less is more, fewer possessions, not voting is a choice, simplification, \u201cdo no harm.\u201d [There are no famous minimalists.]\n\u201cWhole Earth:\u201d Peace, global warming, whole grains, naturopaths, tea, herbs, organic, unshaven, balance of humans and nature. James Lovelock.\nSkeptics: Skeptical empiricism, assuming that most claims are false, \u201cextraordinary claims require extraordinary evidence.\u201d Skeptics are negative on most future projections but, as a tribe, they have inexplicably embraced model predictions of catastrophic climate change. Michael Shermer.\nRationalist: Scientific method, Bayesian reasoning, evidence-based decisionmaking, randomly controlled trials, observe your own biases, change your view when you see new evidence, neutral. Eliezer Yudkowsky.\nThese platforms are so well entrenched that most people choose a party and accept \u201cthe good with the bad.\u201d Membership is part of their identity. A challenge to one of the beliefs of the platform is a challenge to the existence and well-being of the tribe. Tribe members must defend the entire platform \u2014 even if they suspect or know parts of it are wrong.\nSomeone who is a vegan atheist fiscal-conservative pro-abortion free trader who cares about the environment, supports government reform, supports gun control but not banking regulation, is skeptical about forecasts of catastrophic climate change, and supports the basic concept of income redistribution has no tribe, no allies, nowhere to call home. Most of us believe in a combination of our own \u201ctruths.\u201d We go along with beliefs we really don\u2019t support because changing tribes has a high social cost (unless you are Donald Trump).\nMost groups are spearheaded by a small number of extremists fighting for the existence, identity, and leadership of their tribe. They are not allowed to question the platform. A huge amount of what you read comes from zealous authors who are not representative of the wider group. While this may be the only way to get a new group started, it may not be the best way to govern.\nMy goal is to help people decide for themselves. If you are ready to understand the world on a case-by-case basis; if you are willing to change your mind when you see new evidence and put in the work to challenge your own conclusions, you should keep reading. Please read this with your mind open to learning rather than defending your existing views. I changed my mind about several topics as I did the research for this project. Instructions for correcting me are at the end.\nBELOW ARE 150 QUESTIONS AND SHORT DISCUSSIONS WITH LINKS TO RESEARCH. They are not meant as short-cuts or my \u201copinion,\u201d but rather as launching points for your own research. The links are more important than the text. Feel free to skip to the section that interests you, the questions are in no particular order. Here are the categories again:\nNOTE: I am a rationalist. I feel most at home in the rationalist tribe. Rationalists generally see things in a similar way, and we are happy to change our minds when we see new evidence that points in a new direction. When we disagree about something, we never \u201cagree to disagree.\u201d* Instead, we define a suitable test and make a friendly bet on the outcome. Whoever loses is happy to give up the money in exchange for a more accurate view of the world.\nDISCLAIMER! This is not investing, health, legal, or policy advice. I give a lot of recommendations here. Some may be wrong (or wrong for you). You are responsible for your own actions and outcomes.\nCHALLENGE: If you would like to try answering yourself before you see my research, I have created a question page \u2014 you can print it and work out your answers first, then come back here and compare with mine.\nShould we use GDP as a measure of a society\u2019s happiness and prosperity? It\u2019s not perfect. But if we strive to maximize long-term, sustainable economic growth (measured by GDP), billions of people will be better off. In fact, it\u2019s such a good indicator that I argue it\u2019s better for most government agencies to simply focus on this one number rather than what they are doing now. If we can steadily grow GDP, we automatically improve a lot of humanitarian, well-being, societal, and environmental indicators, as we have seen in the past 40 years. Then, we would also want to factor in various externalities, so at some point we should look at using a better measure than GDP.\nWhat is monetary policy? Central banks determine how much money is in circulation and often the inter-bank lending rate of interest. They are one hundred percent responsible for long-term inflation, and they are mostly responsible for recessions. I believe central bankers have more impact on our lives than presidents do. While most of the world has had several serious recessions, Australia hasn\u2019t had one in almost 30 years. Most economies operate optimally at a rate of about 2 percent inflation, yet central bankers are still responsible for most recessions. Today\u2019s policies are based on models that mostly haven\u2019t worked. We can and should fix monetary policy.*\nHow can we fix monetary policy? If you don\u2019t happen to like recessions, those of us who live in the US and UK can try to convince our central banks to implement NGDP level targeting, a policy proposal by Scott Sumner.* To improve lives of its citizens, the Fed should automate monetary policy informed by robust prediction markets and driven by continual adjustment of the money supply according to a formula based on the market predictions. The Fed should abandon control of interest rates and let the Treasury handle the balance sheet. Citizens should have electronic accounts with the central bank directly. This is called Central Bank Digital Currency (CBDC) \u2014 something many central banks are looking into (but not doing). The Bank of England should consider something similar. In this video, I explain NGDP level targeting:\nWhat caused the Great Depression? It wasn\u2019t consumer confidence, it wasn\u2019t a banking failure, it was the gold standard. Gold hoarding caused deflation until Roosevelt revalued the dollar and made it illegal for US citizens to own gold in 1933. This is a fascinating story that mostly hasn\u2019t been told but is only of interest to those who study economics.\nWhat causes financial bubbles? I don\u2019t believe they exist. They are a story told in reverse after a shock. Most \u201cbubbles\u201d \u2014 from the Dutch Tulipmania* to the Great Depression to the housing bubble \u2014 are very poorly understood by experts and the general public. Cause and effect is a story told in reverse but rarely applies again. In reasonably liquid markets, prices accurately reflect the market\u2019s assessment of upside and downside . If traders could easily short (bet against the rise of) any asset, that would make markets even more efficient.\nDoes market regulation work? In general, regulation rarely achieves the stated result. The finance industry is a particularly good example. In reality, financial regulations are remarkably ineffective at catching \u201ccriminals,\u201d yet since 2008 regulated banks have been fined more than $243 billion for committing fraud. Since 2000, Wells Fargo has been fined 93 times for committing bank fraud. Anti-Money Laundering laws don\u2019t work, yet politicians can\u2019t admit that. Who launders money? Banks do: 18 out of the top 20 banks in Europe have been fined for violating AML laws. The banking system isn\u2019t failing \u2014 failure is the system. I believe regulations are mostly signaling. There may be good examples of effective regulation, but they are rare.\nDoes rent-control work? It works for the people who are renting those low-priced apartments! Many of them have nice second homes that they rent out or enjoy on weekends. This policy can interfere with market forces and reduce rennovation and new building. Tennants argue in favor of rent control, and there may be other ways to achieve the same ends, but a thorough review of the literature concludes that it provides no net benefit.\nDo minimum-wage laws work? Most of the research shows that increased wages are passed on to customers, employers hire fewer people, benefits are cut, and industry revenues are less overall. However, the debate on this worth understanding, with other studies showing different effects.*\nDoes technical trading work? It doesn\u2019t. There are many chart-based and technical systems for trying to read markets. These systems are so widespread that they are already built into most prices. Going against them would have a better chance than following them. If you see candlesticks and shapes, run.\nDoes fundamental investing work? Not so much. Everyone has the same information, which means \u201cthe fundamentals\u201d are already priced in, so you can\u2019t get an edge by studying reports and analyses. Stock market investing is a game of wolves and sheep, where the wolves are those with a computing and algorithmic or data advantage, and the sheep are all the rest of us. Hedge funds are in an arms race to create profitable algorithms, and now most of those funds have reached the same plateau. Even Warren Buffett says he can\u2019t beat the market (and hasn\u2019t in over 20 years). Those who have an edge over the market usually make money until their edge disappears, often surprisingly quickly. The problem is skewness, which you can understand from reading this technical paper or by reading The Black Swan, by Nassim Taleb. My favorite book on investing is A Man for All Markets, by Ed Thorp.\nSo how should I invest? Passively. Most of us mortals can\u2019t generate alpha, so it\u2019s better to capture beta. That means take advantage of the average gains of various asset classes. Have exposure to global markets, real estate, and inefficient asset classes. Try to find \u201csmart beta\u201d opportunities. As Eliezer Yudkowsky says, \u201cAn efficient market is one where smart individuals should generally doubt that they can spot overpriced or underpriced assets.\u201d Most markets are very efficient. If you can pick the winners ahead of time, by all means give it a try. You might get lucky.*\nShould I buy or hold gold? Gold has traditionally been seen as a hedge against inflation. However, people don\u2019t understand that the central banks cause 100 percent of long-term inflation. Central banks currently target 2 percent, and they are good at undershooting that target, making gold useless as a hedge against runaway inflation. A second fear is the total meltdown of a government or its fiat system of money. While it has happened in places like Argentina and Venezuela, only conspiracy theorists are worried about a major currency going under. Even F. A. Hayek explained that gold is a poor form of money. Real estate is generally a better, but less liquid, store of value.\nShould I buy or hold cryptocurrencies? Cryptocurrencies are not money. We are decades away from any cryptocurrency becoming accepted as money. They are speculative assets. Bitcoin, for example, is much better than gold as a store of value, though it is taxed very inefficiently in most countries and regulators interfere with the market value. In general, cryptocurrencies are extremely volatile and risky. A little exposure isn\u2019t a bad idea.\nShould I invest in mutual funds? No, they add no value, they are \u201cexpensive sheep\u201d getting eaten by the wolves. Some small number of mutual funds beat index funds each year, only to be dethroned by other lucky funds the next year. Passive investing produces the best long-term results on average; getting phenomenally lucky produces the best long-term results.\nDo analysts produce fair analyses of investment products? Studies show that analysts game the system to produce the best results for themselves, not for their clients. This is true of journalists and analysts in every field. Journalists may mean well, but they care about their jobs, their careers, and hitting deadlines. They are rarely evidence-based. But some are.\nHow do we choose leaders in the US, and do they matter? The way we elect government officials is bizarre, people with deeper voices get elected more often, and presidents have less impact on the economy than we think. Studies show that CEOs are far less impactful on their firms than is generally believed. Presidents and CEOs tend to be much taller than average because we are biased toward thinking tall people are better leaders, but they aren\u2019t.\nWhat is the war on cyber crime? Is it working? Almost all cybercrime and security professionals admit: we are actively losing the war on cybercrime and it is guaranteed to get much worse in industry, finance, and government. Cyber crime has a power-law distribution, which means black swans can potentially be devastating. Regulation is not the answer. A better idea is decentralization of valuable assets. It\u2019s very likely that the majority of funds spent to deter or punish cyber crime are wasted. Cyber-criminals have the advantage because there are so many targets to choose from, so many ways to attack, and so many non-criminals to hide among. I expect cyber crime will become a much bigger issue in the future, and blockchains can really help.\nDoes the income tax work? It manages to raise the money the government spends. But at what cost? In the US, the IRS spends $11 billion each year to collect $3 trillion, but this doesn\u2019t count the cost of compliance to taxpayers and companies, which amounts to around $400 billion dollars, and another $400 billion is not collected. The US tax code is so complex that even the IRS doesn\u2019t understand it, and it takes 6 billion hours each year to compute and pay (or not pay) it. The tax gap in Europe is on the order of $1 trillion per year. Taxing consumption and luxury aligns incentives better. One exciting proposal is the Fair Tax, which allows for a \u201cprebate\u201d that pays all citizens a certain amount, helping those who need it (also lets us experiment with universal basic income). Another is the Harberger scheme for valuing and taxing assets. Serious tax reform can reduce tax-collection costs by over ninety percent.\nDoes spending money on the military make us safe? Because military spending is highly political, and because war is a black-swan event, decisionmaking at the highest level is rarely based on cost-benefit analysis. The usual approach is to throw more money at the military and let the experts handle it. At the highest level, decisions to go to war are almost always seen later as wrong or based on faulty evidence. My guess is that most countries are wasting at least 2/3 of their military dollars. This matters to most people more than they realize, because it\u2019s their money. I don\u2019t have good data to support my hunches, so I need to learn more. Please send me any good studies/data.\nWhat causes terrorists? Generally, terrorists are a reaction to bad policies. Most terrorists are not religious zealots, they are people disenfranchised by the system. One of the best books I\u2019ve found on the topic is Root Causes of Terrorism: Myths, Reality and Ways Forward. We can generally look back 10\u201320 years before any terrorist event and see how a government policy or program created that terrorist. I need some help finding the data to understand this better.\nDoes voting work? Voting in many places is so poorly designed that the outcomes are often predictable using simple heuristics like asking kindergartners which candidate looks like \u201cthe captain of the ship.\u201d Public choice is an active area of research with many well known principles and mechanism designs that almost no one uses. People are talking about quadratic voting to level the playing field and allocate resources using those who know the most about each topic. We could use a blockchain to run such a scheme. This is an active area of research that is far ahead of practice. It is time to overhaul voting (and reduce the need for it as much as possible).\nDoes representational government work? Elected officials always put themselves ahead of their jobs, creating the agency problem. As a result, most countries\u2019 actual form of government is kleptocracy.* Running campaigns and winning elections requires a different set of skills than governing. We can now use technology to govern using new principles and mechanisms. One such principle is futarchy, where voting costs money and allocates resources efficiently. Liberal radicalism is a new idea for allocating resources. Several groups are experimenting with decentralized autonomous organizations. The ideas in the book Radical Markets* are food for thought.\nDo immigrants improve our quality of life? In general, they do. Even in countries that are modern and have full employment, immigrants are usually worth bringing in because they add more than their fair share to the economy. In places like Europe and the US, with slowing and aging populations, immigration is an important driver of economic growth. We should be looking at open borders and new ideas in immigration policy. I haven\u2019t seen any evidence-based arguments for closed borders, but I have seen emotional ones. Would it work to have a world of completely open borders?\nDoes management work? It\u2019s not a straightforward answer. Certainly, some businesses are well managed. But the business press is full of fashionable gurus promoting the latest management fads. An excellent article shows that people quit jobs, not firms. The shift from top-down to flatter organizations probably hasn\u2019t really done much to improve employee engagement or effectiveness. Self-management is an ongoing experiment. There are many management systems and anecdotes of success, yet those researchers who study failure find the same principles at work that are supposed to cause success. Some companies have found the secret recipe or developed systems that work, while others are still working on it and most others have not. If you think people work for money, watch Daniel Pink unpack the latest research:\nDo boards of directors help a company? Probably not, though few researchers have studied this. CEOs choose board members who are aligned with their salary goals. Many boards are passive. They rarely prevent disaster, though some might. Studies point to long-term stock ownership rather than short-term compensation as part of the solution.\nIs CEO pay justified? Here, the data is mixed. On one side, we have data showing there is no correlation between CEO pay and company performance.* A growing body of research also shows that pay for performance does not work, yet CEO salaries drift ever upward as a result of popular myths that these tall, mostly white male, lucky people are worthy leaders. On the other hand, one study showed that companies with well-compensated CEOs far outperform those with lower-paid CEOs and Tyler Cowen argues that CEOs capture less of the value they bring to corporations than other employees.* Correlation or causation? I guess it\u2019s a little more complicated than I thought.\nShould we have software patents? The patent system is under tremendous strain \u2014 another institution left behind by the 21st century. Many companies register patents defensively or as marketing requires. Some software patents are simply too short-sighted or too broad. Patent trolls are controversial. The current environment for patents does not encourage enough innovation. While there is no shortage of good ideas, patent reform is hard. Some people think patents are good for society and encourage innovation. I think patents are granted arbitrarily, there are different rules across borders, and software patents hold the world back. But \u2014 I might be wrong.\nDoes professional licensing benefit society? There is a rich body of literature showing that for everything from real-estate agents to insurance to wealth management to doctors to airplane pilots, professional licenses are made-up and serve no beneficial purpose. They are highly varied, inhibit innovation and automation, they make regional market for labor less responsive. The United States is over-licensed. Many studies have shown that people consistently game the system to improve their own outcomes, not the outcomes of patients, clients, and passengers. Behind every licensing body is a political lobbying organization that puts its own needs first. Licensing makes it hard for people to move to new areas when markets change. But mostly, licensing promotes a charade that licensed people are the only way to run an industry, when we have a) good examples of industries that run quite well without them and b) many examples of licensed professionals who don\u2019t act in the best interests of their clients. Some favor reforming licensing, which is reasonable. I favor eliminating it, which is radical. I if we really need rules, we can code the correct behavior into software, not people.\nHow much should we trust experts? Not much. In engineering, they mostly agree. But in complex adaptive systems, there are many experts with opposing views. David Freedman has shown that experts are overconfident and often wrong. The more \u201cimportant\u201d they are, the less we look at their actual track records. Double-blind taste tests show that wine experts cannot consistently identify wines they have previously identified many times. Economists are worse.\nWhat should we do about fake news? Recognize that it is not new. Is there such a thing as unbiased reporting? Has there ever been? \u201cFacts\u201d have a way of deteriorating and rarely remain factual for more than a few years. Many (probably the majority) of professional \u201cjournals\u201d exist simply to deliver marketing messages. Can it ever be fixed? I don\u2019t think it can. Messaging is an arms race \u2014 people will always try to game the system to tilt the playing field in their favor. Maybe the problem is truth itself.\nAre diamonds really scarce? They are not scarce. To see how much they are worth, try to sell a used diamond. A diamond is simply a signal of spending money. The DeBeers company began a marketing campaign in 1938 to convince men to spend an entire paycheck on an engagement ring. It worked like a charm! Women now expect this symbol of forever and feel less worthy if they don\u2019t get it. Diamond prices do not reflect supply and demand.\nIs healthcare effective? There is no question that, around the world, basic health care is effective. I will pause to let the amazing Hans Rosling show us the good news:\nNow for the bad news: most marginal (extra) health-care dollars do not bring more health. The Rand health care study extensively compared people spending different amounts on health care and found no difference in outcomes. Studies of states where health care costs differ widely for the same drugs/treatments show no difference in outcomes. The economics of health care are highly skewed, manipulated, and gamed. Doctors still don\u2019t wash their hands! It should come as no surprise that doctors often treat according to what makes the most money, not what is best for patients. Canadians with Cystic Fibrosis live, on average, 10 years longer than Americans with the same condition. In the US, we are wasting between a quarter and half of our healthcare dollars each year, much of it on excessive administration, the most complex cases and end-of-life for elderly people, though those costs have started to come down in the last decade. Canada\u2019s administrative fees are far lower than those in the US. Health care reform is necessary to save the US from spending ever more and getting ever less.\nIs smoking really bad for you? Yes, it\u2019s remarkably bad. Smoking causes one out of every four deaths from cardiovascular disease. Even one cigarette per day increases chances of heart disease. Taxing cigarettes reduces their use.\nShould women get screened for breast cancer? If you get a positive mammogram, you are likely to be treated, and too many of those treatments are unnecessary and can lead to harm or death. This is a much-studied but very difficult topic that takes many years to see results. Mammography is the gold standard; thermography is quackery. Here are the current recommendations from Uptodate.com for women who don\u2019t have any risk factors: Below age 40: no screening; 40\u201349: It\u2019s up to you, but ask yourself and your doctor what you will do if you get a positive; 50+ they recommend screening every two years. Consult a qualified statistician before entering the medical sales funnel.\nWhat about colonoscopy? Harriet Hall reports: \u201cColonoscopy cuts the incidence of colon cancer and of death from colon cancer by more than half. And it\u2019s clearly superior to sigmoidoscopy in detecting cancers in the right side of the colon (proximal colon).\u201d She continues: \u201cThere is still no evidence from randomized controlled trials directly comparing fecal occult blood tests (FOBT) with colonoscopy, but such trials are in progress.\u201d Current screening recommendations: FOBT annually, sigmoidoscopy every 5 years, or colonoscopy every 10 years from age 50 to 75. I choose colonoscopy.\nWhat are the recommendations for prostate cancer screening for men? No PSA tests, ever. If you have some risk factors for prostate cancer early in life, talk with your doctor, but if you have no risk factors, stay away from prostate tests. Don\u2019t confuse enlarged prostate with cancer. I have written a short essay on what a scam the PSA test is.* Prostate cancer can metastasize and kill you, but it\u2019s most likely to kill you after age 80, when any number of things can kill you (even then, it only kills one in 40). On the other hand, if you are treated, you may have to live many years with the results of the treatment, which can significantly impact your life. I assume I have prostate cancer, so I don\u2019t need a test; I plan to live with it and die of something else.\nWhat about hormone replacement therapy for women? The Million Women Study (2003) showed a strong increase in cancer development and recommended no HRT unless the alternative is worse. A large meta-study reported in JAMA (2002) concluded: \u201cBenefits of HRT include prevention of osteoporotic fractures and colorectal cancer ... Harms include heart disease, stroke, thromboembolic events, breast cancer with 5 or more years of use, and cholecystitis.\u201d The Women\u2019s Health Initiative Study results (2002) showed that the health risks exceeded benefits. According to UpToDate: don\u2019t use HRT to prevent disease, and treat post-menopausal symptoms with low-dose vaginal estrogen cream.\nWhat about testosterone replacement therapy for men? This study (2000) shows benefits of using testosterone cream to improve ED and general virility. Because I\u2019ve read The Trouble with Testosterone, I know it\u2019s all relative, and taking testosterone can increase estrogen in an arms-race of increased dosage to get the same benefit. Using cream in strategic places seems to be the preferred treatment for both men and women who have symptoms.\nShould we get regular check-ups? The studies are clear on this: They do more harm than good, both economically and medically. While there are a few outlying conditions that could be caught early in a check-up, it also puts many people on a slippery slope of medical intervention. A cost-benefit analysis says check-ups are a losing proposition. Same for dental check-ups. The rule is: don\u2019t see a doctor unless you have symptoms you think won\u2019t go away otherwise. The human body runs well on most fuel, without vitamins and other interventions. There are exceptions to this rule, but it\u2019s generally a good one.\nAre antibiotics a serious problem? Yes. Most antibiotics are given to livestock, get into our food supply, and cause antibiotic resistance. This is bad. New strains of bacteria have already rendered several classes of antibiotics ineffective. Antibiotics have been critical to the success of the human species, yet 80 percent now goes into animals we eat and 30 percent of prescriptions are unnecessary. The front line in this war is in hospitals, where the most potent antibiotics are creating the next generation of superbugs we won\u2019t be able to fight later. Even antibiotics in soap could hasten the ineffectiveness of today\u2019s antibiotics. Watch this shocking video to get a sense of how quickly germs can mutate ...\nIn general, I recommend very light regulation. In this case, if we want our kids to have the benefits of antibiotics, we must review feeding antibiotics to livestock, prevent overprescription, ban over-the-counter antimicrobial soap, and look closely at limiting other anti-microbial products.\nWhat can be done about arthritis? Arthritis affects a lot of people. This page at ScienceBasedMedicine explains the pathology and treatment options.* Exercise and weight loss are the first things to work on. Treatment comes in two forms: pain/inflammation management and cartilage repair. For the first category, NSAIDs (over-the-counter anti-inflammatories) can help if you tolerate them. Popular cures (soy, omega-3s, glucosamine, chondroitin, vitamins, willow, etc.) have no advantage over placebo. For the second, some cartilage-based therapies are promising but need more research. Ultimately, we will have stem-cell-based therapies, but they are decades away.\nDo vitamins make us more healthy? There is a lot of good evidence that for all healthy people, vitamins are useless at best and harmful at worst. Taking a daily pill may have a placebo effect. Pregnant women should definitely get folate and may want to consider other options but read this first.* Those not planning to get pregnant should probably not take extra folate.\nDon\u2019t we need vitamin C? We do not. I don\u2019t believe we should define scurvy as a \u201clack of vitamin C.\u201d All animals need vitamin C, and most don\u2019t get it in their diet. Most of them make vitamin C from precursors they get in their diet. Cows, cats, and cobras make their own vitamin C, and so do humans. If you eat nothing but fresh raw meat, I am quite sure you won\u2019t get scurvy. I would define scurvy as \u201ca lack of fresh food.\u201d The way to get scurvy is to eat salted meats for months, and that killed more than 20 million sailors before James Lind finally figured it out.\nDoes having a child and breastfeeding prevent breast cancer? It seems so \u2014 earlier is better, and at least six months exclusive breastfeeding is better. To learn more about breastfeeding benefits for both mother and child, start with this summary of the evidence.\nWhy is testosterone going down? We know that testosterone in the US and a few other countries has been declining for decades (but not sperm counts). We don\u2019t know why. Testosterone is relative \u2014 the absolute number doesn\u2019t tell you very much. People suspect obesity, illness, medication, preservatives, even soy products, but no study has shown anything conclusive. Keep in mind: anything that raises estrogen has the effect of reducing testosterone, as they are relative. My personal candidate is porn. Since the early 1990s, porn has risen exponentially, just as erectile dysfunction in men under 40 has increased. Could pornography addiction be the real cause? We see more and more evidence that porn is having a very real effect on men.\nDoes using cell phones cause cancer? No they don\u2019t. I\u2019ll let Derek take you through the literature.*\nShould you have your wisdom teeth removed if they don\u2019t hurt? No.\nWhat about metal tooth fillings? We don\u2019t have any reason to believe that they are toxic or a danger.\nWhat about recreational drugs? Despite decades of intervention, the demand for drugs continues to grow. Governments spend huge amounts trying to interdict agricultural products from places like Bolivia and Afghanistan, it\u2019s a crime to sell these products, many people go to jail, and the market continues to get what it wants. The war on drugs has considerably increased the potency of most recreational drugs, and this is causing many deaths by overdose. Even drug-enforcement agents say it is a lost cause. By any measure, the war on drugs has failed and in fact is unwinnable. We should focus on education and demand, not supply.\nWhat about addictive drugs like opioids? Opioid addiction and overdose kills hundreds of thousands worldwide each year. We now have opioids that are so concentrated, the amount in a small backpack can kill everyone in a large city. These drugs are now relatively cheap to make.* The days of coca leaves and Afghan poppy are over. We must focus on both demand and prescriptions as well as education. I believe the problem lies more with addiction than with the substances \u2014 two people can have very different addictive reactions to the same drug. Idea: make people get licenses for dangerous drugs, and if you abuse the drug (or your license) you lose your license. Use randomly controlled experiments to find new solutions.\nDo osteoporosis drugs work? It\u2019s complicated and discouraging. Diagnosis and treatment are highly variable. Several drugs have been shown to be effective at reducing fractures in frail, elderly people. But the side effects are extreme, and most patients should \u201ctake a break\u201d from the drugs after five years. Even the recommendation to take calcium pills has now been withdrawn. Calcium probably doesn\u2019t help anyway. The most recent \u201cbreakthrough\u201d drug does seem to help (but also kills a small number of patients early). The cure is mostly worse than the disease! All studies are on postmenopausal women (the big market for drugs); we have almost no data on men. If breaking a bone could be fatal to you (generally, those over 85 years old), discuss your options with several doctors. For people over 40, I believe osteopenia is overdiagnosed \u2014 unless you have other risk factors, ignore it. Exposure to sunlight or UV radiation helps build bone (though taking vitamin D doesn\u2019t) and not getting enough sunlight can be detrimental. Perhaps in ten years we\u2019ll have better options. For now, Dr Susan Ott\u2019s site is a good place to learn more. More on this topic in the Epilogue.\nDo statins make you live longer? Only if you take them daily. Statins (cholesterol-lowering drugs) are some of the most studied drugs in history. We know from many many studies that they prolong life. Statins are cheap, have few side effects, and extend life. They aren\u2019t for everyone \u2014 there are risk factors and side effects. Dr Rob Siegel (yes relation) says: \u201cFor patients who tolerate them, statins lower LDL and lead to health benefits that exceed what we would expect from LDL lowering alone.\u201d If you tolerate them and you\u2019re over 40, talk with your doctor about taking statins for the rest of your life. I do.\nWhat about supplements and nutraceuticals? The worldwide market for supplements (vitamins, botanicals, minerals, amino acids, enzymes, etc) is already at $240 billion and growing fast. Believe it or not, a few of them actually work. Saw Palmetto has been shown to reduce symptoms of enlarged prostate. St. John\u2019s wort is better than placebo (but not necessarily drugs) for treating mild depression, BUT St. John\u2019s wort interacts negatively with many prescription medications. Green tea shows maybe some benefit, but even if the tea is strong, the evidence is weak. A few other supplements may turn out to be helpful and safe.* Most of the rest do nothing but help the companies that sell the products. Echinacea hasn\u2019t been shown to prevent or reduce cold symptoms. Unfortunately, more than half of pharmacists recommend nutraceuticals. Most supplements do nothing, some cause real harm, a few work, and a surprising number are tainted with actual prescription drugs. Should this industry be regulated? What do you think?\nWhat about herbal remedies? Three out of four Americans takes a supplement regularly, and they cause 23,000 emergency-room visits each year in the US. Herbal remedies are unregulated drugs. They can interact with each other or any medication you may be taking. Americans buy $8 billion of herbals (top of the list: horehound), but are they better off? Unfortunately, people take a natural pill, they feel better, they tell themselves a story of causation, then they tell their friends, and the news of a new cure spreads like wildfire. Entrepreneurs rush to fill the market need. Yet whenever scientists try to evaluate these drugs they find no effectiveness. Could it be that skepticism turns off the magic healing power of herbal remedies?\nWhat about canabinoids? Medical marijuana and canabinoids do have some effects. However, there is much more enthusiasm for sales than for double-blind, placebo-controlled data. For epilepsy, researchers have found significant benefit, but for relief of anixiety, pain, nausea, and other symptoms, they haven\u2019t seen any real signals yet. Steve Novella has a good summary, showing that we are just at the beginning to understand what the benefits and harms may be.\nWhat about homeopathy? As placebos go, I highly recommend homeopathy, because it\u2019s nothing but water. In fact, I love homeopathy, seriously. It has no side effects (unless the water is infected with bacteria \u2014 you have to watch quality control when you\u2019re bottling water). On a cost/benefit basis, it\u2019s about the best way to engage the power of placebos. The packaging, the seriousness with which the licensed naturopath chooses your remedy, the instructions, the price \u2014 all of this makes for the perfect placebo treatment. And placebos work amazingly well. It has to be at least as effective as (and safer than) much of the quack medicine practiced in hospitals and doctor\u2019s offices. If it\u2019s probably going to go away anyway \u2014 and most symptoms do \u2014 see your local homeopathist to make it go away faster!\nWhat about chiropractic manipulation? There is nothing but anecdotal evidence for chiropractors and their charade of practicing \u201cmedicine.\u201d There is no strong evidence in favor of spinal manipulation to cure various conditions. The cure is often worse than the disease, and chiropractic pediatrics should probably be outlawed. If you love your chiropractor, please click on and read those articles before you contact me to tell me I\u2019m wrong.\nWhat about eating grapefruit while on certain drugs? It turns out that grapefruit juice does interfere with the actions of many drugs. Your digestive tract has an enzyme called cytochrome P450 3A4 that\u2019s responsible for the inactivation of about half of all oral drugs. Knowing this, drug companies give you more of those drugs than you can handle. Furanocoumarins \u2014 the active ingredients in grapefruit and a few other non-sweet citrus fruits \u2014 render the enzyme ineffective, which gives you an overdose of the drug. See this list of drugs affected. For some drugs, like statins, you would have to drink a lot of grapefruit juice to interfere, but other drugs are much more sensitive. If you drink a glass of grapefruit juice even once a week, always ask the doctor when getting a new prescription.\nHow much of a problem is obesity? Is obesity really bad for you? It\u2019s a complex question, since other lifestyle and genetic factors could be more influential. Obesity probably contributes marginally to many diseases but is not the single driver of poor health. Being overweight is protective of certain diseases. Reducing obesity definitely improves health, but not by as much as you may think. One well designed meta-study showed that mildly overweight people outlive people with lower body-mass indexes.\nWhy are adults and children so much fatter than 40 years ago? People are definitely getting fatter, it causes more disease, and we don\u2019t know why it\u2019s happening. There are many interesting hypotheses and none of them has emerged as the clear cause. Could it be portion sizes? Urbanization? Gestational? Genetics? Carbohydrates? Breastfeeding? Ethnicity? Watching TV? Sugar may play a role but probably not as much as people think. It\u2019s likely a combination and that genetic differences complicate the situation. We have more questions than answers.\nWhat is a healthy diet? There\u2019s no such thing as a \u201chealthy diet\u201d \u2014 research here is very poor, with very few claims verified. What works for one person does not work for all, there are many confounders and a lack of good studies. Bill and Melinda gates, who want to help us understand what a good diet is, are wasting their money on rigorous nonsense. Michael Pollan\u2019s advice to \u201cEat food, not too much, mostly plants\u201d sounds good to me. Steve Novella says \u201cBalanced macronutrients from a varied diet is likely best.\u201d One recipe doesn\u2019t work for everyone; we should treat different people differently.*\nAre some people gluten intolerant? The market for gluten-free foods is over $4 billion, yet there is almost no real evidence for non-celiac gluten sensitivity.* It\u2019s likely that most people who believe they are gluten intolerant aren\u2019t, and a few are potentially pre-celiac or somehow have mild symptoms of celiac disease. If you believe you are gluten sensitive, then either you have some degree of celiac disease or you have something else you are not treating, and that could be dangerous. I have thought about how to make a home-test kit, but I\u2019m not sure the market exists \u2014 people are willing to spend on gluten-free food but not on a test.\nDo we need to get enough protein? We have no idea what \u201cenough protein\u201d is for humans. We only know a few things: 1) people who are undernourished need food, which includes protein, 2) most diets include 12\u201320 percent protein, it\u2019s hard to get less or more than that, 3) Even weightlifters don\u2019t need more protein than the general population, 4) people who eat low-protein diets may have more osteoporosis/fractures. This Harvard article gives a decent overview. This Stanford study (2019) shows that Americans get too much protein at the expense of the environment. One thing that may help: there aren\u2019t any symptoms for not getting enough protein (nothing to do with being tired, headaches, weak nails or hair, etc). The symptom would be hunger. With only very rare exceptions, chronic symptoms are caused by other things. There is very little data on protein requirements for humans. We need more study in this area. See the epilogue.\nAre trans-fats bad for us? Yes. Several studies confirm that margarine made with trans fats contributes to heart disease. One of the few solid findings in nutrition science!\nWhat about whole grains, fresh fruits, vegetables, fiber, salad? There is more and more evidence that eating whole grains helps avoid some cancers and even other diseases. Some recent research points to more health benefits. But this research is difficult \u2014 you can\u2019t hold everything else constant. Eating a lot of fiber probably reduces your risk of colorectal cancer. Consuming plenty of olive oil is almost certainly good for your heart (though we don\u2019t really know why). Will you live longer if you eat brown, rather than white, rice all your life? My guess: statistically, those who eat whole grains all their lives may live \u201ca bit\u201d longer than others. I plan to die \u201ca bit\u201d early as a result.\nWhat about vegetarians and vegans? I\u2019ve been vegan for 35 years. I am in good shape and people say I look ten years younger. Research says there\u2019s no health difference between vegetarians and the rest of the population and that vegans maybe need to get some B12 and a few other supplements (we really don\u2019t know). The most recent metastudy (not a huge amount of data, but probably the best we have to-date) shows a few general benefits to being vegan and no negative effects. There is some evidence that vegans have lower bone density and mixed evidence for higher fracture rates: no fractures for asians (2012), yes fractures in elderly patients (2009. All this evidence is weak at best. This Stanford study shows that most people get too much protein and says: \u201cVegetarian and even vegan diets typically contain adequate amounts of protein, including adequate amounts of all 20 amino acids ...\u201d I have been \u201cmostly vegan\u201d for 35 years. I hope there is more study of these diets. More on my journey in the Epilogue.\nDoes drinking sugary drinks make people fat? Maybe not (2008). Or maybe yes (2010). Or maybe yes (2013). My guess: drinking a lot of sugary drinks definitely makes some people fat. For most people, the effect is probably less dramatic.\nDo diets work? Almost all of them do. For a few weeks or months, sometimes as long as a year. And then, almost all of them fail. The weight comes back (though diet and exercise are better than either alone). The problem is the endocrine system, which is trying to go back to the \u201cnormal\u201d weight from before. Restricting calories in the long term generally does nothing to reduce weight.* Increasing exercise tends to be an arms race \u2014 you need to exercise more and more just to not gain the weight back. While some people get out of this trap, at least ninety percent do not.\nDo low-fat diets work? It was once believed that saturated fats cause heart disease. We now know it\u2019s more complicated than that. In general, the stigma against fats is gone, and eating fat in moderation is part of a healthy diet for most people. In 2005, we thought low-carb diets actually were better at losing and keeping weight off. Today, we know less than we knew then. The trend now is away from low-fat (high carb) diets. Since the 1980s, we have known that unrefined carbohydrates are absorbed differently from highly refined grains and starches. The \u201cglycemic index\u201d probably helps steer people toward healthy options, but I expect it works better for some than others.\nDo low-carb diets work? Low-carb diets may be slightly preferable for many people, but in studies up to one year, they still produce no better results than any other diet (see Chris Gardner\u2019s video summarizing his study*). For the long term, we don\u2019t really know. It\u2019s very expensive to study people carefully for even three months. We definitely need to keep looking at this, because if low-carb diets really worked, we would see overwhelming evidence of that, and we don\u2019t. (I hope John and Laura Arnold are funding more work in this area.) My guess is that we need to understand different genetic factors of glycemic response* before we can prescribe a particular weight-loss regimen.\nWhat about a ketogenic diet? Nope. This diet may work for people with diabetes, but it doesn\u2019t work for most.\nWhat about the paleo diet? I think people just made up the idea of a paleo diet, since actual hunter gatherers had a wide variety of diets. We have almost zero evidence that the diet promoted in a popular book is beneficial.\nWhat about antioxidants? They don\u2019t help. They may hurt. I would present the other side of the argument, but it doesn\u2019t exist.\nWhat about fish oil and omega-3 fatty acids? We thought for a few decades that antioxidants would help people live longer, but it was really never more than a hunch. You can see the benefit in a petri dish but not in studies of human health. At this point, we don\u2019t have any evidence that they are beneficial. If you\u2019re taking them, read Steve Novella\u2019s update.\nIs a Mediterranean diet good for you? Probably, but it depends on several factors. It seems that olive oil is good for you, or a balance of carbs and fats is good, or working outside most of your life, or a glass of wine each day (or not (2018), or not! (2012), or some genetic component is really driving the results. It does seem to be better for your heart than other diets tested. A growing number of small signals points more and more to the Mediterranean diet as a pretty good way to eat, but it\u2019s not a slam dunk and at least one carefully controlled trial showed no health benefit. Should all Chinese people should start eating lentils and ciabatta with olive oil? Maybe not, but Australians and Americans would likely be better off.\nWhat about saturated fat? Prevailing wisdom, circa 1990: that steak is a widowmaker! In 2010: saturated fat does not cause heart disease. 2017: this excellent article concludes that saturated fat likely is a contributing factor to heart disease. A 2018 study drew the same conclusion. So the balance may be tipping again toward reducing saturated fat (but taking statins is probably more important). If you don\u2019t have other risk factors and do eat a lot of saturated fat (remember, coconut oil is saturated), read the 2017 piece.\nWhat about cholesterol? It\u2019s clear that cholesterol is a driver of heart disease. Eating eggs raises cholesterol. The average American eats about 5\u20136 eggs a week. If your egg consumption is much higher, the current recommendation is to bring it down to normal. The advice on dietary cholesterol and outcomes (heart attacks, stroke, death) is not based on very solid evidence. Some researchers say take statins even if your cholesterol is low; others say use statins only if diet and exercise don\u2019t lower your LDL numbers enough. Recent research suggests that some people may be \u201ccholesterol sensitive.\u201d This study shows the variability of individual response (see fig 4). I hope we\u2019ll learn more about that in the future.\nDoes exercise help people lose weight? A bit. Not much. If it were a clear win, we would know. Some people do start an exercise program and manage to keep the weight off. I don\u2019t think we can explain how it works for them but not for almost everyone else. Regardless, exercise helps make people more healthy, even if they don\u2019t lose weight.\nDoes surgery help people lose weight? For obese and morbidly obese patients, surgery is far more effective than any other intervention. Here is the excellent story version.*\nIs fasting beneficial? Can it make us live longer? Maybe. I expect that humans born in a hundred years will live much longer than we do today. Not because of fasting, but because we will learn how to cure ageing (possibly sooner than we had thought, watch this). We\u2019ve known for decades that calorie restriction for lab animals lengthens their lives. But in humans, how will we know what works? A two-year study showed improved biomarkers for non-obese participants, but don\u2019t think biomarkers are significant \u2014 what counts is longevity. It can\u2019t hurt, but calorie restriction is unlikely to extend life very much. I started eating much less about 8 months ago and love it. I don\u2019t fast, but I do go hungry. I don\u2019t care if it lengthens my life; it increases the quality of my life tremendously.\nWhich foods cause cancer? We really have very few clues here, because cause and effect is so difficult to tease out of so many different variables. Processed meats very likely do contribute to colorectal cancer in some people, and well-done meat shows similar potential to cause cancer. Char-broiled meat probably has some carcinogenic effect. We might say the same for simple carbohydrates as well. Problem is that cancer takes a long time, and there are many potential confounders in the environment, genetics, and other factors. We can\u2019t expect more information on this without long-term controlled trials, which are unlikely (Laura and John Arnold \u2014 can you help here?).\nDoes taking drugs or drinking while pregnant cause birth defects? We\u2019ll probably never know, because the randomly controlled trial necessary to learn this is unethical. In most cases, it could easily be a case of anecdotal correlation, not causation. A woman who drinks often may not take folate and that increases the risk of birth defects. Yet in extreme cases, there is very likely a higher risk of damage to the child, whether in the form of birth defects or dependencies or various forms of mental health. I don\u2019t think we\u2019ll ever know if drinking a glass of wine a day has any effect \u2014 I suspect it doesn\u2019t.\nWhat about eating organic food? There is no measurable benefit to eating organic other than it costs more and makes money for organic producers. The Stanford study is the gold standard here, but it has been challenged. Meta-analyses (2012) show no health benefit to an organic diet. Organic food is almost certainly better for the environment, but whenever I say \u201calmost certainly\u201d I am usually wrong, so I\u2019m looking for the data on this, too.\nWhich parenting paradigm is best? In my experience, bookstores are filled with two kinds of books: those that advocate parents to better understand the world of the child and those that give parents tools to bring children into alignment with the adult world. In practice, I don\u2019t think it\u2019s possible to stay completely on one side of that line. While I\u2019m in favor of letting kids be kids and understanding their context, I get frustrated too easily and overcorrect. I know a lot of other parents do, too. My suggestion: read Alfie Kohn\u2019s books, subscribe to his newsletter, and try your best. And make a deal with your kids that if you screw up and punish them, then you should get punished too. One more thing: if your kids see the back of your phone, you will soon see the back of theirs.\nShould babies be breastfed? Babies benefit from breastfeeding, but for how long? This metastudy concludes that six months is a good minimum, but it\u2019s likely that three months gives most of the benefit. And formula isn\u2019t the worst thing. I was a formula baby, and look how grumpy I turned out!\nShould we circumcise boys? There is no scientific evidence that we should. A small percentage of males are harmed irreparably in the name of fashion. It could plausibly be seen as a direct counterpart to female circumcision.\nIs fluoride a public health concern? There is no basis for fluoride alarmism. Fluoridated water has been an effective public health intervention. The fluoride scare is a form of conspiracy theory, not based on scientific evidence. Fluoridated water = good policy.\nShould newborn babies get vitamin-K shots? I\u2019m surprised to say the answer is yes. Normally, I don\u2019t believe in medical intervention with the birth process, but here the evidence is clear. It may not help your child, but it helps a small percentage of children, and we can\u2019t tell who ahead of time \u2014 it\u2019s easier to give the shot than to do the test.\nDo vaccines actually work? Yes, vaccines work, they save lives. Arguments against vaccines are motivated by anecdotes, tribal belief systems, and misinformation. If you believe vaccines are harmful, you must address the outcome of the meta-study linked above and bring solid evidence to your argument. Measles outbreaks are becoming more common. We have to fight magical thinking* with facts and change our beliefs when the facts point in a different direction than we thought.\nDoes drinking milk build strong bones? Why should drinking cow\u2019s milk be good for humans? We don\u2019t have any evidence that drinking cow\u2019s milk reduces hip fractures, which is how we diagnose osteoporosis. Also no signal against heart disease. If drinking milk helped build strong bones, then Asians and people in many other places that don\u2019t drink milk would have weaker bones and more fractures. Do they? No (2005). No (2015). For children, it appears that drinking milk does improve bone mass, but that doesn\u2019t mean they have fewer fractures when they are older, they don\u2019t (2014). Milk gives you calories, but billions of people don\u2019t drink it and they are fine.\nDoes sugar make kids hyper? No (1996). Seriously (2011). Sugar and behavior may not be linked at all.\nDoes playing violent video games make kid more violent, depressed, or antisocial? It\u2019s a reasonable hypothesis, but you have to test it in the real world, not in your mind. In reality, suicide rates have increased in the US over the past few decades, but as Nir Eyal explains, it\u2019s not safe to assume that screens are the cause ...\nHow can we bring out children\u2019s intrinsic motivation? Not by trading rewards for behavior. Maybe it isn\u2019t about behavior at all. Punishing (usually called \u201cconsequences\u201d) doesn\u2019t work. Praise doesn\u2019t work. It turns out that being there for your kids and loving them unconditionally actually works. It\u2019s just hard to do.\nDo horoscopes and astrology work? No. People who believe in astrology are confusing coincidence with cause and effect. Example: we know that children born in the first quarter of the year often outperform their peers, simply because they miss the age cut-off for school and end up as the oldest in their class, which gives them an advantage. This does not mean that Aquarius are smarter or better at sports than January Capricorns! It means that December Capricorns (youngest in class) are generally behind their January Capricorn classmates (oldest). Correlation is not causation.\nWhat about afterlife and paranormal skills? There are many scientific studies showing that various people have paranormal skills. These studies are all \u2014 100 percent \u2014 poorly done and cherrypicking the data. There are logical explanations for all the \u201camazing results\u201d of astrology, of ghost sightings, for all UFOs, mediumship, and more. When we don\u2019t understand something, our imaginations jump to fill in the gaps.\nDo psychological drugs work? Some do, but most we have no idea. The vast majority of psych drugs are based on experiments that have not been confirmed, and the p-values cluster dangerously under 0.05.* This is the crisis of reproducibility.\nDo people fear losses more than they celebrate gains? This is the principle behind loss aversion, a central pillar of prospect theory. Daniel Kahneman relied extensively on this theory for many conclusions in his work on behavioral economics. As we often learn, \u201cit\u2019s a little more complicated than that\u201d \u2014 a recent paper titled The Loss of Loss Aversion challenges this theory and claims that most people give losses and gains roughly equal weight.*\nWhat about choice overload? We\u2019ve heard in books and TED talks that people don\u2019t want too many choices, they have to be nudged, they seize up when presented with too many choices, and that they buy more when they choose from fewer options. That body of work was based on a tiny number of experiments. A large metastudy shows that overload is a function of choice-set complexity, decision task difficulty, preference uncertainty, and decision goal, and these factors make a simple model impossible. It depends a lot on context. In many cases, consumers have no problem with a lot of options.\nCan people\u2019s personality be characterized by a single test? Many tests claim to provide a profile of a person\u2018s personality: Myers Briggs, Jungian archetypes, Freudian analysis, Brainspotting, the marshmallow test, IQ, Activity Vector, DISC, etc. Most are rigorous nonsense. One test that seems to be holding up best is the \u201cBig Five\u201d personality trait test. There hasn\u2019t been much research on it in the past twenty years, but there are some intriguing signs that there may be something there. I am interested to learn more.\nHow effective are police forces? Policing is subject to fads from various researchers, authors, and magazines. Policing suffers from \u201ccost sickness\u201d \u2014 police forces can\u2019t keep up with the demand for their services, they are chronically decades behind. Research shows little evidence that punishment of low-level offenses reduces serious crime \u2014 and considerable evidence that it disproportionately harms communities of color. People who are disenfranchised, desperately poor, substance-addicted, and/or mentally ill take up much of a modern police force\u2019s time. Arresting, charging, sentencing, and incarcerating these people is one of the least effective responses. Arnold Ventures is leading the way here.\nHow effective is the trial-by-jury process? Remarkably ineffective at determining who the true perpetrator of a crime is. Juries have no training in decision science, are not statistically literate, and are easily swayed by emotional arguments. It\u2019s complicated, and the nuances are often beyond a jury\u2019s capability to put into perspective. Some studies have shown that jury trials are largely effective. However, jury trials are very expensive, and a series of academic studies show that the court process is highly flawed. Sentencing is also extremely variable.\nDo bench trials work? Judges are human. They are not machines. Machines would almost certainly do a better job.*\nDoes gun control work? Yes, gun control can save many lives. The US has one of the least effective gun policies in the world and the results to show for it. The gun lobby prevents evidence-based policy. It\u2019s a complex problem, but gun laws, policies, and new technology can help.\nDoes prison work? The rate of incarceration in the US is unforgivable. The US leads the world in putting its citizens in jail. Prison is generally a) a poor deterrent and b) a cycle that, once started, tends to repeat. A randomly controlled trial in California showed that the amount of time people spend in prison does not correlate with how well they do once back outside. Parole boards don\u2019t work. Finding what really works is very complex. The incentives are misaligned. Mental illness is the elephant in the room.\nDo preschool programs work? Randomly controlled trials have shown that Head Start, a preschool development program, does not work better than no program. However, \u201cno program\u201d is probably worse for children living with bad parents. I believe other preschool programs have been found similarly lacking, but good research is showing the way forward.\nDoes testing students work? Absolutely not. Bryan Caplan explains: students who are good at taking tests are more obedient workers, but they don\u2019t add more value than poor test takers. Teachers teach to tests and students learn to pass tests, nothing to do with real life after school. Grades only give a signal to employers who think degrees and grades matter. There are much better ways to design a curriculum.\nDo small schools have better students than large schools? Bill Gates thought so. He gave more than $2 billion to the \u201cSmall Schools Movement,\u201d until they realized that larger schools outperform small schools on almost all measures (we measure \u201cquality\u201d with test scores, which is silly). In reality, large schools have more resources and give kids more choices. I would ask Bill and Melinda Gates: What is school really for? How can we help society move away from tests and signals and toward more productive, fulfilling lives?\nDoes homework help kids learn? You would think so, but Alfie Kohn shows evidence that homework does not help. Perhaps if it prevents kids from doing things that would harm them, but there is very little academic benefit.\nDoes a 4-year college education help? For the vast majority of people going through it, the answer is: the education probably doesn\u2019t, but the degree definitely does. We see an \u201ceducation premium\u201d among people with degrees in many areas (even bartenders with degrees make more money than those without), but I believe the effect is the degree (signal), not the education. The case against secondary education for most people* is remarkably strong, especially considering the debt incurred. Companies prefer to hire college graduates as a filtering mechanism. More and more, the best employees will not have college degrees. Solutions? Peter Diamandis has some good ideas. Xavier Niel\u2019s 42, Udacity\u2019s nanodegrees, Lambda School, Sudbury schools, and Khan Academy are good places to start. I agree with Tyler Cowen that to counteract automation, we will need to learn continuously.\nDo graduate degrees help? In hard sciences, graduate degrees have a strong track record. In business, psychology, economics, creative industries, and other soft sciences, the evidence is far less clear. Their major function is signaling to employers. The MBA in particular has no measurable effect on business. Jeff Pfeffer knows this better than anyone \u2014 he writes his brave reports from inside the machine. Station 1 may show the way forward.\nIs research effective? Most of the findings published by the world\u2019s most respected journals is wrong*. Research, funding, and publishing are all heavily biased and unlikely to help us learn much. Most research is statistically underpowered and unverified. Most research is gamed to produce the best career outcomes for researchers. Most research on animals is conducted on a single species of mouse that is very well understood but has little to do with human health. Derek Muller shows you in 12 minutes:\nIs research funding effective? Many studies are well done and unbiased, yet many are directly or indirectly affected by their source of funding. Getting funding is as much a beauty/popularity contest as it is about the merits of the research. Funders either want a particular result ahead of time (especially in pharmaceuticals, where research costs are so high), or they want to be associated with the \u201cbig names\u201d in research, they love being associated with spectacular newsworthy results. The majority of funded research projects should probably never take place, because they don\u2019t have the statistical power to produce significant results, regardless of the outcome.\nIs research publishing effective? Publishing scientific results has long been a game. Believe it or not, this is well documented in the published literature! The \u201cbig name\u201d publishers continue to release a stream of sensational results by famous researchers, and the concept of peer review has not been relevant for decades. Peer review is not the gold standard \u2014 it is often gamed. Moreover, the writing is incredibly poor, papers are not machine readable (they could be), and the data is difficult for third parties to get and work with. This is a critical horizontal layer for science, and it is broken. We have the ideas to fix publishing\u2014 the problem is entrenched business models. I think one billionaire could make a difference here.\nWhat does functional MRI imaging tell us about the brain? My guess is that 90 percent of fMRI neuroscience is rigorous nonsense. Signals in neurons travel at a velocity proportional to that of electricity in wires, while neuro-imaging measures blood flowing around the brain \u2014 a huge difference. Expensive machines around the world show regions of the brain \u201clighting up\u201d under various stimuli, providing \u201cclues\u201d about how we think. But those clues are often statistically underpowered and most likely as accurate as astrology in determining cause and effect. On the other hand, researchers are always looking for ways to improve, and \u2014 even though some of us may be surprised \u2014 this field may eventually bring us closer to understanding ourselves.\nAre fluorescent or LED light bulbs more efficient than incandescent? Yes. It was right to phase out incandescent bulbs. LEDs are better than fluorescent are better than incandescent. However, a new kind of incandescent bulb design may prove even better, and more breakthroughs are on the way.\nWho is poor? Fewer are living on less than $2 a day than we think. A lot has changed in the past 20 years. Today, the middle class is rising around the world, even as the divide between rich and poor widens. As the rich are getting much more wealthy, standards of living continue to rise across all continents. Our common view is of a huge gap between rich and poor, but in reality, the rise of the middle class is the big story. Many things we expect to work don\u2019t actually work. Smart, randomly controlled trials are showing us how to help poor people make their way toward the middle class.\nShould we be concerned about growing human population? Paul Ehrlich famously predicted an apocalyptic world as a result of exponential human population growth. But his \u201cpopulation bomb\u201d fizzled because the world can handle more people than we thought, affluence is the best birth control, and technology and innovation continue to raise the standard of living for everyone. The structure of our population growth this century is likely not only tolerable but desirable. I will let Hans amaze you:\nAre robots and Artificial Intelligence stealing our jobs? Not in the next 30 years, no. History repeatedly shows that as technology replaces repetitive work, more jobs are created (technological re-employment*). So far, technological unemployment is largely a myth. We are in the middle of a long trend of wage polarization*, where middle-paying non-college jobs are increasingly being replaced, while wages for low-paying and high-paying jobs have increased. This is a complex topic with many surprising twists and turns.* I believe we are now (2019) at \u201cpeak office worker\u201d for all of human history. I expect the next wave to be service jobs, which may peak around 2040, after which I think it will be all about mass replacement and niche specialization until early 2100s, when I expect most jobs will simply be done by machines.\nIs our privacy really at risk? As long as the Internet is free, people will leave trails that companies like Google pick up, use, sell, and resell. Did you know that every prescription you\u2019ve ever filled is available for marketers to buy? Privacy laws in Europe are hurting, not helping \u2014 they are too heavy to be sustainable. Privacy laws in the US can never keep up with giant technology companies that know every purchase, every web site, every search term, every mouse click. China is compiling a \u201csocial credit score\u201d on its citizens that started out as a local incentive to behave well but is now digital, complex, and disturbing*. Algorithms are getting more and more sophisticated. \u201cFree and easy\u201d is expensive and limits your choices. My company is trying to change that, but we will need better protection for consumers.*\nDoes the art market price works fairly? The art market is almost entirely arbitrary. Fame and prices are controlled by a small number of people. There is really no such thing as \u201cgood\u201d art, it\u2019s just another business. Too many young artists think that they will make a living as an artist, when market insiders cultivate a small number of early career \u201cdarlings\u201d to invest in, canonize, and profit from.\nDoes microcredit help the poor? It doesn\u2019t look like it. Randomized controlled trials have shown very little benefit to borrowers, while lenders do fairly well. Trying to help people effectively is hard.\nDoes social capitalism work? Probably in some cases, but in reality we know at least one experiment that didn\u2019t: After giving away over 60 million pairs of shoes to kids in developing countries, Tom\u2019s Shoes conducted a randomized controlled trial and measured the results between kids who received shoes and kids who didn\u2019t. Surprisingly, foot health was not improved, outdoor sports participation increased by a small amount, and children who received free shoes generally believed that foreigners should send them more of the things they need. The company now uses randomly controlled trials to measure the effect of all their giving (they found giving sports shoes as a reward for kids who do well in school has a remarkably positive impact on school performance, so that\u2019s their new strategy \u2014 we\u2019ll see how it turns out). Read Randomistas* for the whole story.\nDoes marriage work? Marriage has long been a political institution, subject to government by the majority. Why, exactly, can\u2019t same-sex people or three people get married? Certainly, some people are very invested in the state-sponsored institution of marriage. I propose that we have the problem backward: why get married at all? Marriage is not necessary to require parents pay for and take care of their children. All countries already have laws for that. In the US, both marriages and divorces are down significantly, showing lower demand for state-approved marriage. Given that so many marriages end in divorce, I favor getting rid of state-recognized relationship licenses. Marriage should be a private contract between two parties.\nDoes God exist? Do you mean there\u2019s a white man with a beard floating in the clouds or in space, even though white people evolved only about 20,000 years ago? Or do you believe in a higher power? I\u2019ll let Richard Dawkins, Christopher Hitchens, and Eliezer take it from here. While plenty of people will disagree, I believe organized religion does more harm than good and works first and foremost to protect those at the top of the hierarchy (the agency problem again). Scientists who believe in god simply haven\u2019t put enough work into deconstructing their own internal conflicts. Studies on happiness and life satisfaction are mixed but interesting. Whatever you believe, is there an amount of evidence that would change your mind? I walked away from organized religion at age 13 and never looked back. If I am struck by a bolt of lightning and killed, it will simply be because I was unlucky.\nCan a good player win at poker? Not against other players at the same level of skill. When someone wins a big tournament, he/she is hailed as the big new talent, but no one has repeated as world champion since 1982, and the players themselves say that at the top tables it\u2019s impossible to predict the winners. These days, top players bet on each other to spread their risk.\nIs it a good idea to buy lottery tickets? No. Not because the odds are against you, but because the payoff isn\u2019t big enough to give a positive expected value. Never in history has a fair US or European lottery had good enough odds to warrant buying a ticket. They disproportionately take money from the poor. Governments should eliminate public lotteries and heavily tax private lotteries.\nAre lottery winners happier? Above a certain amount, yes, in general. Most lottery winners lead fairly similar lives to their previous lives and adjust well to their increased balance sheets. It is a myth that most big lottery winners end up penniless.\nIs Social Security in the US at risk of failing? Yes. There isn\u2019t enough money in the trust to pay future retirees. The longer we kick the problem down the road, the worse it gets. The biggest problem facing social benefits schemes around the world is the population structure* (you must click on the blue curve to see changes over time). Japan and the United States will almost certainly have to reduce benefits. People will have to work longer. In Europe, it helps to look at the incentives. In my view, Social Security wasn\u2019t such a great idea the way they implemented it (today\u2019s workers pay for today\u2019s retirees). In other countries, I don\u2019t know but am interested to learn.\nAre GMOs dangerous? In general, they are not. However, there is black-swan potential here, and public perception is quite polarized. Because you can\u2019t \u201cput them back into the bag,\u201d it makes sense to craft policies on genetically modified crops that help prevent worst-case scenarios. Keep in mind there is potential for harm without GMOs (the \u201cAlar scare\u201d was a misunderstanding followed by an aggressive media campaign, and there are \u201cbad\u201d molecules in the natural environment that haven\u2019t managed to take over the earth). In my view, applying the \u201cprecautionary principle\u201d is misguided. I think cost-benefit is a better approach. I believe we should look at each case on its own merits, and the Biofortified blog is a good source of that information.\nIF YOU HAVE NOT BEEN SKIMMING TO THIS POINT, you must have seen many examples where your \u201ccommon sense\u201d notions or \u201cthe common narrative\u201d has not held up very well to data-driven scrutiny. Now I will take that challenge up a level by presenting evidence and analysis showing that our environment is nowhere near as endangered as the press make it sound. If you have been sailing through until now, please fasten your seat belt.\nAre polar bears threatened? Not at all, polar bear numbers are up dramatically over the past few decades. Much of the increase is due to reduced hunting of the animals, which is now down to about 600\u2013800 bear-hunting permits per year. Polar bears are not threatened, they are thriving.\nAre our forests being depleted? Believe it or not, we have more green acreage now than any time in the last several thousand years.* We do need to promote biodiversity and protect intact ancient forests. This are emergencies in a few places, but overall it\u2019s not as bad as the press makes it sound.\nHow about DDT? DDT was widely vilified in the 1980s. Researchers claimed it was responsible for eggshell thinning and birth defects in raptors.* The alarm was sounded, and as a result DDT use was curtailed. That led to many more malaria deaths than we would have had if we had kept using DDT. Recent studies have shown only a tiny association with birth defects, the trade-offs are worth it to eliminate malaria, and the WHO includes DDT on the list of approved substances to kill mosquito eggs. Cost-benefit analysis is a better tactic than emotional alarms, scary imagery, and zealotry.\nWhat about the Ozone hole? It\u2019s likely that CFCs had nothing to do with the ozone hole and stopping them simply coincided with the natural reduction of the size of the \u201chole.\u201d On the other hand, the basic chemical theory is solid, but we should always ask for direct evidence, not laboratory evidence. NASA recently reported that the size of the ozone hole naturally varies a lot over decades. The ozone hole is likely to continue expanding and contracting naturally. I don\u2019t think there was ever any emergency. If you have interesting data on this, please send it to me.\nAre we losing all our insect species? We are losing many species, but it\u2019s not as bad as people think. It\u2019s not an insect apocalypse, but we should definitely take steps to limit further breakup of intact ancient forests.\nWhat about the bees? Bee colony collapse was very real in the first decade of this century. The causes were quite complex, involving many factors, but it only lasted a few years. Colonies routinely loose bees in winter; beekeepers have many options for restoring colony numbers in summer. In general, colony collapse disorder was overblown in the media. Bee numbers have been predictably steady for decades.\nShould cities or states ban the use of plastic bags? If the replacement is paper bags: no; if the replacement is cloth bags people keep and reuse over and over: yes. How do you know which bags people will use? Soon, we will have algae and other organic-based plastic substitutes that will degrade gracefully.\nShould we recycle plastic bottles? It\u2019s complicated. There are a lot of variables. Many cities find it unprofitable. When the economics work, they don\u2019t get turned into new bottles, they get turned into carpet fibers. We should reduce our need for one-time bottles, but in many cases, landfill may be the best place for them.\nShould we recycle glass bottles? If it is put into concrete products, yes. If the colors are separated and your city is far from a coast, yes (Switzerland recycles three colors of glass profitably). If it is mixed, it isn\u2019t going to become glass again in most cases, because sand is cheaper. That could change as sand prices rise. My guess is that a lot of cities run unprofitable recycling programs just so they can be seen as green. I need more data to understand this better.\nShould we recycle paper? I don\u2019t know. I can\u2019t find any good studies on this. I\u2019m guessing it has to do with how far away you live from a large forest. Please send me any data!\nShould we recycle aluminum? It takes a lot more energy to mine and refine aluminum than it does to recycle it, so I thought there would be good empirical evidence on recycling economics. Even though about half of all aluminum is recycled, I can\u2019t find an empirical analysis. Can you?\nIs plastic and garbage polluting our oceans, killing all the marine life? No, not as much as you might think, there are no floating acres of plastic out at sea, no huge garbage patch, and the plastic found in the ocean is largely under 2mm in diameter (very small pieces) or microscopic. Half the plastic found in the oceans is floating fishing line and nets, but the amount overall is trending up. Despite the fact that our oceans are remarkably resilient, we still should try to reduce the flow of plastics into them.\nAre we destroying fishing stocks by overfishing? Yes. We are removing and eating the predators. This is changing the balance of life in the oceans. A battle between fishermen and lawmakers is a battle the fishermen will first win, then lose. Humans will remove almost all predatory fish in the next several decades, reducing biodiversity and causing further knock-on effects. In reality, there will be plenty of fish in the future, but they will be small fish, not the fish we eat today, and that will change our oceans profoundly. I\u2019m generally not concerned with most environmental alarms, but this one keeps me up at night.\nIs wind power effective? In reality, there\u2019s no such thing as wind power. There is only wind plus whatever you use to back it up when the wind doesn\u2019t blow. Therefore, you have to compare wind plus existing power and factor in subsidies and upcoming rule changes (like California\u2019s commitment to eliminate fossil fuels by 2030). Today, about six percent of world energy comes from wind, much of it heavily subsidized. Some places, like the UK, already have a lot of wind power and are probably starting to see diminishing returns. Other windy places with expensive energy will still benefit, and offshore wind farms are looking particularly unprofitable. Without continued subsidies, today\u2019s wind technology, which is getting close to the Betz limit in efficiency, is unlikely to bring much value to the energy market (see table 4). Electricity costs are higher in places with more wind farms, because their stable energy sources run much less efficiently. There are problems with birds, wildlife, noise, human deaths, long-distance electric lines, and alternative uses for the land. The viability of wind also depends on storage costs coming down, because wind power doesn\u2019t peak during the middle of the day, when demand is high, as solar does. Forcing wind power to be competitive with other sources will result in wind power where it truly works.\nIs solar power the energy of the future? Solar power has much more promise than wind, because you can convert sunlight on your roof into energy to run your house. As prices come down and efficiency goes up, solar is definitely a smart source of power. We still need traditional power sources for cloudy days. In reality, electricity prices where there is a lot of solar are still higher than in the rest of the country because power plants are not designed to run as back-up generators. It makes sense to keep investing to make solar more effective, but it is not a full-time replacement for traditional power.\nDoes my electric car run on fossil fuel? In reality, it probably does. If your electricity comes from a coal-fired power plant (30 percent of US power) or from natural gas (34 percent), then yes, your eco-car runs on fossil fuel.\nWhat about nuclear power? I believe nuclear power is the future. Fourth-generation reactors are safe, eat nuclear waste as fuel, and are coming down in size and price. Today\u2019s nuclear power provides a reasonable trade-off against fossil fuels. Within 30 years it\u2019s about 50 percent likely that we\u2019ll have fusion power. If that happens, we\u2019ll have unlimited clean power for almost no money. The technical term for that is \u201cfoom.\u201d\nIs the planet warming as a result of man? There is certainly a lot of consensus that extra CO2 is warming the earth, and I understand if you are reading this and believe it is true. But, as we have seen so many times previously, I think it\u2019s worth challenging this common belief. How much of the data have you actually looked at? I spent a year on this topic looking at thousands of graphs and reading thousands of papers, and after about six months I changed my mind. What would it take to change yours? In the last 50 years, we had 30 years of warming followed by 20 years of no warming.* Model predictions of future temperatures are both flawed and much less precise than their creators would like us to believe. The earth hasn\u2019t warmed significantly in the past 20 years,* defying model estimates. The debate is so political that it\u2019s very difficult to discover the truth and the uncertainties. Research and data are highly skewed. IPCCC reports are politically driven. Did you know there are PhD\u2019ed climate scientists who have quit the UN working groups and do not agree with the \u201cconsensus\u201d? In reality, all the decarbonization we can do will have very little impact anyway. If you really want to understand this issue, please read Climatecurious.com.* If, after reading all the links in this paragraph, you still believe we have something to worry about, I will respect that view. And, I\u2019ll be interested to bet on an outcome you can specify in the next ten years that proves your view correct.\nIs sea level going to accelerate and threaten coastal cities? Sea level has been rising linearly roughly 7\u201310 inches (18\u201325 cm) per century for the past two centuries (long before CO2 started to increase). It continues in a linear fashion, even since the increase of CO2. This is heavily complicated by the fact that tide gauges are highly variable, land naturally sinks, and groundwater extraction causes land to sink further. In reality, impactful sea-level rise of more than 15\" by the end of this century is so unlikely that it\u2019s not worth preparing for on a cost/benefit basis. Dr Judith Curry has a careful evaluation of the evidence.*\nAre reefs turning acidic and dying because of CO2 in the atmosphere? I don\u2019t think they are. They die after El-Nino events, then they come back. They have been doing this for hundreds of millions of years, long before we got here. The thermal threshold for corals varies, and new corals easily replace old corals. There is good evidence that reefs are very resilient to temperature changes and routinely bounce back from shocks. The \u201cscientific\u201d research showing bleaching is heavily skewed by politics and the common myth of future climate change. (Sunscreen may play a role in destroying corals, but they are resilient creatures). More at climatecurious.com.*\nAre duck and goose down products sustainable? Many manufacturers now adhere to \u201cethical down\u201d practices. The National Sanitation Foundation has created their Global Traceable Down standard or Responsible Down, which means gathering down that falls naturally from geese or plucking after geese are killed for their meat (excluding force-fed). Many major brands now are certified under one of these programs. It makes sense to look for those labels.\nIN REALITY, THE WORLD IS FAR MORE DIFFICULT TO UNDERSTAND THAN MOST PEOPLE THINK. Here I offer a few principles to better align your own map with the territory.\nCorrelation is not causation. Now that even high-school kids are saying this, it seems trite. But it\u2019s more true than ever. There are a lot of correlations, many of them spectacular. We understand very little about causation.\nFacts are not evidence. Facts are everywhere, you can use them to justify anything. Evidence is everything \u2014 you must take the facts you don\u2019t like along with the facts you like. My video series explains this.\nMost scientific research is wrong. As Laura Arnold says, the four most dangerous words are \u201cA new study says ...\u201d. If you didn\u2019t watch Derek\u2019s video above, please go back up and watch it now. The rest is in this book, which I highly recommend (it\u2019s linked in the resources section):\nComplex adaptive systems are not the same as complex systems. A complex system would be tectonic plates moving and causing earthquakes, or a famous experiment about grains of sand piling up and slipping. Those systems don\u2019t continually evolve and learn. In a complex adaptive system, what worked last time won\u2019t necessarily work next time.\nEcosystems are complex adaptive systems. Ecosystems are characterized by:\nHundreds of simultaneous arms races, many of which are invisible Auctions, in which people make irrational, emotional choices Beauty contests with winner-take-all economics Moving, even elusive targets Black-swan events, unprecedented surprises from unknown unknowns Implicit games with unwritten rules People gaming the system Others pre-gaming and re-gaming the system in response Lots of data, signals, statistics, information, and numbers  Solutions that are temporary at best Adversaries and allies, many of whom are difficult to distinguish The fast rise of new frontiers Sudden death Uncertainty, ambiguity, and volatility = the red-queen effect\nMost signals are weak. This is an understatement. We continually learn that what we thought we knew was really just a misreading of the available information. We thought a low-salt diet was good. Now we think that a bit more salt is good for you.* Serious analysis shows that most antidepressants are better than nothing, but not a lot better.* Prevailing beliefs are often based on small signals with large margins of error.\nDoctors really don\u2019t know much. Studies show that doctors are overconfident, they are as susceptible to bias as anyone else, they often screw up patient diagnoses, many of them don\u2019t keep up with the literature in their field, most can\u2019t do basic Bayesian reasoning, they don\u2019t wash their hands, and using simple checklists saves many lives. I certainly know some very smart doctors who understand all of this and are very good at statistics. Smart doctors say \u201cI don\u2019t know\u201d or \u201cit\u2019s complicated\u201d more often than other doctors do. If you have a serious medical decision to make, always consult a qualified (not certified) statistician.\nCause and effect are extremely difficult to determine. Complex adaptive systems are black boxes with inputs and outputs \u2014 don\u2019t assume you understand the mechanism, because even thinking in terms of \u201cmechanism\u201d is wrong. Statisticians understand the world better, because they understand variance and uncertainty. Economists try to see the big picture.\nPrediction markets are the best way to forecast the future. In complex adaptive systems, experts\u2019 opinions aren\u2019t very useful. Prediction markets have already proven themselves as excellent predictors, because people must put up their own money, and if they are wrong, someone else profits. Having skin in the game is the best way to get accurate forecasts. They can help inform policy, set monetary policy, colonize space, and much more. Unfortunately, most countries see these information markets as gambling and have outlawed them. This needs serious reform.\nEmpiricism is being open and neutral to changing your mind when you learn new facts or see new data.\nAll models are wrong; some models are useful. Nothing is perfect. We make decisions using very limited information. Yet limited information is better than no information. If your model isn\u2019t improving over time, you\u2019re probably not putting enough work into maintaining your tools.\nMyths are stubborn. I\u2019ve pointed out a few myths here, and there are many more. Once an idea gets momentum, it\u2019s hard to stop. This is why I\u2019m generally against learning from textbooks. I think if you want to become knowledgeable about a topic, it would be better to read ten different books than one textbook. Be wary of statements like \u201c97 percent of scientists agree\u201d \u2014 that\u2019s a sign that someone is trying to sell something.\nDon\u2019t get a medical test unless you would be willing to make a change. People often get tests \u201cto establish a baseline,\u201d and this is generally useless. Before you take any test, ask yourself if you are willing to treat if positive and not treat if negative. If you are unwilling to treat, don\u2019t test.\nMost people are not statistically literate, including scientists, researchers, doctors, lawyers, judges, politicians, boards, and others who make rules and decisions. Anyone who has taken a few courses in statistics is dangerously overconfident. Start with the Marginal University course on econometrics, then dive into Khan Academy and read the books in the list below.\nMost science is junk science. Most scientists are not strong statisticians. We have seen that even well trained statisticians can do a poor job of randomization. Given that most scientific research results are false, we should assume most science is junk science and be pleasantly surprised when an experiment is actually properly designed with enough statistical power to be worth conducting in the first place (and not designed a-priori to show a particular result that the funder would like to see).\nThe world isn\u2019t black and white. There are rarely any concrete answers, context matters, details matter. There is always a continuum of possibilities and outcomes. Cost-benefit analysis is a better tool than rhetoric and cherry-picking the facts to suit the outcome you want.\nCognitive biases affect all of us, even those of us who study cognitive biases. Read Nassim Taleb to get ahead of them. Or let Robin break it down:\nScientists try to disprove their theories. They know that almost all theories are later replaced by something better. A good scientist will actively try to disprove her theory. There may be heated debate about a topic for some time (evolution, germs, smoking), but then we all learn more and science moves forward. Should we think of it as \u201cdebate\u201d or as \u201clearning together?\u201d\nIt\u2019s okay to be wrong. In my experience, at least 90 percent of people, when confronted with evidence that they are wrong, tend to not want to hear any more. They change the topic quickly or defend themselves. Only a small number of people want to learn what went wrong. Expect most people you encounter to be the first type but try to hang out with the second type.\nIt\u2019s okay to be surprised. People generally don\u2019t want to be surprised. If they think a particular explanation would be surprising, they tend to rule it out and look for less surprising narratives. Reading Randomistas will show you that surprise is the norm. If you are not surprised, you are probably not looking very hard.\nAnecdotes do not generalize. How many books are there on management using examples of wolves, military, sports teams, and other nonsense? Storytellers easily convince their audiences that this particular story applies to you today. That\u2019s what they think at Harvard Business school,* which produces graduates who are overconfident because they have read and discussed hundreds of stories. This leads us to differential diagnoses* \u2014 different people, economies, and countries need different solutions. One size does not fit all.\nWhat would it take to change your mind? This is a big question among rationalists. You should be able to say ahead of time what it would take and then look for it. If you find it, don\u2019t move the goal posts!\nHow much would you be willing to bet? This is a Bayesian measure of your belief in something. You may be 90 percent sure of something, but would you be willing to bet 90 percent of your assets on being right? How much would you be willing to bet? Bayesians never agree to disagree. In this introduction to Bayesian reasoning, take a quick test and see how well you do:\nYou should never be 100 percent confident of anything. That means you would bet your life on it, and that\u2019s foolish. In fact, confidence should be nonlinear \u2014 it should take more and more evidence to move you one percent of the way toward \u201cknowing something for sure\u201d the closer you get to believing it. Never discount the possibility of unknown unknowns.\nContext and details matter. Rationalists often say \u201cI think you\u2019ll find it\u2019s a little more complicated than that.\u201d ITYFIALMCTT for short. Every time we think we have discovered a \u201crule,\u201d it turns out to be a pretty complex set of rules that apply in some situations but not in others. Alfred Sloane famously said in a board meeting:\nVariance is remarkably common and little appreciated. Complex adaptive systems have variance and uncertainty in several dimensions. Variance is often interpreted as signal, but variance is not signal, it\u2019s noise. Statisticians ask: \u201cHow likely is it that this result is simply due to chance?\u201d Danny Kahneman has recently been writing and talking about this.\nMeta-studies are important. Not all metastudies are well done or statistically powerful. The rest probably summarize the best of our knowledge at any one time, though there are limits to their power. Meta-studies are done by statisticians. If you find a recent meta-study, you have to take it seriously. To find them, try the Cochrane Library and search Google Scholar for a search term with the words \u201cmeta analysis\u201d added at the end.\nLarge, randomly controlled trials are important, but many are poorly designed. You need a proper control, which many studies don\u2019t have, and you need double blinding whenever possible. The PREDIMED study, which made fantastic claims about the health effects of olive oil, was huge and highly regarded, until it was discovered that they had made significant mistakes in the design of the study. The benefits are likely significant but less than the original claims.* A weight-loss study that provides data at six months is meaningless, but one that shows results after two years would be a breakthrough. The Million Women study results are important. Yet randomization is harder than we thought.\nGenetics are important. I expect human and microbial genetics will change many of today\u2019s dominant paradigms in medicine, health, nutrition, and much more. Our treatments will get more and more nuanced, more individualized,* more targeted. What works for one person doesn\u2019t work for another. This goes for cities, countries, cultures, and societies.\nAnecdotes make for good hunches, not conclusions. If researchers find something they think is worth investigating, they formulate a hypothesis, try to design a statistically powerful study, determine feasibility (often they have to do a small trial study first), then pass the ethics board, put a budget together, find unbiased money to fund it, then report their unbiased data, findings, and confidence intervals. Then someone else needs to get the funding to verify those findings independently, using the same methods. At the end of all that, they usually find \u201cno correlation.\u201d Occasionally they find a few weak signals and \u201cmore research is needed.\u201d Research is like mining for gold \u2014 few people hit anything big in a lifetime of digging. Resilience matters.\nDestination is more important than instrumentation. How do we know coral reefs will all be destroyed by global warming? Scientists do tank experiments, where they raise the water a few degrees. They then release their findings to the news wire, claiming the oceans will all be death zones in a few decades (which the press eats like cake pops). In reality, that\u2019s not how oceans work. Reef temperatures have been changing (variance) for hundreds of millions of years, and corals have been adapting, dying, and regenerating for just as long. Lab experiments can only give us hunches to test in the real world. Don\u2019t look at instrumental variables like triglycerides and biomarkers \u2014 look at endpoints like heart attacks, strokes, and deaths. Don\u2019t look at arrests or jail time, look at the measurable cost/benefit to society. Similarly, there is no need to count calories, wear a device that measures your activity, or look at a bathroom scale. If your goal is to lose weight, look in the mirror to see your results.\nIt\u2019s not always about data. You want to get whatever data you can, but sometimes can\u2019t or it isn\u2019t very good. I can\u2019t present any data on abortion that will change anyone\u2019s mind. Abortion is only about values. We have almost no data on what causes people to live longer, because it takes too long to do the experiment. This also appears in extreme value theory, where there aren\u2019t enough events in the past to predict the future. Conflicting data is something else. When you see conflicting data, you are obliged to try to figure out why it conflicts and make sense of it \u2014 you can\u2019t write it off as \u201cself canceling.\u201d As Andrew Leigh says, \u201cIf you want to know about the impact of denuclearization on the Korean peninsula, a randomized trial is probably not your best way of working it out.\u201d\nSystems beat individual judgment. Forget about goals, forget about talent. Stop trying to keep everything in your head. This video explains how Scott Adams used a system to beat the system.* At Menlo Innovations, they use a system to do all their project management.* In fact, systems are replacing project managers around the world.\nSkeptics tend to be right most of the time, but optimists move the world forward. Alternate between the two. The Apollo program was a remarkable see-saw between huge audacious goals and pragmatic prototyping, testing, and failure. Same with the Wright Brothers. This ability to make grand leaps but let the experimental evidence lead you forward is a hallmark of many big successful projects. To understand the world, be about 70 percent skeptic, 30 percent open to new ideas.\nTrial and error is a remarkably good strategy. We call it \u201cexplore and exploit.\u201d Imagine if I ran for president and said, in answer to any question, \u201cI\u2019m really not sure, I would want to do randomly controlled trials and see where they lead.\u201d Do you think I would get elected? Maybe not, but I\u2019m an atheist, so there\u2019s no chance anyway. It may not get you elected, but it\u2019s good advice for you in your business and in your life.* To optimize your engagement with the world, make trial and error your normal procedure.\nStory telling is a power tool. Use it carefully. Watch Shane Snow explain it, but keep in mind it is being used against you all day. Tyler Cowen says we should be suspicious of storytelling:\nHold strong opinions loosely. I learned this from Doug Hubbard after reading his books. I\u2019ve gotten better at saying \u201cI don\u2019t know, what can we learn?\u201d When talking with experts, I\u2019m never surprised to hear: \u201cI think you\u2019ll find it\u2019s a little more complicated than that.\u201d\nThinking Fast and Slow (beginner), by Danny KahnemanFactfulness (beginner), by Hans RoslingMindware (beginner), by Richard NisbettWrong (beginner), by David FreedmanPull (beginner), by David SiegelThe Elephant in the Brain (beginner), by Kevin Simler and Robin HansonThe Black Swan (intermediate), Skin in the Game (intermediate), and Antifragile (advanced) by Nicholas Nassim TalebUncontrolled: The Surprising Payoff of Trial-and-Error for Business, Politics, and Society (intermediate)\u2014 Jim ManziRadical Markets (intermediate), by Weyl and PosnerThe Case Against Education (intermediate), by Bryan CaplanRandomistas (intermediate), by Andrew LeighStatistics Done Wrong (advanced), by Alex ReinhartStubborn Attachments (intermediate), by Tyler CowenHow to Measure Anything (intermediate), by Douglas HubbardExpert Political Judgment (intermediate), by Philip TetlockPrinciples (beginner), by Ray DalioThe Rational Optimist: How Prosperity Evolves (intermediate), by Matt RidleyShut Out: How a Housing Shortage Caused the Great Recession and Crippled Our Economy (advanced), by Kevin ErdmannThe Flaw of Averages (advanced), by Sam SavageInadequate Equilibria (advanced), by Eliezer YudkowskyRationality, from AI to Zombies (advanced), by Eliezer YudkowskyThe Checklist Manifesto(intermediate), by Atul Gawande\nUptodate.comCochrane LibraryGoogle ScholarPlosOneDebate.orgRetraction WatchEcontalk.orgCloserToTruth\nDavid Siegel Business Agility seriesKhan AcademyMarginal UniversityVeritasiumTony Heller\nThe Money Illusion \u2014 Scott SumnerMacro Musings \u2014 David BeckworthEssays by David SiegelThe Rational Optimist \u2014 Matt RidleyMarginal Revolution \u2014 Tyler CowenOvercoming Bias \u2014 Robin HansonIdiosyncratic Whisk \u2014 Kevin ErdmannSlate Star Codex \u2014 Scott AlexanderCrooked Timber \u2014 VariousSciencebasedmedicine.org \u2014 Steve Novella et al.

I got a bone scan and learned that I have osteoporosis, which is extreme for someone in his 50s who is as sporty as I am. My doctor prescribed Fosamax, which I learned is not for active people (I\u2019m not convinced it benefits anyone, but it may help frail elderly people).\nThere is no correlation between being vegan and fractures, but there is a small amount of data on older people with low-protein diets having thinner bones and breaking them. According to that study, increasing the protein helped that population prevent further fractures. This isn\u2019t much to go on, but it\u2019s more than I had before. I\u2019ve decided to stay vegan and increase my protein intake. In a few years, I may then go for another bone scan to see if it has made any difference (or not \u2014 you only take a test if you would do something different depending on the outcome of a test, remember?). Since we know so little about men in their 50s and osteoporosis, I\u2019m doing an experiment where the number of subjects (n) equals 1. Very few people eat a low-protein diet. Adding plant protein to my diet isn\u2019t difficult. I will be interested to see the results (if any).\nFor the record, I also take B-12 tablets, not because I really think I need them but because they are delicious and it doesn\u2019t hurt. I know there are recommendations that vegans require extra B-12, but I believe the evidence for that is very weak. In general, I don\u2019t think vegans need any special supplements, but I do hope we learn more in the coming years.\nWhat do I worry about? Mostly, I worry about overconfidence, statistical ignorance, and rigorous nonsense, which divert resources to made-up problems like global warming, regulation, and going to Mars. I worry about people focusing on near-term problems like tax rates and minimum wage, rather than big important problems, like maximizing the rate of sustainable economic growth. I worry that most of our institutions are optimized for the world we had back in 1950.* I worry about the poverty trap, the health care system, our political systems, central banks causing recessions, not investing in nuclear power, the signaling economy, social safety nets, the slow pace of innovation, and the future of humanity in an AI/robot/brain-emulation world (after 2050). I worry that children born today will go through a school system designed for the industrial age. I worry about the fact that banking, insurance, and other industries are held back by rules and structures from the last century, when we now have technology that can replace those structures. I worry that $13 trillion of impact investments don\u2019t have much impact. I worry that the playing field is designed for huge companies to get bigger and that makes us all vulnerable.* I worry about cybercrime and invasion of privacy \u2014 not just from criminals but from governments like the United States, Russia, and China. The more connected we become, the easier it is for them to discover and exploit vulnerabilities. When I have a spare moment, I worry about overfishing, antibiotic resistance, and dietary ignorance.\nMostly, though, I don\u2019t worry. I\u2019m glad things are generally improving, they aren\u2019t as bad as people think, and we are naturally finding solutions to many big problems. Even though the gap between rich and poor is widening, the poor are much better off than they were 20 years ago. The more connected we become, the faster ideas spread.\nIn my research, I have been most impressed by the Laura and John Arnold Foundation. They are fighting the right battles. I hope they can scale up their model to meet the needs of the entire world. Aside from the Arnolds, I\u2019m shocked at how much money wealthy people waste on frivolous \u201csave the world\u201d projects without understanding the real problems first. It seems like philanthropy is mostly virtuous signaling. I\u2019m not surprised at all how bad we are at trying to help people who are less fortunate. I just wish it weren\u2019t that way, because it doesn\u2019t have to be.\nI will continue to do research on these and many other topics. My main hope is that you\u2019ve enjoyed reading this as much as I\u2019ve enjoyed researching and writing it. My second hope is that someone will want to help turn this into something much bigger.\nIf you learn to look at the world this way, I think you\u2019ll find it\u2019s a little more complicated than you thought before. And that might help the next generation of problem solvers make the world a better place.\nMy thanks to: Kevin Dick, Rob Siegel, Scott Sumner, Kevin Erdmann, Satish Luintel, and Mike.\nIf you want to contact me because you have corrections, can fill gaps in my knowledge, want to show me evidence or analysis, or you would like to discuss taking this work to the wider world, or join our small team of research volunteers, please email me (david at dsiegel dot com).

Doctors who visited Assange in the Ecuadorian Embassy have attested that he urgently needs medical care. Belmarsh is a maximum security prison sometimes referred to as \u201cthe UK\u2019s Guantanamo Bay\u201d.\nAnd yet we\u2019re asked to believe that this has something to do with an alleged bail violation and a US extradition request for alleged computer crimes carrying a maximum sentence of five years. If you zoom out and listen to the less-informed chatter of the overt propagandists and the brainwashed rank-and-file western mass media consumers, you will also see that people believe this has something to do with Russia and rape allegations as well.\nActually, none of these things are true. Assange is being imprisoned under draconian conditions for journalism, and for journalism only. The Obama administration declined to prosecute him after WikiLeaks\u2019 publication of the Manning leaks out of concern that doing so would endanger press freedoms, and the Obama administration didn\u2019t have any more evidence at its disposal than the Trump administration has now. The \u201ccrime\u201d Assange is accused of consists of nothing other than standard journalistic practices that investigative journalists engage in all the time, including source protection and encouraging the source to obtain more material. The only thing that has changed is an increased willingness in the White House to prosecute journalists for practicing journalism, and there are an abundance of reasons to believe that he will be hit with far more serious charges once extradited to US soil. They\u2019re not going to all this trouble for a bail violation and a five-year maximum sentence.\nBut if you zoom out even further, in the grand scheme of things this barely even has anything to do with Assange. Sure, he has of course been a thorn in the side of those who operate the transnational western power alliance, and given the choice they would of course prefer him to be locked up or dead than free and alive. But that\u2019s not what the corrupt influencers who are strangling our world are shooting for here. They are making a grab for something much, much bigger. Assange just happens to be a stepping stone along the way.\nAs we\u2019ve discussed previously, the prosecution of Assange is really designed to set a legal precedent which will enable the US government to imprison journalists for trying to hold it to account using journalism. The reason you are seeing the phrase \u201cAssange is not a journalist\u201d bleated constantly by empire lackeys all around the world today is because they need a counter-narrative for the indisputable fact that this precedent poses a threat to journalists around the world, the argument being that since Assange isn\u2019t a journalist (pure bullshit by the way), this isn\u2019t setting a precedent for journalists. As though their personal definition of what a \u201creal journalist\u201d is will be the one used by the US government when determining whether or not to prosecute other people for doing things similar to what Assange did, instead of whatever definition happens to suit US government agendas in that instance.\nBut in order to get the really, really big picture perspective of what these bastards are going for, we need to zoom out even further than that.\nIn the sci-fi novel Ender\u2019s Game, the young protagonist applies a vicious beating to one of his bullies, killing him. When asked why he did this by his handlers, the boy, who has been bred and raised to become a strategic savant, explains that he did it not out of malice toward the bully, nor only to win the fight, but to win all future fights as well. If the kids at school see what savagery he\u2019s capable of and know he\u2019s not to be trifled with, he won\u2019t ever have to fight them.\nIf this sounds a bit sociopathic to you, that\u2019s because it is. And, with the notable difference of the bully and victim roles being reversed, this is exactly the principle we are seeing exercised with Assange.\nThe entire world is watching what is being done to Assange currently. No matter how propagandized you are, no matter how much you hate the man personally, you\u2019re watching that happen and learning a lesson from it. And that lesson is, never do anything remotely like what that guy did, or you\u2019ll meet the same fate. This is the real goal of Assange\u2019s persecution, and it doesn\u2019t impact merely one Australian publisher in a UK jail cell, nor even merely the investigative journalists around the world who are interested in practicing the lost art of holding power to account using journalism, but everyone in the world who consumes news media.\nAnd it works. I know it works because it works on me. I\u2019ll say right here and now, if you\u2019ve got information that incriminates the most powerful people in the world, keep it the hell away from me. Give it to someone else, literally anyone else, because I myself am far too cowardly and have far too much to lose by getting involved in anything that could lead to me rotting in some overseas prison cell. I\u2019ve got kids. I\u2019m in love. I cannot and will not go down that path. And if this is true for me I know for certain that it\u2019s true for countless others as well. They\u2019ve brutalized whistleblowers to the point that it\u2019s surely had a severe chilling effect on those who would otherwise become key leak sources, and now they\u2019re brutalizing the journalists who publish those leaks as well. The odds of someone willing to blow the whistle on real power meeting a journalist who is willing to help them are rapidly diminishing to zero.\nThey\u2019re trying to win this fight against Assange in brutal fashion to ensure that they win all future fights as well.\nWhich is why it\u2019s absolutely stupid that this conversation so often gets fixated on Assange the man, whether it\u2019s smears or praise.\nThe other day I published a massive mega-article attacking the major smears about Assange I\u2019ve encountered. There are 27 of them in total so far, and I\u2019ll be adding more soon. This mountain of smears exists because instead of paying attention to the world-shaping dangers I just outlined which threaten to make it impossible to oppose the leaders of the US-centralized empire who are marching us towards either extinction or dystopia, people are babbling about Assange\u2019s personality, or whether or not he cleaned up after his cat while at the embassy.\nThe flip side of this is people who fixate on Assange as a hero, which can of course help draw attention to his plight and therefore be of some benefit, but ultimately that\u2019s also missing the forest for the trees. This is so very, very much bigger than Assange, and we need to oppose it for reasons that are far, far more significant than the individual characteristics of one man who, depending on what we\u2019ve heard, we may or may not believe is a nice person.\nNever lose sight of this: the intimidation of whistleblowers and leak publishers threatens to stop truth from informing the behaviors of our entire species, leaving only the whims of the most powerful to decide our fate. The most powerful people are those most dedicated to pursuing power, those sociopathic enough to step on anyone\u2019s head and do whatever it takes to secure as much control as possible over as many humans as possible. That\u2019s who we\u2019re handing the steering wheel of our world to if we allow truth to be intimidated into silence.\nAnd never lose sight of this, either: with the imprisonment and prosecution of Julian Assange, these same sociopathic oppressors have exposed themselves. They have ripped off the friendly Big Brother mask and exposed the dark infernal entities which squirm and hiss underneath. This sudden interest in the legal technicalities of bail protocol and journalistic source protection protocol happen to look exactly the same as prosecuting a journalist for publishing facts because that is exactly what is happening. Don\u2019t ever let anyone gaslight you into believing otherwise, and don\u2019t you dare miss this rare opportunity to point out to your fellow humans how our oppressors have revealed their true nature.\n______________________\nEveryone has my unconditional permission to republish or use any part of this work (or anything else I\u2019ve written) in any way they like free of charge.

Because I wrote daily, the posts have become, in effect, a humorous chronological history of Trumplethinskin\u2019s foibles and failures.\nMy audience and my following grew over time. At one point, I was getting 10,000 to 20,000 readers a day. In June of last year, a post I wrote went viral, getting more than 1.5 million views.\nIronically, it was that same post, one that included the name of a Fox News executive and attracted the attention of Fox lawyers, as well as press attention, that might have marked the beginning of the end.\nWithin a week, Facebook, from where most of my downstream traffic was generated, blocked my posts, effectively keeping them from gaining audience and traction. FB called my satire \u201cfake news.\u201d\nMedium, in turn, failed to get my posts, which are very topical and time-sensitive, to my followers on the day they were written. Now most of my 17,000 followers don\u2019t receive them for weeks after they post, sometimes never. And, now, instead of as many as 20,000 readers in a day, I\u2019m getting no more than a couple hundred.\nOn top of all that, Donald Chump has effectively killed satire, as was outlined in Justin Smith\u2019s article in the New York Times last week. While an old and venerable form of political resistance, satire is no longer viable or effective in this age of Trump\u2019s obfuscating tweets and social media misdirection, according to Smith. Donald Trump\u2019s labeling of all criticism as fake news has rendered today\u2019s attempts at satire \u201cfutile.\u201d\nAll of this is discouraging, but most disheartening is that Donald Trump is still in office, still doing daily damage, and still eroding the foundations of our democracy. And with AG William Barr now running interference for him, defanging the Mueller Report, Benedict Donald\u2019s destructive presidency will probably get worse before we get rid of him.\nUnfortunately, the 2020 Democratic hopefuls, before they\u2019ve even left the starting gate, seem determined to nip at each other until they render themselves harmless competition for Trump. I\u2019m losing confidence now that there is a Democrat in the field who can dethrone Boss Tweet in the next election.\nYes, I\u2019m thoroughly disgusted. And since it\u2019s Easter, heralding the season of renewal and rebirth, I\u2019m choosing to make a fresh start by no longer making making the moron in the White House my whipping boy.\nSo, today is my last satirical post about Donald Chump. At least my last regular one. From time to time, as I get inspired, I\u2019ll find my funny bone again, but I no longer want to wade into Trump\u2019s swamp with him on a daily basis. I\u2019ll write about other things that I find funny. And that I hope you will, too.\nBig shout out to David Smooke at Extranewsfeed, who has picked up my posts every day and put me on the map.\nAnd thanks especially to those who have followed me almost from day one, supporting my efforts with claps and comments and frequent words of encouragement.

Peterson \u2013 Erlend Kulander Kvitrud \u2013 Medium", "num_comments": "unspecified", "tags": ["philosophy", "society", "culture", "politics", "media"], "reading_time": 9, "text": "Before diving into the belly of this whale of a botched discrediting-campaign, let me start by outlining what I hope to salvage.\nAs inheritors of the western philosophical tradition, we stand on the shoulders of small-minded bigots. Plato advocated the death penalty for those who disagreed with his theological stance. Aristotle was a misogynic racist, touting the virtues of slavery. Thomas Aquinas was a homophobe. Immanuel Kant and David Hume were white supremacists. Martin Heidegger was a bonafide National Socialist and a personal acquaintance of Adolf Hitler. Etc. The list goes on and on.\nAgainst this daunting backdrop, one might expect a professor of psychology, mostly just urging his students to grow up and accept responsibility for their lives, to be welcomed as a breath of fresh air. Regardless of said professors eccentric concern about unorthodox gender pronouns being a slippery slope to the collapse of western civilization.\nAs we all know, this was not the case.\nThis brings us to the \u00abLindsay Shepherd incident\u00bb: The Wilfrid Laurier University teaching assistant who made international headlines when she leaked a secret recording of her supervisors lamenting the decision to introduce her class to Dr. Peterson, as the moral equivalent of Nazi sympathizing. As the recording went viral, the university was forced to eat dirt and apologize to miss Shepherd, while Dr. Peterson landed his infamous interview with British Channel 4. The rest is history.\nConsider for a moment what the response would be, had miss Shepherd instead introduced her class to one of the canonized, dead bigots, listed a few paragraphs ago. Consider the lack of disciplinary action, student protests and scorn from her peers. If we were serious about wanting to shield students from thinkers of offensive thoughts, we might as well shut down every history of ideas course. Yet, despite their flaws, both as thinkers and as human beings, we tend to give dead bigots a free pass. Giving a lecture on Aristotle\u2019s Poetics is not an endorsement of sexism or slavery, and everyone gets that.\nSomehow, this attitude is reserved for the dead. Contemporary thinkers whose viewpoints are slightly off, receives harsher criticism than dead thinkers whose viewpoints were absolutely detestable. As if death somehow purged the bigotry from their thoughts. One may argue that poking the dead accomplishes nothing. Their arcane arguments were directed at worlds, long gone. They no longer hold any power to corrupt our youth. Dr. Peterson, on the other hand, is perceived as a real danger \u2014 the proverbial bull in our china shop of fragile civil rights, demanding his right to stomp about freely, to the horror of the liberal elite.\nMisreading Dr. Peterson as just another alt-right provocateur, liberal pundits set out to expose him as sutch. Planning to farm some cheap clicks and shares, they covered him with journalistic standards resembling a Russian troll farm. Time and again, Dr. Peterson parried their attempts to twist his words into bigotry. Each time, exposing their insincerity.\nThe creatures lurking in the shadows of the web followed the spectacle with amusement. Those inclined to distrust mainstream media, saw their bias confirmed. Those fed up with political correctness, heard their misgivings crystalized. They flocked to Dr. Peterson.\nThe efforts made by pundits like Laurie Penny, to belittle Dr. Peterson\u2019s fans as spoiled and self-entitled child-men, desperate to intellectualize their pathetic little male identity crisis \u2014 was never going to accomplish anything. It might score some cheap applause from her fellow ideological tribesmen, but it\u2019s no way to start a dialogue or mend divides.\nSure, it\u2019s fun to ridicule this crowd, but if make-pretending to symbolically slay the great mother-dragon of chaos is what it takes to motivate certain guys to tidy up, and become more productive members of society, so be it. Whatever works.\nDismissing men\u2019s emotional and existential issues as \u00abangry white male entitlement\u00bb is dehumanizing. It also sidesteps the fact that men are overrepresented, not just at the top of the social hierarchy, but also at the bottom. Not just in the corner offices and corridors of power, but also in prisons, among the homeless and on suicide statistics. It\u2019s not just, as Dr. Peterson points out, that \u201cno one cares about the men who fail\u201d. Caring for them is even seen as suspect. As if helping driftless, young men get their lives back on track implies some kind of red-pilled embrace of patriarchy, while in fact it\u2019s a great public service.\nDon\u2019t get me wrong. Most of the criticism Dr. Peterson recieves is well deserved. His claims are often pseudo-scientific or contemptuous or paranoid or just good old flame bait. Often in combinations of several of those things.\nWhat I take issue with is how his critics went about criticizing him. By and large they lacked, not just in intellectual integrity, but also in political savvy. They bolstered, rather than tainted, his stature as a philosopher of the disenchanted.\nEquality of outcome, aka the \u201cmurderous equity doctrine of leftists\u00bb, might be Dr. Petersons most peculiar target. Despite the fact that hardly any real-world leftists promotes complete equality of outcome (but rather a modest reduction of inequality), he grabs any opportunity to knuckle sandwich the shit out of this strawman. This attitude seems strangely out of touch with economic realities.\nAny sensible leftist would agree that an excellent plumber deserves a higher salary than a mediocre one. Inequality of outcome only becomes an issue when the boss of these plumbers makes hundreds of times more than his* employees. Such is the reality we now face. While the size of the US economy doubled over the past few decades, nearly all this new wealth got pocketed by the richest few percent. This had detrimental political consequences, as financial capital is easily converted into political capital. The hundreds of millions that the billionaire class invested in lobbyists, politicians and think-tanks, allowed them to steadily modify the rules of the game to their favour.\nIn a vicious spiral of cronyism \u2014 economic and political inequality perpetuated one another for decades \u2014 while inflation-adjusted salaries stagnated, job security plummeted, and the cost of housing, medical care and higher education grew exponentially. 78 percent of US workers now live paycheck to paycheck. 40 million rely on food stamps. A cove of recent research has demonstrated the massive \u00abcognitive load\u201d caused by financial insecurity. Living in relative poverty turns out to be akin to losing 13 IQ points.\nPathologizing and belittling outrage against this state of affairs, as \u00abresentment towards the wealthy\u00bb, is a sleazy cheap shot. There is nothing \u00abradical\u00bb or \u00abmurderous\u00bb about demanding a halt to this unprecedented surge of inequality. On the contrary. Accepting the life expectancy of poor Americans to remain 15 years lower than those of their wealthier peers, is a murderous inequality doctrine. Forcing poor families to choose between their mortgage or medical care for a loved one, is a murderous inequality doctrine. Condemning diabetics, who can\u2019t afford their insulin, to an early death, is a murderous inequality doctrine.\nRedistributing Americas abundant wealth, is not a slippery slope to the Gulag, as Dr. Peterson seems to imply, but rather a prerequisite for a flourishing society.\n\u00abEquality of opportunity\u00bb, on the other hand, (the idea that inequality of outcome is acceptable as long as it stems from unequal talent and effort, rather than accidents of birth), he put forth as not only acceptable, but as \u00abeminently desirable for everyone\u00bb. Despite sounding like a hollow rhetorical device for opposing redistributive policies, the ideal that everyone should be dealt identical cards, is in fact radically progressive. The playing field can only be leveled by dealing with the root cause of its unevenness: The ability of elites to pass their privilege on to the next generation.\nWe don\u2019t even have to consider the Donald Trumps and Koch brothers of the world, who got ahead by inheriting their daddies fortunes. Privilege comes in many shades of grey. Simply being born into a middle class family is a stupendous head start: Growing up in an affluent neighborhood, you will attend a well-funded school; befriend other middle class kids, some of whom may grow up to be invaluable connections; you will be largely sheltered from the gangs, drugs and violence, plaguing inner city neighborhoods; you will have access to the upscale tutoring and test-prep industry. Your parents may even finance your education, shielding you from the horrifying student depts of working class graduates. Most elite colleges still practice \u201clegacy admissions,\u201d giving preference to kids who happen to be the offspring of alumni, thus further tilting the playing field in their favor.\nEven the air you breath puts you at an advantage. You get to grow up at a safe distance from the industrial pollution sources, disproportionately located in poor neighborhoods. Air pollution not only harms the lungs of children \u2014 it also cross their permeable blood-brain barriers, interfering with their fragile, developing brains. A UNICEF meta study found exposure to air pollution during early childhood to correlate with \u00abfuture developmental delays, lower verbal IQ, and increased signs of anxiety, depression, and problems with attention\u00bb.\nIt is no coincidence that most \u00abself-made\u00bb billionaires you are likely to know of, won the lottery of birth: Warren Buffet was the son of a congressman; Bill Gates, the son of a business-tycoon; Jeff Bezos, the step-son of an Exxon engineer; Mark Zuckerberg\u2019s parents were both physicians; Those of Larry Page, both university professors. Had any of them been born into a blue collar/ peasant family, their odds of achieving what they did, would dwindle. This is not to say that merit is irrelevant. It\u2019s just not a good stand-in for being born in the right place at the right time. While the rags-to-riches mythos retains a sweet spot in our collective imagination, it\u2019s real life examples are exceedingly rare.\nInstead of dismissing Dr. Petersons call for \u00abequality of opportunities\u00bb as symptomatic of his affection with hierarchies, progressives ought to embrace it, and start elaborating what equality of opportunity actually entails.\nDr. Peterson\u2019s conceptual critique of \u00abwhite guilt\u00bb and \u00abwhite privilege\u00bb, got misconstrued as racism. His denunciation of identity politics and women\u2019s studies, as bigotry and sexism. Having fans among the alt-right made him a \u00abdarling of the alt-right\u00bb. His fondness for mythology (traditionally a cornerstone of fascist ideology) meant he was \u00abflirting with facism\u00bb. Advocating social norms in favor of monogamy turned into support for something akin to state-sponsored sex-slavery.\nThis cacophony of misbegotten cries of \u00abWolf!\u00bb, crowds out any serious criticism of Dr. Peterson, and degrades it through guilt by association.\nThe whole shebang resembles the way liberal media\u2019s attacks on Donald Trump backfired to pave his path to the white house. These controversial thought leaders share what NYU professor of risk engineering, Nassim Taleb describes as antifragility: They thrive and grow when exposed to stressors. They benefit from media scandals and critique. Instead of watering down their message in order to preempt critique, they welcome critics, and counterpunch however they see fit. As a result, they appear bold and authentic, which draws everlarger crowds into their orbits.\nIt\u2019s hard to tell who Dr. Peterson\u2019s critics thinks they are fooling. From the outside, their attempts to vilify him by twisting his words into unrecognizable bigotry seems try-hard and cringe worthy. Yet, like any behavior, it makes sense once its context is understood.\nThis context is the vicious Darwinist logic of online publishing: you either chase clicks, or get outcompeted by those who do. The likes of Dr. Peterson presents liberal media with only three options:\nI: Attack the same weak spots over and over\nII: Ignore him once his weak spots are sufficiently attacked\nIII: Continually seek out new angles to attack him from\nAs long as readers stay interested, option III is the fittest one. Liberal pundits have to keep finding new (if evermore contrived) ways to criticize him, or yield clicks (and survivability) to those who do. Needless to say, this state of affairs is highly exploitable by antifragile thought leaders like Dr. Peterson.\n*or her\n", "claps": "834 claps", "author": "Erlend Kulander Kvitrud", "comments": [], "link": "https://medium.com/@erlendkulanderkvitrud/the-million-strawman-march-on-jordan-b-peterson-d1441bde8312"}, {"title": "Bill Binney States that the NSA Has 32 Pages of Communications Between Seth Rich and Julian...", "num_comments": 7, "tags": ["seth rich", "dnc", "bill binney", "politics", "foia"], "reading_time": 7, "text": "About six months ago, a blogpost by \u201cPublius Tacitus\u201d appeared regarding attorney Ty Clevenger\u2019s FOIA request regarding Seth Rich:\nAt the time this appeared, I felt that it was of high significance, but I wasn\u2019t quite sure what it meant. What is meant by \u201cany information regarding Julian Assange and Seth Rich?\u201d Reports generated within the NSA that mention both? Communications in which either mentions the other? Direct communications between the two? What was the actual language of Clevenger\u2019s request?\nThe final sentence of the blogpost seems to muddy the waters even more:\n\u201cAnd other people\u201d?\nAlthough I was somewhat confused by the meaning of this revelation, I commented on its significance. At the very least, it meant that the view that Seth was the source of the Wikileaks DNC releases was more than the brainless and callous conspiracy theory that mainstream media were making it out to be.\nFortunately, Bill Binney, one of the founding fathers of the NSA, and universally acknowledged to be one of the most brilliant people who ever worked for the U.S. government, has offered clarification on this issue in a brief interview with Ed Butowsky he gave two days ago.\nIn this interview, he offers a devastating rebuke of the fraudulence of the Mueller report\u2019s analysis of \u201cRussian hacking\u201d. But the truly fascinating part occurs at about 6:40, where Binney discusses Clevenger\u2019s FOIA request.\nHere\u2019s what Binney says:\nIf Binney is interpreting this correctly \u2014 and bear in mind that, not only is he extraordinarily bright, but he is sometimes referred to as \u201cthe father of the NSA\u201d \u2014 this provides strong support for the hypothesis that Seth was indeed Wikileaks\u2019 source for the DNC emails it published. Assange has strongly hinted at this, Sy Hersh claims to have a trusted informant inside the FBI who states that he has seen FBI documents verifying this, and Binney himself says that he has two sources inside the intel community vouching for this.\n(Go to the 8:30 mark \u2014 Binney inadvertently refers to \u201cSeth\u201d when he means \u201cSy\u201d.)\nConsistent with the possibility that Seth (or some other DNC employee) leaked the documents, Binney and colleagues have recently demonstrated that the DNC documents passed through a thumbdrive prior to their publication. There would have been no obvious need for such a transfer if Russians had hacked them remotely.\nBeyond that, as Binney makes clear, the Mueller report\u2019s tale of how Wikileaks received the DNC emails from GRU agents styling themselves as \u201cGuccifer 2.0\u201d is absurd on its face to reasonable people who will examine the pertinent evidence.\nAstute cyberanalysts such as Adam Carter, the Forensicator, and Binney himself have presented compelling evidence that, far from being a Russian hacker masquerading as Romanian, G2.0 has operated in US time zones, down-loaded some of his \u201chacks\u201d via thumbdrive, purposely implanted \u201cRussian fingerprints\u201d in the meta-data of some of his releases, made amateur attempts to impersonate a Russian using intermittently broken English, and never himself published any documents denigratory to the Clinton campaign. The GRU, if indeed they had hacked the DNC, would have had no need for such a ridiculous figure \u2014 but G2.0 functions wonderfully as a vehicle for incriminating Russia as the source of the DNC emails published by Wikileaks, tarring Russia and Assange with the same brush. G2.0\u2019s contact with Wikileaks shortly (too shortly!) before the Wikileaks DNC release was evidently an attempt to produce a false trail that investigators (i.e. Mueller) could point to as G2.0's hand-off of the DNC emails to Wikleaks.\nAnd if you examine Mueller\u2019s report carefully, you\u2019ll note that he never actually states or demonstrates that the material which G2.0 passed along to Wikileaks consisted of the DNC emails which Wikileaks published, undoubtedly because Mueller has no evidence for this. Indeed, the Forensicator has now shown that DNC emails with attachments which Wikileaks published would require the transfer of a file far larger that the \u201c1 Gb or so\u201d transfer described in Mueller\u2019s report.\nThe cyberanalytic findings pointing to G2.0 being a fraud masquerading as a Russian hacker are touched on in Binney\u2019s video, and comprehensively discussed in the website of Adam Carter devoted to this issue:\nHow does Mueller\u2019s report deal with this countervailing evidence? Does he offer credible rebuttals to each of the findings? No, with consummate dishonesty he simply ignores this evidence in toto. And he feels no compunction to address this evidence because, with rare exception the stenographic MSM have done so as well, so that most Americans are wholly unaware of it. Mueller\u2019s report on \u201cRussian meddling\u201d is simply intended to reinforce the Deep State\u2019s preferred narrative, which he achieves by cherry-picking the evidence that he deigns to consider. This was the precise strategy that our Deep State \u2014 including Mueller himself \u2014 employed when they sold our nation on Saddam\u2019s vast stocks of WMDs.\nAnd here\u2019s another intriguing point. Crowdstrike\u2019s co-founder Shawn Henry used to be Mueller\u2019s deputy at the FBI, acting as head of the counterintelligence division. Adam Carter informs me that, while Henry headed that division, it made an attempt to destroy Wikileaks\u2019 reputation by feeding it documents that had been purposely altered; fortunately, Wikileaks exercised its customary caution and refused to take the bait. G2.0 \u2014 very likely a creation of Crowdstrike \u2014 appears to have been another attempt to smear Wikileaks, one that has worked wonderfully well with much of the American public. Clinton\u2019s incompetence was expiated, Wikileaks was smeared, and the Russia was further defamed, all in one stroke \u2014 the Deep State\u2019s wet dream! Assange became, not a journalist working with an American whistleblower disgusted by the gross bias of the DNC against Bernie, but instead a tool of malign Russians intent on meddling in our democracy and saddling us with the ridiculous Trump.\nAnd, as to Seth Rich\u2019s mysterious death, ask yourself this: who would have been in a perfect position to destroy the \u201cRussian hacking\u201d narrative that Clinton\u2019s campaign and Crowdstrike had decided to run with?\nSo let\u2019s push to get the real story out. And, if it turns out that Seth was indeed the source of the DNC emails published by Wikileaks, we\u2019ll need to apologize to Russia, and then decide whom to send to prison for the rest of their miserable prevaricating lives.\nUpdate: Reader Leonardo Facchin has found the entire letter from NSA responding to Ty Clevenger\u2019s FOIA request, which he has posted below. This indicates that Clevenger had asked for more than just communications between Seth and Assange, and that Binney might therefore be incorrect in concluding that all 32 pages consist of such communications. However, the fact that NSA has 32 pages of secret/top secret documents on Seth remains highly significant \u2014 and the other findings cited here pointing to Seth as the likely leaker, and discrediting Mueller\u2019s claim that G2.0 is a Russian hacker who was Assange\u2019s source, remain valid.\n", "claps": "1.2K claps", "author": "Mark F.

It landed on the front page of Reddit, put me on the map on Quora literally overnight, and set the stage for the five years of writing I\u2019ve done since.\nSomeone on Quora recently asked me whether I still lifted weights or not. What I ended up writing feels honest and true, so I figured I\u2019d share it here on Medium as well.\nEnjoy.\nYes, I stopped bodybuilding \u2014 and for long stretches of time, I stopped working out completely.\nThere are a few reasons why.\nI remember the day because a mentor of mine loves telling this story.\nIt was my 26th birthday, and as the day at the office was coming to a close, my boss and mentor said, \u201cHey, how about I treat you to a birthday dinner. You love steak. Pick anywhere in the city and let\u2019s go.\u201d\nBut I didn\u2019t want to go out for my birthday.\nIt was a Monday, and I wanted to hit chest.\nSo I said, \u201cNo thanks,\u201d took the train back to my apartment, changed into my workout clothes, and went to the gym.\nIt was one of the best lifts I had ever had in my entire life. And to be honest, the real reason why I decided not to go out for a birthday dinner was because I hadn\u2019t missed a day at the gym in months. I was on a roll. May, 2016, I was arguably in the best shape of my entire life. I was also stronger than I\u2019d ever been: squatting 315, benching 250, and being able to do supersets to the point where my veins looked like they were going to explode.\nAt the very end of my workout, and still feeling like I had more energy to burn, I decided to do one last exercise: chest flies mixed with pushups.\nI remember being downstairs at Quads Gym downtown Chicago. I was on my second set. And all of a sudden, right in the middle of my ten pushups, I felt something pop near my neck. It was the strangest feeling, and what confused me was that I didn\u2019t immediately feel pain. My muscles were so pumped from two hours of working out that it just felt like a weird twinge. So, not thinking anything of it, I decided to keep lifting.\nIt wasn\u2019t until I got home, thirty minutes later, that all of a sudden the pain started to kick in.\nI was making dinner, when my whole left trap felt like it was on fire. When I turned my head to look at my left arm, a shooting pain ran from the bottom of my skull all the way through my shoulder and down my spine. It hurt so badly that I just froze, in a contorted position, and tried to take a deep breath. Every second that passed though, the pain just got worse. And worse. Until my head was pounding so badly that I wondered if I had to go to the hospital.\nI spent the next month on Vicodin and Codeine. It was horrible. I would show up to the office and walk around with an ice pack resting on my neck, only taking it off for meetings with clients. I would try to get as much work done before popping another painkiller and knowing my productivity would be shot. I couldn\u2019t lift. Not lifting made me depressed. And the more depressed I got, the more I started to really question whether I\u2019d ever be able to lift that seriously again.\nIt took me six months of resting and mild stretching before I could even step foot in a gym again. And then every time I would, I\u2019d lift for two or three days, feel that part of my neck and trap flare up again, and then have to stop. This went on indefinitely \u2014 until eventually, I just stopped trying altogether.\nAt a certain point, I accepted I would never be able to bodybuild again. Physically, herniating that disc caused a lot of trauma to the muscles in my back. I\u2019m still working through knots that have formed around my left shoulder from me trying to \u201clean away\u201d from the pain. And my awkward posture for the months of my healing has led to my mild scoliosis worsening, with my entire right side now overcompensating for my weakened left.\nNeedless to say, I still have a lot of healing to do before I can approach the gym the same way I did when I was 24, 25, 26. And if and when I am able to get back to a place where it\u2019s possible to lift seriously again, I don\u2019t think I\u2019ll want to go back to putting my body under that level of physical stress.\nAs painful as herniating a disc was, it was a blessing in disguise.\nI didn\u2019t realize it at the time, but lifting was still my number one priority. I worked as a copywriter for 8\u201310 hours per day, five days per week, and then as soon as work was over, I lifted. I put lifting over dating. Lifting over going out and making new friends. I even put lifting over writing. There wasn\u2019t a single day between the ages of 23 and 26 that I chose to skip the gym to write instead.\nI wrote almost every night. But if it ever came down to it, I always chose to lift.\nThe reason why herniating a disc was a blessing in disguise was because it removed lifting from the equation entirely. After my month spent on painkillers, I\u2019d come home from work and not be able to do much else except write. I was in too much pain to be social, too much pain to even stretch or do a mild workout. And (if you\u2019ve read a lot of my work then you know this story) I still didn\u2019t have Internet in my apartment. That was a promise I\u2019d made to myself right after graduating college. I would not get Internet until I finished my first book: Confessions of a Teenage Gamer.\nWell, those few months right after I got injured, I finally finished it.\nWith nothing else to do, I invested all those hours I would have been lifting into writing instead. And not only did I finish Confessions, but I wrote some of my most popular Quora Answers and Inc Magazine columns, started ghostwriting for a handful of executives, and ultimately reached a point (4 months later) where I felt ready to \u201ctake the leap\u201d and become a full-time writer.\nLetting go of lifting helped me realize my true potential as a writer.\nI\u2019ll never forget, about eight months later when I tried to return to the gym, I met one of my old workout friends there for a lift. Already nearly twenty pounds smaller, I looked at myself in the mirror and hated what I saw. I felt like years of hard work were vanishing right before my very eyes, and there was nothing I could do about it.\nListening to me vent, my friend turned to me and said, \u201cCole, don\u2019t get me wrong, you were a beast in the gym. But your potential is bigger than just lifting weights.\u201d\nIn that moment, hearing him say that, even if I wasn\u2019t ready to admit it out loud, I knew he was right. I loved lifting. Loved it with all my heart. But I was giving too much priority to something that wasn\u2019t my highest potential. Which meant I had to start treating it more like a hobby, a form of self care \u2014 and less like a sport.\nI had to let it go.\nHerniating that disc in my neck caused a lot of major life events to happen in a very short amount of time.\nMy injury happened end of May, 2016.\nBy August, I\u2019d finished my book, was getting ready to release it to the world, and had decided I was going to take the leap and go all-in on my talents as a writer.\nSeptember, I published Confessions, quit my job, and immediately flew out to Los Angeles to work on a startup with a few friends.\nOctober, I had started dating a girl from Arizona (that I\u2019d met in LA). I was on planes 3 out of every 4 weeks of the month, month after month. I was flying from Chicago to Arizona to see my first girlfriend in almost four years. I was flying to LA to work on this startup. And I was flying to Atlanta to try to convince my (now co-founder, Drew Reggie) to quit his job and take the leap with me. My first real month as a freelance writer, out on my own, and I doubled my income.\nNovember, I was spending more time in other cities than I was in Chicago. I was ghostwriting for a handful of incredibly successful entrepreneurs and C-level executives. I was starting to realize that my potential was way bigger than just \u201cbeing a freelance writer.\u201d And, I doubled my income again, meaning two months after I\u2019d quit my job, I went from making $45k/year to over six figures. Instead of spending it on a new apartment or a car, I saved it. And the way I started to think about my future got bigger.\nBy December, I was living the dream. I had effectively doubled my salary, again, meaning I was outearning my former job by a factor of four. I was working 2\u20133 hours per day. I was taking vacations with my new serious girlfriend. I was treating us to anything that sounded like fun: fancy dinners, Broadway shows, museums, expensive hotels. Everything I\u2019d deprived myself of during my bodybuilding years, I let myself enjoy. I stopped counting my meals. I ordered wine with dinner. I ate for pleasure instead of for \u201cgains.\u201d And honestly, I loved every second of it.\nBy January, 2017, it had become very clear to me that my life was taking a very different direction \u2014 and things only started moving faster. In February, Drew quit his job and took the leap with me. Four months later, we launched Digital Press. By the end of the summer, we had over 25 clients and I had decided to move out to Los Angeles. By fall, we\u2019d crossed ten full-time employees. And by the time January 2018 rolled around, I looked like I\u2019d never lifted weights seriously in my life.\nI had become an entrepreneur, and a professional writer.\nMy friend was right: my potential was bigger than just lifting weights.\n", "claps": "541 claps", "author": "Nicolas Cole", "comments": [], "link": "https://theascent.pub/my-first-article-with-1m-views-was-my-bodybuilding-story-heres-why-i-gave-the-sport-up-dca22cfef4e1"}, {"title": "The Average Employee Works 3 Hours Out Of Every 8 \u2013 The Startup \u2013 Medium", "num_comments": "unspecified", "tags": [], "reading_time": 5, "text": "Many of us go to work each day and don\u2019t feel like working.

You remember how the story goes...\nWhile today \u201cThe Wright Brothers\u201d is the first name that comes to anyone\u2019s mind when they hear the word fly, once upon a time the pair were major underdogs.\nIn fact, during the race to the sky, most of America had its money on the man I mentioned earlier, Langley.\nHe was an extremely outspoken astronomer, physicist and aviation pioneer who was on a mission to make history. Langley\u2019s high stature as the Secretary of the Smithsonian Institution gave him both the credibility and hype he needed to get America on his side.\nNot to mention, he was extremely well-backed by the War Department who contributed $50,000 to help him be the first to get a bird in the sky.\nLong story short, despite all the hype, Langley\u2019s flying machine ended up crashing and burning while The Wright Brother\u2019s plane ended up soaring.\nOne party had the entire world, vast resources and plenty of moolah on his side, while the other just had a small bike shop and a passion to fly.\nSo, let me ask you this... can you guess why The Wright Brothers achieved their goal to take flight while Langley failed?\nThe Wright Brothers victory over Langley came down to passion, intrinsic motivation (Langley was very status driven) and perhaps praise.\nWhile Langley was sharing his ambitions with the world and being heavily praised for feats he had not yet achieved, The Wright Brothers were receiving little to no attention whatsoever.\nSome experts argue that early praise can leave the individual receiving the praise feeling like he or she has already won... in turn causing them to be less likely to follow through with their goals.\nFor example, in Peter Gollwitzer\u2019s research article, When Intentions Go Public, he raises this very question:\nGollwitzer and his team of researchers carried out a handful of studies, here is a brief excerpt from their findings:\n\u201cOther people\u2019s taking notice of one\u2019s identity-relevant intentions apparently engenders a premature sense of completeness regarding the identity goal.\u201d\nIn English, what Gollwitzer found was that when individuals set a goal that is closely tied to their identity and then share their intentions with others, they are less likely to achieve the goal.\nFor example, if your goal is to start drinking more water and you tell your friends and family that you\u2019re going to start drinking more water, this would probably have little to no impact on whether or not you actually drink more water.\nWhy? Because drinking more water isn\u2019t something you hold close to your identity.\nOn the other hand, if your goal is to lose 40 lbs and drop 2\u20133 waist sizes, it might not be the best idea to post about it all over Facebook. Your appearance is something you very much so identify with. So, if you tell people you plan to lose weight and everyone tells you how awesome you are and how great you\u2019re going to look, you might be less likely to lose the weight.\nThis finding is a bit counterintuitive, considering we were told by our teachers and coaches growing up to set our goals, share our goals, hold ourselves accountable.\nBut, the theory certainly holds some weight (pun very much intended), and is one that has been adopted by highly successful serial entrepreneurs like Derek Sivers, founder of CD Baby.\nSivers gave a TED Talk on this very topic nearly a decade back. To prove his point, he asked the audience to imagine how they felt when they shared their goals with others:\nSivers goes on to explain that it\u2019s this \u201cwarm feeling\u201d that keeps us from battling on to actually achieve our goals.\nWhen we openly share our goals, we experience a feeling of success that normally only takes place upon completion of the goal.\nThe result? We don\u2019t ever actually pursue the goal.\nI\u2019ve recently shared 3 real-life business tactics to achieve your \u201cbig hairy goals\u201d. But now, let\u2019s talk about what can actually work when it comes to successfully reaching your goals.\nFor two counterintuitive yet effective approaches to this, we look to a philosophy called \u201cfear-setting\u201d and making an effort to surround yourself with competition.\nEntrepreneur, angel investor and writer, Tim Ferriss, gave an incredible TED Talk where he discussed how fear-setting is instrumental in achieving one\u2019s goals.\nHe recommends that instead of obsessively sharing your goals, you should come to terms with all the fears that are preventing you from achieving them.\nFor example, let\u2019s say your goal is to start your own business. Ferriss recommends that you write down all of your fears that are associated with starting a business.\nThese might include... \u201cLosing all my money\u201d... \u201cGetting fired from my day job\u201d... \u201cGetting laughed at or judged if I fail\u201d.\nOnce you write down these fears, you should then write down how you would go about preventing these fears (or mitigating the likelihood) of them actually happening.\nFor example, for the first fear \u201closing all my money\u201d, your prevention might be... \u201cI\u2019m only going to invest $2,500 that way I can\u2019t lose it all.\u201d\nFinally, after you have written down your preventions, you should then write down how you will repair what you fear from happening... if it actually ends up happening.\nSo, to repair losing the $2,500, you might write down, \u201cGet a part time job as a bartender in addition to my day job until I make the $2,500 back.\u201d\nBy concentrating on fear-setting over goal-sharing, it allows you to remove the fear that is keeping you from actually achieving your goals.\nIn addition to fear-setting, it might also be a good idea to surround yourself with competition.\nA healthy dose of competition can be good for your business, too. At JotForm, we love to use competition to our advantage with events like hackweeks to achieve our product release goals.\nA study published two years ago in the journal Preventive Medicine Reports, sheds some light on the impact that competition has on our goals.\nThe study put 800 undergraduate and graduate students at the University of Pennsylvania through an 11-week exercise program where each person was assigned to work out alone or in a team.\nIn addition, the teams were designed to be either supportive or competitive.\nBy the end of the study, researchers found that students involved in the competitive team programs were 90% more likely to attend their scheduled exercise sessions than any other group.\nNot only is this number staggering, but it also proves that competition can create a higher level of commitment among people chasing down goals.\nWhen you surround yourself with competition, it doesn\u2019t mean that you have to share your goals with the competition. You don\u2019t have to tell the other folks in the spin class, cross-fit training or pick-up basketball leagues that your goal is to lose 50 lbs.\nBut, by simply showing up and placing yourself in a competitive environment, you will be more likely to push harder and show up more often \u2014 two factors that can help your reach your goals.\nThe science behind achieving goals has always been an interesting topic.\nWhile some entrepreneurs advocate the idea that you should never have a goal, I\u2019ve recently explained why setting big goals can make you miserable.\nWhether you decide to share your goals or not, what I\u2019ve found out across 12 years of entrepreneurship is that you should craft your own path.\nWhat works for others won\u2019t always work for you.

Most of you will more than likely skip the majority of the article, scrolling down in search of the payoff just to figure out if the read is worth your time. I wouldn\u2019t blame you. I\u2019d do the same. :)\nI\u2019ll at least give you a hint, since you\u2019ve made it this far . It\u2019s \u201cTrust.\u201d\nTwenty years ago, I was lucky enough to begin my career at a world-renowned design agency working on one of the biggest (at the time) computer maker\u2019s online website roughly. We were responsible for practically every aspect of our client\u2019s online experience. And if you\u2019ve ever bought a computer, you know that one of the most daunting tasks is configuring what you need based on all the options presented.\nWe were given a simple ask, but to our surprise, it wasn\u2019t simplifying the configuration process. We entered that conference room and were told \u201cwe need to increase the revenue of each order by $1 \u20133 for every computer being bought.\u201d Everyone in the room had the same immediate reaction, \u201cJust increase the prices by a $1.\u201d However, they quickly added the caveat that prices had to remain the same \u2014 no price increases.\nSince raising prices was off the table, we looked at every solution that could generate more opportunities for customers to buy additional items and/or to look past buying the cheapest thing possible when buying a computer. When ideating, our goal was to avoid making our client seem pushy or that they were just trying to get people to buy the more expensive option(s). We wanted to instill trust and usefulness in the buying experience so customers didn\u2019t get turned off when trying to purchase.\nWe knew most customers tended to configure their computers by the price of the options, rather than how they intended to use it which means they usually cheaped out on everything they could. This got us thinking about how we needed to educate customers on how to choose what was best for how they intended to use it, since that would easily increase sales and would be beneficial for the customer rather than getting something that wasn\u2019t up to the task they were buying it for.\nThe difficult part in all this was to create a simple solution that could provide customers the proper guidance without becoming a lesson in computer science.\nWhen thinking through problems in general, I always think about relatable analogies to tease out any possible solutions as it usually helps me ideate. Then it dawned on me \u2014 a past experience from when I worked at a hotel and everyone would ask what restaurants I most recommended in the area. They knew there were a bunch of options, but didn\u2019t know what was best. As a result, they sought out others to help with a choice \u2014 remember, this was 20 years ago, before smartphones. ;)\nThis of course wasn\u2019t a new concept. However, it wasn\u2019t a pattern being used in this context previously and it added that level of trust and education for customers looking to understand what options others were selecting when deciding on their Processor, RAM, or a Hard-drive.\nPreviously, user testing would routinely indicate that customers never trusted suggestions from our client, as they always felt they were just trying to get them to pay more for things they didn\u2019t need. Because of this, my first approach was to provide guidance based on what others purchased. However I still came up with two solutions to test with to see what customers responded better to:\n1. Popular choice2. We recommend\nThe testing results were pretty unexpected. We found that while users didn\u2019t necessarily trust our client, they would more readily trust the \u201cWe recommend\u201d over the \u201cPopular choice\u201d \u2014 since they felt our client would know better than just random customers.\nUltimately, the test results were extremely positive and customers didn\u2019t feel as clueless when this simple two word phrase was added to key configuration options. Based on the initial testing, this little enhancement added such a positive element to the experience that we were pretty anxious to hear about the impact it had.\nWe waited about 6 months before we were able to get the initial results from our client. When we finally had the chance to ask, they mentioned that we didn\u2019t meet their target of increasing transactions by $1 \u20133 per sale, we exceeded it! Each sale had increased by $5, which sounds like very little when you talk about an average transaction in the thousands. However, if you compound that with how many computer sales they were producing per week at the time, we calculated an increase of over 500K per month in revenue (conservatively) or about six million dollars in a year. This was 20 years ago and this same pattern is still being used today. I can only imagine how much it\u2019s helped produce over that span of time!\n", "claps": "838 claps", "author": "Alex Swain", "comments": [], "link": "https://medium.com/design-ibm/two-words-that-have-made-millions-d8fcc402e658"}, {"title": "Travel Is No Cure for the Mind \u2013 Personal Growth \u2013 Medium", "num_comments": 833, "tags": ["philosophy", "life lessons", "mindfulness", "travel", "self improvement"], "reading_time": 16, "text": "At this very moment, you may be here:\nOr you may be here:\nOr here:\nBut most likely, you\u2019re probably here:\nIt\u2019s just another day... and you\u2019re just doing what you need to do.\nYou\u2019re getting things done, and the day moves forward in this continuous sequence of checklists, actions, and respites.\nBut at various moments of your routine, you pause and take a good look at your surroundings.\nThe scenes of your everyday life. The blur of this all-too-familiar film.\nAnd you can\u2019t help but to wonder...\nIf there is more to it all.\nFor some reason \u2014 this country, this city, this neighborhood, this particular street \u2014 is the place you are living a majority of your life in.\nAnd it is this thought that allows a daydream to seep in.\nYou start thinking of all the other places you could be in this world.\nOr more accurately, all the places you\u2019d rather be in.\nSomewhere more exciting. Somewhere new. Somewhere that can provide experiences that are foreign to you.\nYou dream of going to the beautiful beaches of Thailand:\nOr to Paris, where you can eat French food, enjoy delicious wine, and walk around the illuminated streets that you\u2019ve heard so much about:\nOr to Peru, where you can finally go to Machu Picchu and see the architectural wonder that an inexplicably high percentage of your friends have in their Facebook profile pictures:\nOr to Alaska, where you can witness the glory of the aurora borealis in all its splendor:\nThe world is your playground, and you are certain that these unexplored areas will become sources of adventure, wonderment, and ultimately, happiness.\nTravel is the answer much of us look to when we feel the automation of life. The routine of waking up, getting ready, going to work, eating the same lunch, sitting in meetings, getting off work, going home, eating dinner, relaxing, going to sleep, and then doing it all over again can feel like a never-ending road that is housed within the confines of a mundane box.\nThis is The Box of Daily Experience, and it is the space we occupy on any given day of the week/month/year in which we live our lives. It is what we consider \u201cnormal\u201d in the context of an everyday experience, and is the operating system we run ourselves on when we require a sequence of events to default to.\nThe boundaries of our box define our present-day situation, so when we dreamingly gaze toward the prospects of an exciting future, we look outside of it to experience emotions like wonderment, amazement, and inspiration. Our current box is okay and livable, but the world outside of its boundaries is where our hope really resides.\nSince much of what we desire lives on the outside (i.e. in the future), we make it the mission of our Box of Daily Experience to make contact with the outer world as much as possible. This touch represents the achievement of our goals and validates our aspirations. We hope that this brief contact will change the architecture of our box, but ultimately, the result is fleeting.\nFor example, let\u2019s say that a friend introduces you to the existence of an awesome new car. You are immediately intrigued by it, and as you read review after review of its astonishing performance, the car quickly becomes an object of intense excitement and desire for you.\nThe outer world has given you a tangible goal to work towards, and your box will do whatever it can to give you the resources you need to reach it.\nSo you churn and churn through the cycle of the daily experience.\nDays turn into weeks, weeks into months, months into years.\nAnd one day, your hard work pays off. You receive that fat promotion you\u2019ve been working towards, and now you can finally afford that beautiful car!\nExcitement froths at the brim of your mind as you purchase it and drive it off the lot. This is what you\u2019ve been working so hard for! Now that you have this car, the structure of your box has fundamentally changed, and your box as you know it will no longer be the same!\nYou start driving it to and from work, to and from your hang out sessions with friends, to and from everywhere.\nBut here\u2019s the thing.\nWhile you\u2019re still happy to have the new car, you notice that your excitement about owning it just isn\u2019t as high as that day you drove it off the lot.\nThen some months pass, with fewer and fewer people commenting on the novelty of your car.\nAnd even more time passes. You get into your car, drive it to and from work, get stuck in traffic, park it in the same old spot, etc.\nYour car is starting to look a little dirty, but you don\u2019t care about washing it too much anymore because your car is just... a car now.\nIt\u2019s been years since you\u2019ve purchased it, and now it\u2019s simply a vehicle that takes you from Point A to Point B with unremarkable regularity.\nAnd then one day, your box is simply The Box of Daily Experience again, with the same mundane texture and familiar color it possessed in the past.\nThe interesting thing is that you can replace the object of desire (car) with any other noun (a new house, a new job, a new relationship, etc.), and the same pattern will emerge. Shifting and swapping the contents of your box may briefly alter the shape of it in the form of excitement, but in the end, these things will become just another part of normal life.\nSo if moving around the contents of the box doesn\u2019t work, you look to the supposed root of the problem:\nThe box itself.\nYou decide that the box known as your environment needs to be left behind because it is the source of perpetual discontentment to begin with. You need to rip open the box and jettison yourself into an unfamiliar territory that holds the key to true novelty and sustained wonderment.\nAnd you determine that the best way to do this is through the avenue of travel.\nSo you save up some money, take some time off work, pack up your bags, and head off to a country you\u2019ve never been to. You can now revel in the beauty of the unfamiliar and immerse yourself in a boundless expanse of culture, cuisine, and life that your box has never known.\nThe drawback to this is that for most of us, traveling happens in the form of vacations. A vacation is designed to be an exciting respite we take to keep us incentivized to return back to The Box of Daily Experience upon its conclusion. In a way, it\u2019s absurdly paradoxical \u2014 churning the gears of the box is what provides us with the fiscal resources to break out of it, but the wonderful memories of our vacations are what brings us squarely back to the box once again.\nAs a result, if you\u2019re traveling as a form of vacation, you know you will be back in your box very, very shortly. This tends to provoke the behavior of \u201cexperience maximization,\u201d in which you\u2019re running around in a flurry of fatiguing excitement to experience every moment possible in your travels.\nAnd inevitably, you\u2019re back in the box, counting down the days in which you can do it again.\nIt\u2019s times like these when you begin to dream of getting out of The Box of Daily Experience for good. You realize that a vacation only serves as a dopamine hit of cultural experience, as the built-in time constraints don\u2019t allow you to truly understand the tapestry of a foreign place.\nAnd one day, you firmly decide that the answer does not reside in the box you live in now.\nIt\u2019s elsewhere, in a faraway place that you once visited and enjoyed.\nBut this time, you\u2019ll be gone for a really, really long time.\nSurely, what you\u2019re looking for must be there. Not here.\nOnce you arrive in your new environment, the excitement is palpable. Not only have you have immersed yourself in a completely new part of the world, but you also have the time to explore every crevice of it.\nYou are introduced to some new friends that live in this foreign land, and you guys make your way downtown to check out all that awesome food you\u2019ve heard about.\nNext thing you know, you have a new crew of people to hang out with! They are fun, entertaining, and exciting, which were some elements that were missing from the people back home. These new folks have a deep understanding of a culture you\u2019re eager to learn more about, so every hang out session with them is an opportunity to do things you\u2019ve never done before.\nYou can also see things you\u2019ve never seen before too, and it\u2019s fantastic.\nWow.\nIf someone asks you how life is going, you can emphatically say that it\u2019s simply amazing.\nBut remember, since you are going to be staying here for a while, having fun with interesting people and seeing new sights are not reliable roadmaps for financial sustainability. And plus, all of your friends are busy in the daytime with work, and being a lone wanderer in the early afternoon is only fun for so long.\nSo yup, it\u2019s time to get yourself a job.\nThe nature of the work is pretty similar to what you were doing in the past \u2014 it\u2019s not ideal, but it supports your dream of traveling and breaking out of the old box, so it\u2019s good enough.\nAll right. Everything is set. You now have a resource-producing engine that can power your stay in your new home, and you can continue having great experiences in this land as time progresses.\nBut here\u2019s the thing about time. No matter where you are, it moves in one direction.\nForward.\nAnd this linear movement of time is nature\u2019s way of testing what we have labeled as meaningful. Only time can reveal whether a certain pursuit is driven by fleeting novelty, or if it is motivated by a strong sense of enduring purpose.\nAnd when it comes to travel, the test of time reveals a pursuit driven by novelty very, very quickly.\nAs the days in this foreign country turn into weeks, the experiences begin to occur with a familiar sense of regularity.\nThe food that you excitedly ate when you first arrived has now become your weekday dinner spot:\nThe friends that showed you all those cool cultural things when you first arrived are now people you see every week. On top of that, you often hang out at the same places all the time as well:\nThe sights you initially paid to go see simply become buildings you pass by on the way to work:\nThe job you have here feels just like your job back home again. And speaking of home, you begin to wonder how your friends are doing, as these are the folks that have been with you through years of shared experiences, and not through weeks of short-lived moments.\nAnd without consciously realizing it yet, your life events are sequencing themselves into a familiar order... One that you tried so desperately to escape not too long ago.\nAnd as the weeks turn into months, the stark reality of it all hits you. The boundaries of an all-too-familiar shape have taken hold.\nUh-oh.\nThe Box of Daily Experience has contained you once again.\nOh no! What the hell is this box doing here again?! How has it followed you all the way over here?!\nPerhaps it\u2019s time to find another place to go to?! Somewhere even further away?! A whole other continent maybe? Since The Box of Daily Experience has returned, the subsequent urge to break out of it has come back as well.\nBut here\u2019s the thing. Regardless of what you do to break out of the box, it won\u2019t work. You can change your external environment all you want, but you will continue to travel with the one box that will always accompany you.\nThe box known as your mind.\nWhen we are obsessed with travel, we are intently focused on changing and revising our external venue while neglecting the one constant we all travel with: our minds.\nIf your mind is not at ease, then the same angst and restlessness you feel today will inevitably make itself known as you travel. That point can be delayed through novel experiences, but regardless of where you are, an uneasy mind will always unveil itself in the end.\nThat feeling of restlessness underlying all the unresolved issues you have at home will follow you wherever you go. A strained relationship with your family, a sense of purposelessness in work, a low self-worth, a strong tension with your partner, a lurking depression \u2014 the answer to any of these things does not lie in a one-way ticket to a faraway place.\nSocrates said it best:\nWe tend to grossly overestimate the pleasure brought forth by new experiences and underestimate the power of finding meaning in current ones. While travel is a fantastic way to gain insight into unfamiliar cultures and illuminating ways of life, it is not a cure for discontentment of the mind.\nWho we are inside a venue matters far more than the venue itself. Instead of having the wanderlust of travel guide our search for meaning, we have to look within and embrace the only thing that is present now. The only thing that actually exists today.\nThe Box of Daily Experience.\nInstead of viewing this box as a problem to escape, we have to realize that it is indeed the only thing that we can truly hold onto.\nWhen you view life as a continuous cycle in this box, it can be easy to take its components for granted and view everything as a mundane blur of familiar events. However, when you take the time to actually inspect the box with mindful awareness of its contents, you will discover the true amazement that lives within them. And the best tool one can use to magnify these great discoveries is the practice of gratitude.\nGratitude is what allows you to feel that same sense of wonderment about your day-to-day life as you would if you were walking the streets of a faraway city.\nGratitude is what illuminates the fact that you are a collection of (billions of) atoms that have come together to create this amazing combination of cells, neurons, and organs that allow you to touch things, taste delicious food, go hiking, laugh at funny jokes, and view the stars in a nighttime sky.\nGratitude is what allows you to realize that everyone you know and love also happens to be this collection of atoms that have assembled themselves at this precise point in time, when they could have been born thousands of years earlier or hundreds of years later. The alignment of our personal ancestries, the fact that all our forebears were healthy (and attractive) enough to reproduce, and the crazy timing of us being birthed into this world at roughly the same time is an astounding coincidence that we can\u2019t help but to be utterly amazed about and grateful for.\nBeing grateful about our existence and its relation to others allows for a blossoming of meaning and purpose in our exploration of this life. It is the starting point for an endless list of awesome things we have going for us, and we don\u2019t need to change our physical location one bit to witness this list grow.\nIf gratitude is the tool we use to highlight the innate beauty existing within our boxes, then practices such as mindfulness meditation allows these realizations to actually become a part of our daily outlook. One of the difficult things about the routines embedded in our daily experience is that they tend to congeal into one giant, uniform blob that we label as \u201clife.\u201d And this blob can harden over time to create an impenetrable barrier that prevents us from absorbing helpful advice and realizations that come to light.\nWhat meditation helps to do is soften the texture of this blob by removing our hardened egos and neurotic thoughts from the inner core of our consciousness. What we are left with is clarity and openness to see The Box of Daily Experience for what it really is: a reflection of life that can be eased into fluidity with the proper attention and care.\nWhile clarity of experience is a direct path to the calming of the mind, there is another beautiful quality to our consciousness that is often overlooked.\nThe ability to find fascination in the minds of others.\nOne source of constant wonderment and adventure comes in the form of books. Instead of searching for inspiring experiences in faraway places, these awesome things are abundantly available to us at all times.\nI particularly enjoy reading works of non-fiction, but any form of good literature is utterly captivating. Keep in mind that whenever you pick up a good book to read, you are taking an extensive journey into the mind of the author. It\u2019s amazing to me that as an ordinary person, I have immediate access to the greatest minds of the past and present, and can absorb years and years of their toiling research in just a matter of days or weeks.\nI can place myself in the mind of a renowned philosopher pondering the mystery of consciousness, or I can take a seat in the mind of a historian detailing the Mongol conquest under Genghis Khan. I can learn about anything I so desire, and that is an adventure that can always be brought to where I am now.\nThis ability to be captivated by the minds of others is also widely available in the form of our loved ones and friends. However, it\u2019s the people closest to us that we often take for granted. We tend to think we know everything there is to know about them, and our inquisitive nature is often reserved for strangers and small talk.\nBut when we genuinely become curious about our relationships, we discover that we have only touched the surface with many of the people we hold dear to us. I find this to be a recurring pattern with many of my own friends. Simply asking a question at the right moment has often led to interesting stories and perspectives that were previously veiled from my view.\nThis sharing of stories is one of the great joys I\u2019ve experienced over and over again with people. There is always an interesting story behind every mind \u2014 and hearing it widens the health of our own.\nWhile travel does expand and stretch the horizons of what we know about the world, it is not the answer we\u2019re looking for in times of unrest. To strengthen the health of the mind, the venue to do that in is the one we are in now.\nIt is location-independent, and always will be.\nThe key is not to discard The Box of Daily Experience and find a new one \u2014 it\u2019s to warmly embrace the one that we have now \u2014 with its joys, its flaws, and everything in between.\nNote: This post is my adaptation of Seneca\u2019s awesome letter to Lucilius on the subject of travel. I highly recommend that you check it out \u2014 along with all of Seneca\u2019s other wonderful letters as well.\nIf you enjoyed this post, consider joining the More To That email list.

Every situation you walk into is a sandbox, waiting for you to shape it in your imagination.\nAs early as kindergarten or elementary school, that sandbox is turned into a cage. Adults pluck metal bars into the ground from above, like Zeus throwing thunderbolts from Mount Olympus. The bars are rules and every single one takes away a little of that blankness.\nAt first, we laugh. We don\u2019t understand. We bend the bars into a jungle gym and climb on it. But with every slap on our wrist, we dare a little less. Until we\u2019re fully conditioned. Sworn in to society\u2019s code of conduct.\nFuck that. I want my blankness back. I want to look at life with fresh eyes and an open, un-opinionated mind. Not do things because \u201cwe\u2019ve always done them this way.\u201d Half the time, society\u2019s unwritten rules don\u2019t even make sense.\nJust think about the following six things. Try not to scratch your head.\nThere are two kinds of walking: strolling and getting from A to B. Why do people always rush in the first scenario, but are struck with sloth-like, slow-motion inertia in the second? That doesn\u2019t make any sense!\nDon\u2019t drag your feet when it prolongs your misery and then run through a happy, memorable experience. Don\u2019t stop dead and block other people\u2019s path in the city and then push and shove your grandma through park. When the whole point of the exercise is to be slow, be slow. And when you\u2019re en route to work, an appointment, or precious time with a friend, be fast.\nNot shopping as in \u201cI need to buy new clothes.\u201d Shopping as in \u201clet\u2019s be perfect victims of consumerism for a few hours,\u201d where you aimlessly wander the streets without any initial intention to purchase anything, yet end up spending $300 that would\u2019ve bought you a full month of rent.\nI think what people are trying to do is \u201clooking.\u201d I get it. They want the experience. The bustle of people going places, of searching and finding, of humans engaging in trade. But you can have all of that for free. Just watch. Again, be slow. Sit in a cafe\u0301, order a latte, observe. There\u2019s no need to get lost in it, to be jealous of the rich lady buying a purse, to pulverize half your bank account in a futile attempt to look more important than you are.\nUnlike walking, there\u2019s only one reason to go clubbing: to dance. Yet, and this is more of a guy problem, we prefer to overpay for drinks as we lean against the icky bar with one elbow on the counter, right in a spilled shot of tequila. But you can\u2019t talk in a club! It\u2019s too damn loud. If you\u2019re not gonna dance, you might as well stay at home.\nIf you ask me, that\u2019s often the far better choice anyway. You can play music at home. Any song you want. You can dance there too. And there aren\u2019t any sweaty people. No cover charge. You don\u2019t even have to drink. And you can do it on your schedule. No reason to waste half the night and all of the next day.\nI can\u2019t speak for all countries, but in the Western ones I\u2019ve been to, there\u2019s a fascinating dynamic that plays out every time a large group of people enters an empty bus, train, or other means of mass transportation. Within seconds, the collective maximizes the physical distance between each other. Everyone takes one seat of a two-seat row, usually the one next to the window.\nNow, whoever enters at the next stop will scan all aisles for an empty spare. They\u2019ll walk all the way to the back, only to realize they have to sit next to another person. My god. What a burden to the sovereign individual. The same happens at talks, the cinema, formal events, group seminars, and sometimes even dinner with friends.\nWe\u2019ll spend thousands of dollars on visually fitting in (remember shopping?), yet raise all hell not to when it actually matters. If only we could remember we\u2019re all human. Maybe, we\u2019d just take a seat and start talking to each other.\nThis might be my favorite, because most of the time, it makes no sense at all.\nWe\u2019re waiting for the elevator when no one\u2019s using the stairs. We curse the slow guy with the loaded shopping cart when the store has self-checkout. We hope we\u2019ll get a table even though the restaurant offers online reservations.\nWe jump to our feet when they call our flight, but the plane still takes off if we\u2019re the last to board. We get up as soon as the plane lands, only to twist our neck standing another ten minutes in the aisle. We\u2019re dying to get off the moving train, but then fall over as it stops.\nWe queue for 20 minutes at \u201cthe most popular Shake Shack\u201d when there\u2019s an empty one just down the block. We camp in front of the Apple Store to pay the same $1,000 for a phone we could pay a week later and get it instantly. We rush into the movie theater, but our tickets have numbered seats.\nWorst of all, we choose to waste all this time standing in line, only to then try and cut, skip, pay, or cheat our way to the front if given the chance.\nMost people travel the same way they wait in line: they frantically shift from one foot to the other, hoping to soon check another item off an impossible-to-complete list. Everything\u2019s a race. The packing. Going to the airport. The check-in, boarding, and cab to the AirBnB.\nWhere\u2019s our checklist? What\u2019s the weather report? How can we fit the museum between breakfast and the sightseeing tour? This isn\u2019t travel. It\u2019s work. Travel is breathing. Living. Seeing. That requires at least trying to blend in. Soak up the culture. Listen. Take a wrong turn. You might even meet someone on the bus.\nCall me crazy, but I think children would have a hard time understanding why we do these things the way we do them. Maybe, there\u2019s some big mystery I\u2019m missing. But maybe, people just don\u2019t ask every child\u2019s favorite question:\nIt\u2019s also the one that melts our cages away. That cleans out the sandbox. If we ask it often enough, maybe our canvas will be blank again.\nNow excuse me, I gotta go hit the monkey bars.\n", "claps": "771 claps", "author": "Niklas Go\u0308ke", "comments": ["This is when it gets scary\u00a0\u2026 as we trade off our inner child freedom for an attempt to fit in and be liked.

You can stroll around the old town, browse the handicrafts in the markets, snack on local sweets, drink a beer on the beach, eat delicious Turkish food, and watch the sunset behind the ancient castle.\nIdyllic.\nYet here I am sitting in a cafe in front of a laptop, with 17 tabs open, and an endless to-do list. Hey, there are definitely worse places to work \u2014 but there are also far worse places to take an actual holiday. So why can\u2019t I close my laptop?\nI consider myself a digital nomad although I spend most of my time in my pyjamas at home in Melbourne, Australia. While I may not be hanging poolside in Bali, I do get to travel without my boss really knowing. He definitely would not call me a digital nomad. Probably something more like \u2018most demanding employee.\u2019\nI somehow manoeuvred a casual slide into nomadism by first moving interstate and then sometimes just not being within phone range while I\u2019m still working for him (ie I\u2019m in France). Someday I plan to casually manoeuvre an indefinite move overseas without him noticing.\nThat is a whole lot of upside to a copywriting job that provides a stable income. But the downside of this digital nomadic lifestyle is that I find it incredibly hard to take a break. Theoretically I know I could.

Surely there must be a misunderstanding. After all, I\u2019ve been a loyal AirBnB evangelist from the early days. I referred dozens of friends when it first launched. I even convinced my parents to list their vacation properties.\nAfter reaching out to support, I received the following unsettling email.\nOkay, this is a tough spot. Somehow I\u2019ve violated the terms of service, but they won\u2019t tell me which ones. And I can\u2019t communicate with them anymore.\nSeems a little harsh.\nAt this point, I was pretty shocked but also very curious about what I could have possibly done. After carefully reading the AirBnB terms of service and reading about the most common ways people get banned from AirBnB, I went through each of my bookings. My first thought was that I must have inadvertently paid one of the hosts in cash because this is the #1 reason why people get banned. But I confirmed that all my bookings were paid through AirBnB. No foul play there.\nAfter discussing with my girlfriend, the only thing we could think of was that we had recently had a very uncomfortable AirBnB experience with a rude host.\nAfter booking the weekend, we were told that we\u2019d need to vacate the premises from 12\u20134pm because the room was located in a spa retreat.\nThe conflict arose when the host entered the room an hour early, unannounced. She forgot to let us know she\u2019d be coming an hour early with spa guests. We weren\u2019t dressed but she continued setting up while we eventually scurried outside in front of the spa guests.\nWhen the trip was over, we decided not to leave a review after giving her the benefit of the doubt that it was just a bad day. The property itself was great.\nA few weeks later, I saw that the host left me a critical review with completely distorted details from what had actually happened\nI emailed AirBnB to report that the host had fabricated details in her review \u2014 details which could be proven within the AirBnB platform. But I was told it\u2019s against their policy to censor reviews, even if they\u2019re dishonest.\nBecause the review period had passed on AirBnB and I felt the need to do some justice to my side of the story, I left a review on Google instead. The host has received a number of similar complaints so it definitely wasn\u2019t an isolated incident.\nI still can\u2019t believe that leaving an offsite review was a bannable offense, but even more disturbing to me is the way AirBnB handled the situation with a one-sided, permanent, irreversible, closed book suspension.\nThe part that\u2019s especially poetic to me is that AirBnB touts a firm brand message of community and connectedness with their \u201cBelong Anywhere\u201d campaigns but the frightening reality is that any individual user is completely disposable, without a shred of appeal to due process. I\u2019m really thankful that I wasn\u2019t reliant on AirBnB income like so many of my friends.\nBut let\u2019s call it like it is. This policy leverages the company\u2019s power over the individual user to a cruel and unprecedented extent. And it\u2019s in laughable contradiction to the brand\u2019s inflated idealism.\nAfter emailing AirBnB support and its founders multiple times, I\u2019ve finally given up.\nMoving forward, I question whether these types of suspensions should be allowed from the tech giants without any oversight or regulation. At what point does a company become pervasive enough in everyday life that they owe users an explanation or warning before dropping the guillotine? Or is this all part of an ongoing trend, toward something like the Chinese Social Credit Score system, where the consequences of not maintaining a high rating are socially crippling?\nWe\u2019re becoming increasingly dependent on a handful of major tech giants to get through our basic daily routine. Imagine waking up one day and no longer being able to check your Gmail, buy things on Amazon, or book an Uber.\nIt all feels very 1984. Or Black Mirror.

Or maybe you\u2019re hacking on a side-project and you want it to look better than yet-another-Bootstrap-site.\nIt\u2019s easy to throw your hands up and say, \u201cI\u2019ll never be able to make this look good, I\u2019m not an artist!\u201d but it turns out there are a ton of tricks you can use to level up your work that don\u2019t require a background in graphic design.\nHere are seven simple ideas you can use to improve your designs today.\nA common mistake when styling UI text is relying too much on font size to control your hierarchy.\n\u201cIs this text important? Let\u2019s make it bigger.\u201d\n\u201cIs this text secondary? Let\u2019s make it smaller.\u201d\nInstead of leaving all of the heavy lifting to font size alone, try using color or font weight to do the same job.\n\u201cIs this text important? Let\u2019s make it bolder.\u201d\n\u201cIs this text secondary? Let\u2019s use a lighter color.\u201d\nTry and stick to two or three colors:\nSimilarly, two font weights is usually enough for UI work:\nStay away from font weights under 400 for UI work; they can work for large headings but are too hard to read at smaller sizes. If you\u2019re considering using a lighter weight to de-emphasize some text, use a lighter color or smaller font size instead.\nMaking text a lighter grey is a great way to de-emphasize it on white backgrounds, but it doesn\u2019t look so great on colored backgrounds.\nThat\u2019s because the effect we\u2019re actually seeing with grey on white is reduced contrast.\nMaking the text closer to the background color is what actually helps create hierarchy, not making it light grey.\nThere are two ways you can reduce contrast when working with colorful backgrounds:\nUse white text and lower the opacity. This lets the background color bleed through a bit, de-emphasizing the text in a way that doesn\u2019t clash with the background.\nThis works better than reducing the opacity when your background is an image or pattern, or when reducing the opacity makes the text feel too dull or washed out.\nChoose a color that\u2019s the same hue as the background, adjusting saturation and lightness until it looks right to you.\nInstead of using large blur and spread values to make box shadows more noticeable, add a vertical offset.\nIt looks a lot more natural because it simulates a light source shining down from above like we\u2019re used to seeing in the real world.\nThis applies to inset shadows like you might use on wells or form inputs too:\nIf you\u2019re interested in learning more about shadow design, the Material Design Guidelines are a fantastic primer.\nWhen you need to create separation between two elements, try to resist immediately reaching for a border.\nWhile borders are a great way to distinguish two elements from one another, they aren\u2019t the only way, and using too many of them can make your design feel busy and cluttered.\nThe next time you find yourself reaching for a border, try one of these ideas instead:\nBox shadows do a great job of outlining an element like a border would, but can be more subtle and accomplish the same goal without being as distracting.\nGiving adjacent elements slightly different background colors is usually all you need to create distinction between them. If you\u2019re already using different background colors in addition to a border, try removing the border; you might not need it.\nWhat better way to create separation between elements than to simply increase the separation? Spacing things further apart is a great way to create distinction between groups of elements without introducing any new UI at all.\nIf you\u2019re designing something that could use some large icons (like maybe the \u201cfeatures\u201d section of a landing page), you might instinctively grab a free icon set like Font Awesome or Zondicons and bump up the size until they fit your needs.\nThey\u2019re vector images after all, so the quality isn\u2019t going to suffer if you increase the size right?\nWhile it\u2019s true that vector images won\u2019t degrade in quality when you increase their size, icons that were drawn at 16\u201324px are never going to look very professional when you blow them up to 3x or 4x their intended size. They lack detail, and always feel disproportionately \u201cchunky\u201d.\nIf small icons are all you\u2019ve got, try enclosing them inside another shape and giving the shape a background color:\nThis lets you keep the actual icon closer to its intended size, while still filling the larger space.\nIf you have the budget, you could also use a premium icon set designed to be used at larger sizes, like Heroicons or Iconic.\nIf you\u2019re not a graphic designer, how do you add that dash of visual flair to your UI that other designs get from beautiful photography or colorful illustrations?\nOne simple trick that can make a big difference is to add colorful accent borders to parts of your interface that would otherwise feel a bit bland.\nFor example, along the side of an alert message:\n...or to highlight active navigation items:\n...or even across the top of your entire layout:\nIt doesn\u2019t take any graphic design talent to add a colored rectangle to your UI, and it can go a long way towards making your site feel more \u201cdesigned.\u201d\nHave a hard time picking colors? Try choosing from a constrained palette like Dribbble\u2019s color search to avoid feeling overwhelmed by the endless possibilities of a traditional color picker.\nWhen there are multiple actions a user can take on a page, it\u2019s easy to fall into the trap of designing those actions based purely on semantics.\nFrameworks like Bootstrap sort of encourage this by giving you a menu of semantic styles to choose from whenever you\u2019re adding a new button:\n\u201cIs this a positive action? Make the button green.\u201d\n\u201cDoes this delete data? Make the button red.\u201d\nSemantics are an important part of button design, but there\u2019s a more important dimension that\u2019s commonly forgotten: hierarchy.\nEvery action on a page sits somewhere in a pyramid of importance. Most pages only have one true primary action, a couple of less important secondary actions, and a few seldom used tertiary actions.\nWhen designing these actions, it\u2019s important to communicate their place in the hierarchy.\n\u201cWhat about destructive actions, shouldn\u2019t they always be red?\u201d\nNot necessarily! If the destructive action isn\u2019t the primary action on the page, it might be better to give it a secondary or tertiary button treatment.\nSave the big, red, and bold styling for when that negative action actually is the primary action in the interface, like in a confirmation dialog:\nRefactoring UI takes everything we know about design and bundles it into one comprehensive package, including a book, screencasts, a component gallery, custom designed assets, and more.\nOver 6000 people have picked it up so far, and the feedback has been amazing.\nIf you\u2019re interested, head over to RefactoringUI.com/book to learn more and download a sample.\n", "claps": "209K claps", "author": "Adam Wathan & Steve Schoger", "comments": ["<img class=\"progressiveMedia-noscript js-progressiveMedia-inner\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/407/1*hUTJcFV6P4_6Ho7pWBHeVQ.png\">here is an example where Delete button is tertiary, but when pressed it became primary"], "link": "https://medium.com/refactoring-ui/7-practical-tips-for-cheating-at-design-40c736799886"}, {"title": "Design Better Forms \u2013 UX Collective", "num_comments": 479, "tags": ["interaction design", "product design", "ux", "usability", "design"], "reading_time": 3, "text": "Whether it is a signup flow, a multi-view stepper, or a monotonous data entry interface, forms are one of the most important components of digital product design.

On one side, UX designers test out new ideas and establish new patterns. On the other, consumers react with their preferences for more efficient and pleasant ways to interact with digital products.\nIn the crazy profusion of alternatives, some designs are accepted and some are discarded. In the midst of this chaos, the balanced use of aesthetics, efficiency, and usability plays a major role in distinguishing the UX trends that have proved to be the strongest and garnered the most user acceptance.\nDesigners can come up with the coolest color scheme, the fanciest animation, or the boldest motion transition, but if the human interaction suffers as a result, the UX will be poor and people will quickly move on.\nLooking back at the last year, we highlight some of the most notable web and mobile UX design trends in play today.\nNo more loading pages or hard cut transitions is the promise of seamless sites. All content is placed on one page and is displayed seamlessly without any conventional page-to-page loading routine as a visitor interacts with the site. Data is pulled in the background, and the site is designed in such a way as to provide a fluid and seamless user experience. The \u201cLove for Iceland\u201d site is a great example. The technique doesn\u2019t work for all types of sites, but it provides great UX for smaller, simpler ones.\nPurposeful animation and motion design is an emerging UX design trend that works hand-in-hand with seamless one-page sites. Well-designed animation helps to focus people\u2019s attention on specific elements and can create a certain brand aesthetic. Motion and animation can also help with visual hierarchy in UI design \u2014 the order in which people take in and process information.\nMobile apps have had this capability for a while, and with increased processing power, smooth animations have become the norm. As with seamless sites, the latest web-browser capabilities present UX designers with a new design opportunity on the desktop.\nHowever, designers are cautioned against copying a hot trend badly, i.e., just for the sake of following a current fad. Animation and motion need to serve a purpose within the context of use to enhance a design. While the system is processing or a page is loading, they may do so, but there\u2019s nothing worse for UX than to create frustration for people by making them wait for a pointless animation to play out.\nMore and more custom brand illustrations vs. stale, routine stock imagery are appearing everywhere in digital products. Using illustrations in digital design offers more versatility because they scale more easily to different ratios and screen sizes. What\u2019s more, illustrations can represent a certain brand aesthetic and can be more playful, \u201csofter,\u201d and personal. It\u2019s about appearing less digital in the digital realm.\nThis UX design trend is also gravitating toward illustrations that are inclusive, i.e., race-neutral, and representative of people of all ages.\nAlong with the UX design trend for more playful and personal illustrations (above) is a shift toward lively animated empty pages, 404 error pages, and confirmation pages.\nIn the next decade or so, computing will become even more prevalent and will grow beyond single devices and screens. Voice interaction is just the beginning. The need to type or touch a screen is slowly disappearing.\nA voice user interface (VUI) already exists on most mobile devices. Whether we say \u201cOK Google\u201d or \u201cHey Siri,\u201d our devices and apps already blur the line between GUIs and \u201cscreenless UIs.\u201d We talk to our devices and they speak back to us. Voice-integrated chatbots are also appearing in various apps.\nWhether people want to control their smart home with voice, need the latest traffic, news, and sports, or just want to set multiple timers for different tasks, intelligent voice-enabled assistants are ready to help. Using voice recognition and natural language processing (NLP), many Google apps already spring into action with a voice command if a user wants to translate a phrase into French, search for a nearby place to eat, or find anything at all on the web.\nWhat this rising trend means is that people will adapt more and more to these kinds of voice-based interactions. Consequently, designers must also evolve with the trend because soon it will become the norm. UX designers\u2019 jobs will shift to designing \u201cscreenless experiences.\u201d We\u2019ll still have our screen-based devices, but it\u2019s going to be more about user flow, efficiency, and visual feedback.\nWords in digital design used to be an afterthought. Most designers are very visual and focus on aesthetics, layout, and visual hierarchy, not text on the screen. In fact, until the very end of a project, when perhaps a \u201cUX writer\u201d comes in or the final copy surfaces somehow, designers still use \u201cLorem Ipsum\u201d placeholders for text in wireframes and prototypes.\nThat\u2019s not the case in great UX design. In order to create a perfectly synced, holistic experience in style and tone, images and words on the screen have to work in unison from the start. Today, writing is just as important as interaction design and visual design. Increasingly, it\u2019s about having a conversation; paying attention to the meaning of the words, the efficacy of communication, the overall tone, and the brand\u2019s \u201cvoice.\u201d\nWords matter and UX copy now matters even more.\nPaying close attention to UX copy is an emerging UX trend, but how that copy is presented on screen is also increasing in importance. This is where typography comes in. Nowadays, every font imaginable can be used in digital design.\nThis article on typography describes it so well: \u201cPossibly with the exception of color, the typeface styles used in a design have a greater impact on the way a user perceives that design than virtually any other individual design element.\u201d\nGreat typography can elevate a design from good to amazing.\nProgressive disclosure is a technique in interaction design where only the most important, necessary, and relevant functions are presented at first, and everything else is relegated to a secondary and tertiary screen. It\u2019s been around for a while on websites (especially web-based SaaS applications) and in desktop software design but has become a huge area of focus for mobile UX designers.\nHowever, there\u2019s good and bad with the technique, and it\u2019s quite a balancing act. On one hand, progressive disclosure helps focus users\u2019 attention on the essential content at the moment of interaction. On the other hand, there are risks \u2014 the main one being an assumption that the designer knows and understands what the most relevant or important user goal in the moment of interaction is. Fortunately, that danger can be minimized by extensive user research and user testing.\nContent vs. chrome is about separating the signal (the most important content) from the noise (anything else in the UI), stripping away anything that\u2019s not necessary \u2014 making content shine and functionality clear. Mobile UX designers have realized that they must prioritize content over visual clutter. To achieve that goal, the mobile app trend is to go \u201cclean\u201d or minimalist as much as possible.\nDespite having been fraught with usability problems, the infamous hamburger menu \u2014 which has become a universal shortcut to hide navigation \u2014 is here to stay because it reduces visual clutter. Today, designers do anything they can to strip away color and visual distractions on mobile in order to present clean visual designs, and in doing so, boost overall UX.\nConnected to the \u201ccontent vs. chrome\u201d mobile UX design trend, using more gestural interactions on mobile is driven by many UX designers\u2019 desire to present a visually clean yet highly functional interface. The potential danger that designers should keep in mind is the use of \u201chidden gestural interactions\u201d where people have no clue that interaction is available \u2014 which is a big no-no.\nThe \u201clack of a signifier to the affordance,\u201d as UX guru Don Norman would say, is a very similar usability problem to the hamburger menu. Without a strong signifier \u2014 a visual clue \u2014 interaction remains hidden to most people. Savvy UX designers overcome this problem by using subtle animated hints that make it clear what interactions are available.\nAs Jakob Nielsen wrote many years ago in an article on Gestural Interfaces: A Step Backward in Usability: \u201cNorman pointed out that in the rush to develop gestural (or \u201cnatural\u201d) interfaces, well-tested and understood standards of interaction design were being overthrown, ignored, and violated. Yes, new technologies require new methods, but the refusal to follow well-established principles leads to usability disaster.\u201d\nThis isn\u2019t so much a \u201cnew trend\u201d and has been a basic design rule for eons, but because of the deluge of information we\u2019re faced with on a daily basis, it\u2019s become important once again and has been elevated to the level of a new UX design trend. What\u2019s more, it\u2019s a no-brainer when designing for mobile because of their smaller screens.\nIt\u2019s important to always pay close attention to visual hierarchy in UI design. Visual hierarchy determines the order in which people take in and process information, and it\u2019s a vital part of creating an optimal user experience.\nTo provide better user experiences, more and more sites and apps are taking advantage of various built-in mobile functionalities, such as the camera, microphone, speaker, fingerprint scanner, GPS, and so on. When designing mobile apps, astute designers are taking advantage of biometric authentication in order to provide smoother interactions and better security.\nSpeedy checkout on many eCommerce sites has become child\u2019s play due to integrated systems (like Apple Pay and Google Pay) that can be securely authenticated. Mobile voice search and navigation is now a breeze with the built-in microphone, GPS, and speaker, and various barcode-scanning, computer vision, and augmented reality applications are now made possible because of the ubiquitous mobile camera.\nToday, smart UX designers are taking product design to the next level by fully utilizing as many built-in mobile device functionalities as possible.\nAR applications connect both real and virtual worlds by superimposing a computer-generated image on a user\u2019s view of the real world and thereby expanding reality by displaying useful, complementary information on a mobile device.\n\u201cI see AR as being profound\u201d and \u201cAR is going to change everything,\u201d says Tim Cook, CEO of Apple, who is clearly a big fan.\nIt\u2019s the complementary nature of AR that\u2019s important for designers to consider. Many people see it as something that will be an essential part of eCommerce. From virtual makeup and hair to trying on shoes, sunglasses, hats, bags and various outfits, AR in eCommerce is going to be the defining norm. For example, Housecraft uses a mobile device\u2019s camera and the power of augmented reality to let people place fully rendered 3D models anywhere.\nPioneering designers on the cutting edge today are constantly thinking about AR and how it could enhance a product\u2019s design. Can innovative new apps be designed that incorporate AR? Could an existing app benefit from its use?\nFrom cars to fashion to furniture and architecture, in Tim Cook\u2019s words: \u201cI don\u2019t think there is any sector or industry that will be untouched by AR.\u201d\nEverything around us has been designed in some way, and all design ultimately produces an emotion. We experience an emotional reaction to our environment moment-by-moment; a like or a dislike, elation, joy, frustration. We \u201cfeel\u201d it. It\u2019s personal.\nEmotional design took center stage in 2018. Whether employing neuroscience, persuasive design, or the triad of emotional design (visceral, behavioral, and reflective), product designers are realizing more and more that users are human, and digital interactions produce both positive and negative emotions.\nToday, successful brands connect with users more effectively through storytelling and a narrative and aim to be more conversational (see below). Successful digital products tend to feel more natural \u2014 less cold, less digital. UX designers strive to eliminate frustrations, but in addition, aim to find opportunities that bring customers pleasure and turn critical moments into positive emotional experiences.\nWhen it makes sense, well-executed animations can make a UI feel more natural and can create a more personal, engaged emotional experience, but only if designed to enhance the experience. There are far too many pointless UI animations found on Dribbble that serve absolutely no purpose. For that reason, fancy animation simply for the sake of showing off is a cheap trick and not something UX designers worth their salt would want in their designs.\nAccording to Gartner, chatbots will power 85% of all customer service interactions by the year 2020. The average person will have more conversations with bots than with their partner. (Now that\u2019s a little unsettling!)\nBrands want to connect more deeply with customers \u2014 tell stories, form narratives and have \u201cconversations.\u201d A conversational user interface is often a chatbot \u2014 software that mimics a conversation with a real person via text or voice.\nDesigning chatbots requires a big adjustment in the way designers think about these new UIs because chatbot design has its own set of pitfalls. Though designers have a wide range of tools and skills at their fingertips, they must adjust their perspective in order to adapt to the shift and make the effort to improve their competency with conversational interfaces.\nAdvanced personalization means delivering hyper-localized, super-personalized content and tailor-made UIs based on a whole host of factors. It\u2019s the opposite of one size fits all. It\u2019s about delivering what people desire in the moment, contextually; the right things, at the right time, in the right way. It\u2019s about giving all users the best experience possible.\nThe widespread deployment of artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) is already enabling more advanced personalization of digital content and eCommerce. Increasingly, consuming news and sports, checking the weather and traffic, and shopping online for groceries will be a lot smoother and more personalized using predictive analytics, anticipatory design, and tailored UIs. Tailored user interfaces make it possible to deliver experiences that include all people regardless of limitations or disabilities.\nWith the help of their UX designers, innovative companies will soon be launching products that use AI to enable more natural interactions and provide more personalized experiences. Designers may miss out unless they get ahead of the tech curve and consider how these new technologies could be taken advantage of in order to heighten the UX of digital products.\nIf Google doesn\u2019t think you need something at the moment, it won\u2019t be displayed. It\u2019s the embodiment of anticipatory design.\nIn this day and age, HD-quality videos and high-resolution images are showcased on beautiful edge-to-edge screens everywhere. YouTube lets people go full-screen with HD videos that cover the iPhone X\u2019s entire screen for an awesome experience. Mobile devices such as the Galaxy S9 and iPhone X allow \u201cframeless design,\u201d full-screen app experiences that are a force behind the trend of extending visual elements to fill the screen.\nIt\u2019s critical that designers make sure the user interface is clean and minimalist \u2014 free from clutter and any unnecessary navigation elements that may distract users\u2019 attention \u2014 and that all content (images and videos) is HD quality. The main idea behind the full-screen experience is that nothing should stand between the user and the content.\nNearly one in four users will abandon a mobile app after using it just once. Good onboarding that improves user retention makes a great first impression, gives users a quick introduction, and clearly communicates its value proposition.\nUser onboarding has become widespread on mobile. Maybe even a little too much. The new mobile UX design trend is a more seamless kickstart to the freshly-installed app, which means fewer onboarding screens and tutorials. What this means for designers is more focus on really understanding who the users are and really designing experiences that are intuitive \u2014 so no tutorials needed. It works \u201cright out of the box.\u201d\nA user interface is like a joke: If you have to explain it, it doesn\u2019t work.\nWhat not to do right away: Don\u2019t ask users to allow notifications or access to their location, contacts, camera or microphone, etc., or ask them to sign up until they\u2019re well into using the app.\nSome UX designers may resist design trends because they don\u2019t want to be seen as \u201cfollowers.\u201d However, although keeping up with UX design trends can be a trap if not done judiciously, keeping abreast of what is current is crucial. Doing so can help a UX designer to become, or continue to be, contemporary. Additionally, typically filtered through UX design experiments, UX design trends have been proved to work, and as such, they can boost UX designers\u2019 efforts to meet people\u2019s high expectations.\nSome UX design trends will become the norm, and some will simply fade away. Through a process of ruthless elimination, only the strongest and most useful will survive, which is great for advancing the art and science of exceptional user experience design.\nOriginally published at www.toptal.com\nFollow me on Twitter for UX tidbits\n", "claps": "2K claps", "author": "Miklos Philips", "comments": [], "link": "https://hackernoon.com/ux-trends-2018-a-retrospective-356bd10615a4"}, {"title": "Evolving Product Design Principles at Bukalapak \u2013 Bukalapak Design \u2013 Medium", "num_comments": 1, "tags": ["design principles", "product design", "collaboration", "user experience", "design"], "reading_time": 6, "text": "As our product portfolio and team continue to grow, we need to be more intentional about our design decisions.

But, where to start?\nLet\u2019s take a step back. At its core, principles help the team avoid \u201cmistakes\u201d due to unintentional design decisions that make problems on the product occurred. That said, we come to a realization to use problems as a starting point and later explore the guiding principles to help us avoid those problems.\nHowever, there are wide-range of problems. Asking a general question like, \u201cWhat do you think our product\u2019s problems are?\u201d can make people lost sight at what\u2019s important. At our session, we were being specific that we want to focus on the user-experience problems that frustrate users. From my experience, this session is where the researchers and the product owners will step up the most.\nThroughout the process, there is a recurring challenge: how did we know we were on the right track? After much discussion and benchmarking research, we came up with a couple of criteria that we could use to test our principles against in practice. These tests were used to ensure our end-result would pass the minimal standard for \u201cgood.\u201d\nA good design principle should be much more than a motto or truism. Basically, when you flip the principle to the opposite, it should still be something that reasonable person to believe. For example:\n\u201cNovelty, Useful, Simple.\u201d These principles are catchy, but they can be interpreted differently depends on the reader\u2019s perspective. Thus, it is important to be precise in their explanation so as to prevent confusion. For example:\nGood principles are not only memorable, but also unique in that they provide a distinct character that helps the product, team, or company differentiate itself from the competition. For example:\nWe believe every design team must aim to develop principles that give differentiator to the product, widely applied, are concise and memorable, and are more than mere truisms or cliche\u0301s. However, while these are key attributes of quality principles, it is important not to forget that the principles developed for a design team or product must align with the overarching corporate goals, strategy, and mission as well. Using simple tests, it is possible to ensure that the principles developed to meet a minimal set of quality criteria to keep the team focused on what matters and always aimed in the right, strategic direction.\nWe aim to guide users by making the essential information ready at hand and remind everyone that it\u2019s okay to hide the secondary information and not over-clarifying everything because users won\u2019t be able to process everything at once.\nWe don\u2019t measure the success by the number of features that we ship. We measure the success by how well and efficient we fulfill users\u2019 needs. Whenever possible, use research to build empathy and understand the users to inform decisions.\nDon\u2019t reinvent the wheel; use a similar experience to support users to achieve similar tasks. However, when the purpose of the experience is different, it is important to make it explicitly different. By making a cohesive experience, our product would feel intuitive and not require a lot of relearning.\nOur products should be crafted with care to give users great experiences. Form and function should work together to achieve elegance. Default to standard and innovate only when it\u2019s worth it. All aesthetic decisions should be driven by a clear purpose.\nWe understand to improve the whole experience of our product is a long game. However, we are really excited to see where these principles will bring us to. In a daily basis, we hope this set of principles can help teams make decisions when there are a few concepts on the table. On the macro level, we want the principles to guide us and create a cohesive experience and to reflect our character.\nDo these values align with yours?

Depending on a project, finding the right font can take a few minutes or a few days.\nHere are seven key factors to consider when searching for an appropriate typeface:\nA font you select should embody the character and spirit of your brand. Try to match the font style to your brand\u2019s character.\nIt\u2019s evident that it\u2019s better for a typeface to be clear and legible, rather than so unreadable. If people have to spend extra time to understand what have written, then they will disregard your design.\nAvoid using fancy fonts or uppercase text in large bodies of text as it forces strain on the reader\u2019s eye. It\u2019s better to use decorative typefaces only for titles and headlines.\nAlso, it\u2019s vital to choose a typeface that works well in multiple sizes and weights to maintain readability in every size (check that the typeface you choose is legible on smaller screens!)\nTry to avoid fonts that use a cursive script, such as Vivaldi (in the example below) \u2014 although they are beautiful, they are difficult to read.\nUsually, one of the first determinations to be made when selecting a typeface for text is serif or sans?\nWhile the decision can be based on several key points, one of the most important points is the length of your copy. Generally, serif typefaces are easier to read for lengthy copy than sans. Serif fonts help the eye travel across a line, especially if lines are long.\nBut it\u2019s also important to consider your target audience. Sans is preferable for young children, or anyone just learning to read. Sans is also good for readers with certain visual impairments.\nAlso, it\u2019s a safe bet to use \u201cweb safe fonts\u201d \u2014 fonts that are supported by all major web browsers by default. Here are some safe sans typefaces you might start with:\nAnd here are some safe serif typefaces:\nSome fonts are members of \u2018superfamilies\u2019 \u2014 they come along with a selection of different styles and weights that give designers more creative freedom. For example, the Helvetica Neue superfamily includes the following sub-fonts:\nWhen choosing a font for your designs, you need to know how large a font family needs to be to meet your project typographic requirements. For many projects it\u2019s enough to have two weights with italics, while others might require additional versions to create good visual hierarchy.\nMuch of the time one typeface is all you will need to use in your designs. However, there are certain occasions where you\u2019ll want to use multiple typefaces (i.e. one for body text and another for a title).\nHere are a few tips for font pairing:\nAvoid using more than 2\u20133 fonts in your design. Each time when you think you need a new font, play with different font sizes for existing fonts.\nThe whole idea of using multiple fonts in design is creating a visual diversity. That\u2019s why there\u2019s no point choosing two fonts that look identical. In fact, the more similar fonts are, the more likely they will clash.\nWhen you choose to use multiple typefaces, make sure the typefaces you\u2019re using have substantial contrasting differences. But remember that the contrast is not the same as conflict. The ideal combination of fonts should create harmony.\nFollow a simple rule of thumb \u2014find the two typefaces that have one thing in common but are otherwise vastly different. Combining serif with sans serif is a classic move.\nThe key thing when combining two very different fonts is establishing a clear hierarchy between the two \u2014 one font should be more prominent than the other. And this can be achieved by varying the size and weight of each typeface.\nHere is a collection of tools that will help you find and pair the fonts for your design project:\nFollow UX Planet: Twitter| Facebook\n", "claps": "247 claps", "author": "Nick Babich", "comments": [], "link": "https://uxplanet.org/7-things-to-remember-when-selecting-fonts-for-your-design-ec1e592266c5"}, {"title": "Responsive grids and how to actually use them \u2013 UX Collective", "num_comments": 2, "tags": ["user experience", "ui", "visual design", "design process", "design"], "reading_time": 10, "text": "You looked around, you saw all the arguments on why to use a grid, how to set one up, and you\u2019re totally on board with all of that, but nobody told you how to use one. Same.\nTechnically this article can be applied to grids in print but for our purposes, I\u2019m specifically talking about web responsive grids for desktop, tablet, and mobile. Before we get into the nitty-gritty, let\u2019s get our terminology right.\nField Elements are your blocks of design, whether that be text, image, or a combination of both. Background colors don\u2019t really count as field elements unless they are a container for your text/image. I\u2019ve seen the name field element be interchangeable with units, elements, parent containers \u2014 they\u2019re all the same.\nColumns are the thick colored blocks that make up the content width of your design. Field elements are to sit on a certain number of columns. Traditionally in a design system, the column width doesn\u2019t change but the number of columns change from 12 on desktop, to 8 on tablet, and to 4 on mobile. You can literally use anything you want, but most grids have 60\u201380px column widths. Choosing a column width that works for you is the most important since it\u2019s the main determinant of your content width.\nGutters are the space between the columns. 20px is a common gutter size, and this spacing will be really important when you have a masonry design or a grid of card elements, a simple example being a photo gallery. Some systems increase the gutter width as you increase in device width, but it\u2019s also okay to keep it fixed.\nSide margins also known as outside gutters are the amount of white space outside of your content width. For a more accommodating design, the side margins increase as you go up in device width. Side margins on mobile are usually 20\u201330px, and vary a lot between tablet and desktop.\nHere are some basic guidelines, in design there aren\u2019t any hard and fast rules anyway.\nThe idea is that field elements must sit on some number of columns. You can split it up however you like, 6 and 6, 3 by 4, 4 by 3, whatever. In the example, I am showing a profile card sitting on different number of columns.\nOk cool, so that\u2019s easy. There will be times where you want to divide a section by a certain number, and you find that if you actually sit them perfectly on the grid they end up looking too wide. See the classic \u201cHow To\u201d pattern below:\nIf we were to sit them on the grids, the text stretches too long. The optimal positioning is actually not on any of the grids at all (see below). This is okay too, as long as you understand that the whole of the element is actually an invisible, larger container.\nYou did actually divide the section by 3, but you also gave it invisible padding on the inside. When you hand off your designs to a developer, they should intuitively already know this, so this is more for you to understand how to actually divide things equally.\nYour elements should sit within the columns and not be bleeding into the gutters. You CANNOT leave things in the gutters, that defeats the purpose of the grid.\nNow there will be moments where you want to split up your design or card exactly half-half with an image and text, in which you get this awkward situation where the image doesn\u2019t fall on a column and the text is forced to accommodate in a weird way. Fear not, this is okay, as long as the \u201cparent\u201d container, or like the bigger picture of the object sits within the columns.\nAll of your important content should fit in the content width, hence content width. It will feel strange at first because if you\u2019re not used to using a grid, you will feel like the grid is the artboard, and that you need to add padding to your designs. So that\u2019s exactly what the side margins are for, they are the extra padding to your designs. \u201cBut when the browser shrinks down, then it\u2019ll just come neck to neck with the content width, and that\u2019ll look weird, right?\u201d No, that is not what happens. Depending on how it\u2019s coded, either your content inside the grid will start to scale proportionally and the side margins will be fixed, or the side margins will scale at the same time with the content.\nSo if somebody says \u201cI need a design at 1200px width,\u201d that does not mean your design is literally 1200px wide. That means your content width is somewhere like 960px sitting inside the artboard of 1200px so that you still have space for side margins.\nThis is an exception to rule 4 \u2014 when you have a background color or image that is full bleed. In this case, you would want to pull it outside of the grid in your mockup, and with the help of the grid and your side margins, this is understood by developers as an element being full width.\nIf you have an image that is meant to bleed off the page like a decoration, and you are ok with it getting cut off, that can also go off the grid.\nHeaders and sometimes footers can have their own exceptions too, they\u2019re not considered part of the content. Some designs have them pinned to the edges of the browsers, some like to keep it in the content width. It\u2019s really up to you and your situation. The benefit of keeping them in your content width is that it doesn\u2019t get crazy far when a user is viewing your site on a super wide monitor. The benefit of keeping them pinned to the browser is you have more space for navigational elements.\nIn a traditional design grid, the column widths and gutters stay the same, just the number of columns change. Why? And how does that work? This was to make things easier when you designed. If a set of three cards sat on 4 columns each on desktop, on tablet you would show two cards and wrap the third one so that it\u2019d show on a second row. Yay! You didn\u2019t need to do any resizing, because you already knew that it sat on four columns. On mobile the answer is easy too, you would just show one card, and the rest stacked beneath it. If you wanted, you could also get creative and choose to only show one card on mobile, or do a horizontal scroll. These breakpoints are the point of reference in code.\nIn reality, the web must render for any browser width. Let\u2019s say for example you have a large monitor that sees things at 1600px wide, your desktop design is at 1200px wide, tablet is at 768px wide, and mobile is at 360px wide. So right now what you\u2019re seeing is a design with content width of something smaller than 1200px, with a ton of margin because you\u2019re looking with a big monitor. But what happens for when your browser is one pixel smaller, at 1199px?\nIf your developer codes a fixed grid, when you shrink from desktop to tablet, like you\u2019re at the 900px browser width, you\u2019ll see no change and your designs will just look cut off. Or, you\u2019ll see no change and the side margins will just shrink. But wait as soon as you hit that 768px breakpoint, the design will snap into place, and things will look right for tablet. If you go smaller than that, the same thing will happen, your design will look the same until you reach another breakpoint.\nNow comes the beauty of fluid grids! As you shrink the window, things will change dynamically, your text is wrapping, and elements are getting narrower. However, these elements of yours still won\u2019t change layout until you hit the next breakpoint that you designed.\nSo what I\u2019m trying to say is, the breakpoints that you design are just reference points at the end of the day. That\u2019s why columns and gutters don\u2019t change in grids, because we want to make it easy to create consistency for the designer when we need to think about the layout.\nIt\u2019s also common practice to use a combination of fluid and fixed grids in the experience. Sites usually are fluid when it goes down to mobile size because of the many different device sizes.\nAgain, you don\u2019t have to stick to the traditional 12, 8, 4 grid, and it doesn\u2019t even have to be 20px gutters. Below are some inspiration for cool ways to use a grid in your designs!\nNot only is this site designed really well, they actually take advantage of showing their own grid system in the design to make it look even cooler. In this system there are no gutters, and there are 8 thick columns.\nThey have a system where there are no side margins, no gutters, and instead the page is split into two halves. The content fits within these halves and almost acts as two separate artboards.\nThe way you use the grid can be up to you. You can use it for the main section and leave out the sidebar. In Wordpress\u2019 example, most of the content is in the center of the page and there is also a side bar on the left.\nYour content and grid doesn\u2019t always have to start in the center! For the Mockup Club, the content is off to the left.\nI\u2019m pretty sure Instagram can get away with 6 thick columns on desktop.\nThe goal here was to provide some guidance on how to use grids in responsive design. I know for me it took me many years, and a decent amount of coding to understand how grids worked. I searched YouTube videos and read plenty of articles, but everyone focused on why it was important and less about the \u201crules\u201d of how to use the grid.\nThe best thing you can do is to start noticing how other sites align elements on their page, and you will start to see the patterns. To help with your understanding, here are some design systems that outline their grid usage:\nGoogle\u2019s Material Design System\nIntuit\u2019s Design System\nIBM\u2019s Carbon Design System\n...And here\u2019s huge list of other systems you can look through\nAfter fully understanding how grids work, I\u2019ve become a better designer because I knew how my designs would translate between the breakpoints. I also could justify my designs more, and make them pixel perfect. Both of those led to a more consistent, cleaner design, which really elevates the end product when you have a flow that goes from screen to screen. I recommend finding a grid that works for you and your development team, and make sure that all the designers on the same team are using the grid the same way.\n", "claps": "760 claps", "author": "Christie Tang", "comments": [], "link": "https://uxdesign.cc/responsive-grids-and-how-to-actually-use-them-970de4c16e01"}, {"title": "2019 UI/UX Design Trends You Should Know \u2013 Akveo Engineering \u2013 Medium", "num_comments": "unspecified", "tags": ["trends", "ux design", "ui", "ui ux design", "design"], "reading_time": 6, "text": "The designer needs to stay on top of the latest design trends. The work style should change and evolve to keep work fresh and resonate with clients and products. The 2019 year collected a lot of trends from the last year and also add some new ones. So take a look at the juiciest trends for this year that I\u2019ve picked out.\nCustom illustrations with bold, vibrant colors and funny stylized people are coming back in 2019 and become the main trend of the year. According to statistics, this type of content can convert 7 times better than any other type of visual content. Today companies take more advantage of custom illustrations. Using custom illustrations, the company demonstrates the uniqueness of the values of their brand. This approach in design helps businesses get closer to their customers by making their experience with a brand more personalized. Without a doubt, this custom illustrations are expensive but opting for them you'll get a lot of bang for your buck. The most popular directions are illustrations with simple shapes and isometric forms.\nDesign becomes more digitized, and designers and artists following these trends bring complex forms of color to the real world. And liquid, holographic, chromatic forms, and glitters are everywhere, including the UI design. It concerns not only graphics but also typography.\n\u0421heeky and bold typography is extremely popular this year. In many cases, typography is replacing background images and presents the main element of the page. Also, this trend call to another typography trend \u2014 Outline typography. These trends are often mixed together and combined with bold and very large bodies.\nThe dark themes started to prevail after the Mojave update was released. Dark side attracts users and world-known companies have released software updates with dark themes.\nNot for the first year motion design keeps in trends. The public like funny, malleable animation. The UI design also uses motion in different loading cases. Complex, entertaining animation hooks the user, and also allows personalize a user experience.\n3D design is one more prominent trend. Now it\u2019s not only a static design but also an animated 3d graphic. Various simulations of natural materials, the movement of objects and mind-blowing combinations of objects in compositions pique users\u2019 interest and make them stay.\nGradients used in last year\u2019s designs tend to be a bit outdated and those are about to fade away. But gradients didn\u2019t die. The new, better gradients are coming. They will be using rich, flashy, solid colors.\nIn contrast to the resurgent color schemes popular in 2018, the minimalist design is coming. The severity of the interfaces is chosen by the product companies, emphasizing the static nature, elitism and the high quality of their services and products. Minimalism is achieved by using a monochrome color palette and bold font turns.\nHow many times did you hear \u201cOK, Google?\u201d recently. Google, Alexa, and Siri are our day-to-day helpers. Almost 50% of all searches are being made using the voice because there are many benefits such as no need to use your hands.\nPeople use micro-iterations in all software products. Micro-iterations provide a more intuitive perception of the interface. With fluid animation makes, the interface looks more dynamic and lighter and it also makes everyday interactions more entertaining.\nThis method makes users think that your project is fast. While your app is loading skeleton screens give you the feeling of smooth work, fluency and accuracy of it doesn\u2019t leave the user.\nWith the output of buttonless phones, where the entire surface of the phone\u2019s front panel occupies the screen, gesture control has become an absolutely necessary approach to navigation. Now everyone wants to reduce the number of controls and increase the intuitive gesture control.\nLast years the smartphones that were released by top mobile companies get large enough screens (5'7-\u20196'2). This thing makes our fingers and hands practice at stretching. Thumb-oriented design transports all important and frequently used controls to the bottom of the screen. You can rich fundamental parts of your app using only your thumb, without the help of your other hand. But frankly speaking, the moving of this trend started a long time ago with the emergence of bottom navigation menus.\nDo you remember background videos as the main trend of 2015\u20132017 years? Now it\u2019s time to let go. Background videos are not trending anymore, users prefer fast data load and sites without delays.\nPatterns with a mixture of geometric shapes are becoming less popular this year. They captured designer\u2019s hearts for a long time, now they are replaced by custom illustrations and craft patterns.\nMy team and I are working on a product that allows you to create UI for your applications with cutting-edge design and it doesn\u2019t require knowledge of coding. This product is useful for any person who is relevant to creating application/mockups/testing of concepts/etc, from designers and developers to non-tech people as well.\nUI Bakery \u2014 the first low-code platform which allows creating branded frontend apps based on a custom Design System, without locking you to proprietary software.Come join us now as early adopter at uibakery.io.\n", "claps": "1K claps", "author": "Viktoria Romanovskaya", "comments": [], "link": "https://medium.com/akveo-engineering/2019-ui-ux-design-trends-you-should-know-268b6bdbc0e3"}, {"title": "Beyond critique\u2014fostering a culture around it \u2013 Design at IBM \u2013 Medium", "num_comments": "unspecified", "tags": ["user experience", "mentorship", "critique", "sharing", "design"], "reading_time": 6, "text": "Get out of your comfort zone and break team silos\nCo-written by Maui Francis and Alex Swain\nLet\u2019s face it, the word \u201ccritique\u201d gives most people flashbacks of professors or other leads at some point ripping your work apart that made you question whether or not you were truly cut out to be in the profession. Those kind of negative experiences can shape our perception of critiques more so than positive ones, as we would rather avoid the potential to be judged or feel insulted.\nHowever, we should all be aware of how critique should be a foundational part of your design process and all the benefits it provides, so why aren\u2019t people doing it more? We noticed quite a few teams at IBM didn\u2019t regularly do crits or would tell us how it was never useful. So we asked...\nWe knew we weren\u2019t pioneering some never done before effort of trying to tackle the issue of critique. So we began by speaking with those that have gone down that road before and the lessons they learned.\nWhat we learned is that everyone had great ideas and methods of structuring a critique with rules and guidelines in order to be more useful, but what we found is there was a missing element...\nThe human connection of wanting to share\nAs large as IBM is and the many design teams across different organizations, it was crucial to understand why people were hesitant to share and connect outside of their respective teams, even when they were less than 10ft away.\nSo what did we do? We held a workshop and invited not only design leads and designers, but others across different design groups who normally don\u2019t interact with each other.\nOur main goal was to get a sense of why teams or individuals were hesitant to engage with other teams, reluctant to participate in design shares or critiques, what about those activities make them uncomfortable, and what ideas would make them better whether they were in a small or large environment.\nSome of the workshop activities we utilized:\nThe workshop fostered a lot of great discussion and perspectives along with some excellent ideas, but these are some of the main themes:\nAfter the workshop, we began to synthesize the insights which started to paint a picture of not only the components that needed to be in place for meaningful conversations to be had, it also surfaced the lack of excitement to want to participate, which is key to building a community.\nOne thing we didn\u2019t want to do is reinvent what was already out there in relation to rules and guides for how to conduct crits, but we did see a need to supplement them with guiding principles around what we identified as the four phases of critique:\n01. Excitement & Expectations (Preparing the session)\nCrits don\u2019t have to be all business, share your personalities with pecha kuchas, external projects, or work you found that was cool on occasion. Utilize different locations outside the conference room to change things up and share your work along with setting expectations on what kind of feedback you\u2019re looking for beforehand.\n02. Honesty and Structure (Conducting the session)\nCreate a judgement free environment, have a neutral guide/facilitator that helps keeps the session focused and define the type of conversation (formal / informal) with guidelines to keep the dialogue meaningful. Build trust, not resentment as a way to elevate your designs.\n03. Equality & Empathy (Participating in the session)\nHave empathy for the designer and the goals they are trying to achieve. To make the conversation comfortable, leave the org structure at the door, everyone should have an equal voice.\n04. Empowerment & Connectivity (After the session)\nThis is your opportunity to digest the feedback provided and either react, ignore, or follow up with questions. Know that you are empowered to make the decision to do with any feedback as you see fit, you decide your path. Follow up with individuals that participated and those that may have made an impact and thank them to help build the community through outreach.\nWith the above principles coupled with prescriptive critique rules and guidelines, it helped provide a base for the teams to use in order to address a lot of the issues we found across teams. However, we still needed to break down the silos and make it feel more like a community.\nWith the principles in place, they needed to be followed by actions, and actions usually need planning. It\u2019s like coordinating family members for the holidays.\nWe needed a plan that could get teams to spark that desire to connect and share with their respective teams since they normally work on multiple projects concurrently and may not be fully aware of who is doing what and also with others teams for better awareness of what they are working on or already solved.\nTo make it happen, we came up with three methods to share and critique, which include:\nTeam JamsThe smallest in scale for sharing and critique. It\u2019s an opportunity for a team to meet in a consistent cadence and share the current state of work and/or look for feedback regarding anything that needs another set of eyes on.\nBlock PartyA way to get to know your neighbors. Block Parties help to get to know other teams (informally) and share patterns or provide critique from others with a fresh perspective. These are for two or more teams get together once a month, that may work on similar problems or completely different areas of focus. This should be coordinated by the leads beforehand to determine what the goal /benefit is and the structure.\nCritnik*A family affair where we can gather with the entire design group as a community once a month or every quarter over the course of a few hours and voluntarily share our passions, interests, and work. It can\u2019t be work all the time, so this allows everyone to share cool things they\u2019ve seen, created for work, or personally that others may find interesting or would benefit from. This needs a bit of planning to provide coordination / structure and the programming.\n* Critniks have nothing to do with critique, it was coined from combining Critique and Picnics (we provide food for these events), but we liked the name and it was catchy, so it stuck. :)\nCreating a new culture of critique within your design group is not easy, there\u2019s some work involved and unless people understand and witness the value of it, it will feel forced and will never be embraced. This was key in how we approached developing a method that worked for us, by listening to the hopes and fears of designers in regards to critique and what they wanted to get out of it.\nThis approach worked for us to help address most of the issues we identified, but may not work for you unless there are similarities to the issues we learned our design group had. I would encourage you to do your own research and see what kind of possibilities you come up with and share it out once you determine what does work. Don\u2019t get discouraged if it doesn\u2019t work right away, treat it like any other experience and continually iterate on better solutions \u2014 the benefits are worth the effort!\nGo out and share!\n", "claps": "805 claps", "author": "Alex Swain", "comments": [], "link": "https://medium.com/design-ibm/beyond-critique-fostering-a-culture-around-it-27428140196b"}, {"title": "3 Awesome Visualization Techniques for every dataset", "num_comments": 2, "tags": ["education", "towards data science", "data science", "python", "data visualization"], "reading_time": 8, "text": "Visualizations are awesome. However, a good visualization is annoyingly hard to make.\nMoreover, it takes time and effort when it comes to present these visualizations to a bigger audience.\nWe all know how to make Bar-Plots, Scatter Plots, and Histograms, yet we don\u2019t pay much attention to beautify them.\nThis hurts us \u2014 our credibility with peers and managers. You won\u2019t feel it now, but it happens.\nAlso, I find it essential to reuse my code. Every time I visit a new dataset do I need to start again? Some reusable ideas of graphs that can help us to find information about the data FAST.\nIn this post, I am also going to talk about 3 cool visual tools:\nIn short, this post is about useful and presentable graphs.\nI will be using data from FIFA 19 complete player dataset on kaggle \u2014 Detailed attributes for every player registered in the latest edition of FIFA 19 database.\nSince the Dataset has many columns, we will only focus on a subset of categorical and continuous columns.\nThis is a nicely formatted data, yet we need to do some preprocessing to the Wage and Value columns(as they are in Euro and contain strings) to make them numeric for our subsequent analysis.\nIn Simple terms, Correlation is a measure of how two variables move together.\nFor example, In the real world, Income and Spend are positively correlated. If one increases the other also increases.\nAcademic Performance and Video Games Usage is negatively correlated. Increase in one predicts a decrease in another.\nSo if our predictor variable is positively or negatively correlated with our target variable, it is valuable.\nCorrelations among different variables are a pretty good thing to do when we try to understand our data.\nWe can create a pretty good correlation plot using Seaborn easily.\nBut do you notice any problem?\nYes, this graph only calculates Correlation between Numerical columns.\nWhat if my target variable is Club or Position?\nI want to be able to get a correlation among three different cases, and we use the following metrics of correlation to calculate these:\nWe already have this in the form of Pearson\u2019s Correlation which is a measure of how two variables move together. This Ranges from [-1,1]\nWe will use Cramer\u2019s V for categorical-categorical cases. It is the intercorrelation of two discrete variables and used with variables having two or more levels. It is a symmetrical measure as in the order of variable does not matter. Cramer(A,B) == Cramer(B,A).\nFor Example: In our dataset, Club and Nationality must be somehow correlated.\nLet us check this using a stacked graph which is an excellent way to understand distribution between categorical vs. categorical variables. We use a subset of data since there are a lot of nationalities and club in this data.\nWe keep only the best teams(Kept FC Porto just for more diversity in the sample)and the most common nationalities.\nClub preference says quite a bit about Nationality: knowing the former helps a lot in predicting the latter.\nWe can see if a player belongs to England, it is more probable he plays in Chelsea or Manchester United and not in FC Barcelona or Bayern Munchen or Porto.\nSo there is some information present here. Cramer\u2019s V captures the same information.\nIf all clubs have the same proportion of players from every nationality, Cramer\u2019s V is 0.\nIf Every club prefers a single nationality Cramer\u2019s V ==1, for example, all England player play in Manchester United, All Germans in Bayern Munchen and so on.\nIn all other cases, it ranges from [0,1]\nWe will use the Correlation Ratio for categorical-continuous cases.\nWithout getting into too much Maths, it is a measure of Dispersion.\nFor Example:\nSuppose we have two columns from our dataset: SprintSpeed and Position:\nAs you can see these numbers are pretty predictive of the bucket they fall into and thus high Correlation Ratio.\nIf I know the sprint speed is more than 85, I can definitely say this player plays at ST.\nThis ratio also ranges from [0,1]\nThe code to do this is taken from the dython package. I won\u2019t write too much into code which you can anyway find in my Kaggle Kernel. The final result looks something like:\nIsn\u2019t it Beautiful?\nWe can understand so much about Football just by looking at this data. For Example:\nMoreover, so much info we could find with this simple graph which was not visible in the typical correlation plot without Categorical Variables.\nI leave it here. One can look more into the chart and find more meaningful results, but the point is that this makes life so much easier to find patterns.\nWhile I talked a lot about correlation, it is a fickle metric.\nTo understand what I mean let us see one example.\nAnscombe\u2019s quartet comprises four datasets that have nearly identical Correlation of 1, yet have very different distributions and appear very different when graphed.\nThus sometimes it becomes crucial to plot correlated data. And see the distributions individually.\nNow we have many columns in our dataset. Graphing them all would be so much effort.\nNo, it is a single line of code.\nPretty Good. We can see so much in this graph.\nCaveat: No categorical columns.\nCan we do better? We always can.\nSo much more info. Just by adding the hue parameter as a categorical variable Club.\nI already know some of the points on the Wage/Value Subplot.\nThe blue point for wage 500k is Messi. Also, the orange point having more value than Messi is Neymar.\nAlthough this hack still doesn\u2019t solve the Categorical problem, I have something cool to look into categorical variables distribution. Though individually.\nHow to see the relationship between categorical and numerical data?\nEnter into picture Swarmplots, just like their name. A swarm of points plotted for each category with a little dispersion on the y-axis to make them easier to see.\nThey are my current favorite for plotting such relationships.\nWhy don\u2019t I use Boxplots? Where are the median values? Can I plot that? Obviously. Overlay a bar plot on top, and we have a great looking graph.\nPretty good. We can see the individual points on the graph, see some statistics and understand the wage difference categorically.\nThe far right point is Messi. However, I should not have to tell you that in a text below the chart. Right?\nThis graph is going to go in a presentation. Your boss says. I want to write Messi on this graph. Comes into picture annotations.\nA semblance of normalcy in this crazy world.\nSo to recap, in this post, we talked about calculating and reading correlations between different variable types, plotting correlations between numerical data and Plotting categorical data with Numerical data using Swarmplots. I love how we can overlay chart elements on top of each other in Seaborn.\nAlso if you want to learn more about Visualizations, I would like to call out an excellent course about Data Visualization and applied plotting from the University of Michigan which is a part of a pretty good Data Science Specialization with Python in itself.

But Kate takes art personally: she loves the Dadaists but also thinks they\u2019re a bit cliqueish and silly; in her emails she quotes Rilke and Hurston. She\u2019s one of those students so passionate about writing and literature it makes me feel, briefly, younger to be around her. It also secretly breaks my heart. I once unprofessionally confessed to Kate my misgivings about training her in an art form as archaic as stained glass. She tells me she still thinks about this all the time.\nI know better than to blame myself for Kate\u2019s career choice; she was already doomed to this vocation when I met her. You recognize these students less by their intrinsic talent than by their seriousness of purpose: they allow themselves no other options; they\u2019re in it for the long haul. She recently took a year off from studying law, politics, and economics to take nothing but courses in literature: \u201cThere is something telling me that if I ever do something to save people from the misery that other people have caused them,\u201d she wrote me, \u201cit will be because of what Ibsen teaches me, and not a class on terrorism.\u201d She worries that by obsessively observing and recording she\u2019s missing out on the experience of being alive. I have assured Kate she is more alive than anyone I know.\nBut in this dystopian year 2019, with \u201cthe newspapers dying like huge moths,\u201d as Ray Bradbury predicted in the \u201950s, \u201cLiterature\u201d a niche category among all the Book-Shaped Products\u00a9 on sale, and \u201cthe discourse\u201d limited to 280 characters, how can I justify luring guileless young people into squandering their passion and talents on a life of letters? It\u2019s not just that writing is an unmonetizable profession \u2014 Kate knows that much already \u2014 I worry it\u2019s obsolete. Late in life, the novelist James Salter despaired of the post-literate civilization he saw already arriving: \u201cThe new populations will live in hives of concrete on a diet of film, television, and the internet.\u201d Trying to read something like To the Lighthouse with attention spans stunted by stroboscopic overdoses of Instagram/Twitter/Reddit/Imgur might as well be climbing Kilimanjaro. These very words will likely vanish from your head within hours, driven out by the latest presidential obscenity or Mueller revelation, the next episode of Atlanta, a new Maru video.\n\u201cThey speak about the dumbing of America as a foregone thing, already completed,\u201d wrote Michael Herr, \u201cbut, duh, it\u2019s a process, and we haven\u2019t seen anything yet.\u201d That was in 1999, long before what people are calling, with the chilling nonchalance of a fait accompli, the \u201cpost-truth era.\u201d Consensual reality is as abandoned as Friendster; everyone now gets to curate their own truths like Spotify playlists. You can convincingly Photoshop a Parkland survivor tearing up the Constitution, or CGI \u201cdeepfake\u201d footage of Kat Dennings having sex with you. Journalists routinely get death threats, while the two most widely trusted institutions in America are the police and the military, who can be relied upon to obediently massacre us on command. I\u2019m still haunted by an essay speculating that, if the President were proved to have committed impeachable crimes, we would face \u201can epistemological crisis\u201d in this country: What if his supporters simply declined to buy the evidence?\nOf course people have always claimed that the culture is in decline, that the age of true art is past, that each generation is more illiterate, vulgar, and stupid than the last. But the constancy of this claim throughout history can obscure, from the limited perspective of a single short lifetime, that it may be true. We lack the historical elevation to tell whether this current darkness is just a passing reactionary spasm, like the McCarthy aberration, or part of a longer, more inexorable Gibbonian decline. \u201cI know Writing isn\u2019t dead and I believe it\u2019ll only be once we all are for good,\u201d Kate wrote me. I just hope the latter date is further away than it sometimes seems. But even an apocalypse needs chroniclers. One of my colleagues says she\u2019s writing for that (possibly brief) interval between the end of the internet and our extinction, when our grandchildren may turn to our words to try to understand what happened. I keep remembering Agnolo di Tura writing, during the Black Death: \u201cso many died that all believed it was the end of the world.\u201d He had buried five children by then, and had every reason to believe it was true; still, he wrote it down.\nOr maybe it\u2019s not civilization that\u2019s in decline; maybe it\u2019s just me. Talking to Kate also makes me feel older, uncomfortably aware of the distance between her searing idealism and my own guttering disillusion. Anyone who makes the mistake of turning their passion into a vocation gets to watch it turn, like gold transmuting into lead, into a job. You start out motivated by pure, childish things: the pleasure of finding something you do well, of telling stories or making jokes. You\u2019re driven by the same fear that drives magnates and despots: the approaching deadline of mortality, the dreadful urgency to make something to prove you were here. These motives gradually get buried under geological layers of bullshit \u2014 reputation, recognition, self-image, money \u2014 until every airport bookstore becomes a warped hall of mirrors confronting you with your own insecurity, petty jealousies, and resentment. Posterity is no less absurd an illusion than an afterlife. A friend of mine recently forwarded me a cache of letters by Raymond Chandler, in which he ruminates, like one of his own weltschmerzy heroes, on the vanity of literary striving: \u201cDo I wish to win the Nobel Prize? [...] I\u2019d have to go to Sweden and dress up and make a speech. Is the Nobel Prize worth all that? Hell, no.\u201d\nWhy, then, do we do it \u2014 spend so much of our brief time alive in this gorgeous world indoors, alone, and typing?\nAfter all my worrying about what to tell Kate, it turned out it was up to her to tell me. \u201cSomehow most people are taught that Art is a way to distract from the terror,\u201d she wrote me, \u201cwhen in fact I think it is the only way to get through it at all.\u201d In other words, all my arguments for writing\u2019s futility are in fact arguments for its necessity. I was never as idealistic as Kate \u2014 or rather, I was never as hopeful; my idealism is too fragile, too easily disappointed. What she and I share is that foolish, ineradicable belief in art and the written word: That there is such a thing as truth, and that it matters when it\u2019s spoken, even if no one listens. Beliefs so frail and indefensible, so easily debunked, that you\u2019d almost have to call them articles of faith. And faith is like courage: Just as courage is acting despite your fear, faith is acting despite your despair.\nThe last time I saw Kate we stopped, on a whim, at the Cathedral of Saint John the Divine and discovered the \u201cAmerican Poet\u2019s Corner,\u201d a chapel dedicated to writers. We stood searching its floor for the names of our favorites, the patron saints of our chosen vocation: Poe and Twain, Fitzgerald and O\u2019Connor, Cummings and Plath. The quotation from O\u2019Connor reads: \u201cI can, with one eye squinted, take it all as a blessing.\u201d I\u2019d likened writing to stained glass, an anachronism, but stained glass is more than an artifact in itself \u2014 it\u2019s a medium, to make the invisible manifest. The sunlight through the cathedral windows cast a warm pastel glow across the flagstones, lending to those graven words the animating blush of illumination.\nA few days ago Kate wrote to let me know she\u2019d been accepted to journalism school, with a full scholarship. She wrote: \u201cLooking forward to it all.\u201d\n", "claps": "6.6K claps", "author": "Timothy Kreider", "comments": [], "link": "https://humanparts.medium.com/why-we-spend-our-lives-indoors-alone-typing-e3b1a98e6f45"}, {"title": "Learn New Skills in 15 Hours: The Essential Guide \u2013 The Startup \u2013 Medium", "num_comments": 9, "tags": ["inspiration", "life lessons", "self improvement", "education", "learning"], "reading_time": 21, "text": "After deliberately learning 40+ news skills in the past 14 months, I uncovered varied ways to make learning new skills enjoyable, useful, and most importantly, life changing.\nHere\u2019s the one thing you should know right away: It\u2019s not as scary or as hard as it seems. I\u2019ll show you the best ways I\u2019ve learned to learn new skills, all in this article.\nA lot of us learn a bunch of new skills on a regular basis, without thinking much about it. Learning a new skill is very much an activity our brain does \u201cwithout our consent\u201d.\nIn this article, I won\u2019t go into the scientific details on what happens in your brain and where. I\u2019ll use common terms like \u201cbrain\u201d and \u201cmemory\u201d, to make this more accessible for everyone to read.\nUltimately, what a skill really is is a series of connections in your brain. As you practice a set of actions, your brain creates these connections for you.\nWhile that may seem like great news, that\u2019s not always the case. The brain doesn\u2019t discern what is good and what is bad for you. That\u2019s how bad habits get created. It just records your actions and stores it in your memory.\nIt\u2019s also the reason why we think that new skills are hard to learn: we don\u2019t make the right connections in our brains. We don\u2019t do the right actions that make the learning of a new skill easier.\nAs such, I really want to put emphasis on a word I used in my first sentence above: \u201cdeliberate\u201d.\nWhen you deliberately focus your efforts on doing the right actions to learn something new, you direct your brain to create the connections you want it to make.\nAnd that\u2019s powerful.\nThis article won\u2019t be focusing on any specific skill except for the skill of learning how to learn. The principles you will learn in this guide will apply to any skills you want to learn, from motor skills to intellectual skills.\nIt will also teach you the reason why it\u2019s so important to diversify your skill set, especially in this century.\nThis guide you\u2019re about to read is the culmination of the 100+ articles I have written on the subject, the learnings I\u2019ve made through my own experimentations, the books I\u2019ve read, the courses I\u2019ve completed, the data I\u2019ve collected from the SkillUp program, and the data I\u2019ve collected from various expert sources.\nIt\u2019s the ultimate guide to help you on your journey to skill development.\nAre you pumped?\nI know I am!\nHere\u2019s my favourite definition:\nSimple and to the point. But let\u2019s still dig deeper into it:\nIs writing a skill? You bet, but that\u2019s not a very practical skill to aim to learn.\nIt turns out, skills really are just a set of sub-skills. What is the skill of writing then? It is the combination of the following skills, and then some:\nA skilled writer will have proficiency in all of the above skills and more. In writing, and in as many other skills, it helps to have knowledge in other fields to actually have content to write about.\nThe above list holds the key to some learning to learn principles we\u2019ll talk about a little further below.\nBut do the exercise, if not now, then shortly after, of thinking of a skill and breaking it down into its smallest components. It\u2019s the kind of exercise that will teach you the habit of thinking smaller for your bigger thoughts, ultimately motivating you to achieve your ambitious goals. Refer to the section on building SkillUp Trees to push that even further.\n*Refer to Appendix A at the end for examples of skills I have learned in 15\u201320 hours of practice.\nWhen I started my SkillUp method (learning 3 new skills every month, practicing for 30 minutes each every day), I had two reasons for wanting to learn new skills:\nThese are perfectly valid reasons and likely to be the most common ones.\nWhat I found through learning so many skills in such a short amount of time is that there are many more benefits I hadn\u2019t originally thought about. And the following results have been observed by Michael Simmons with his 5-hour rule, which isn\u2019t that different from the SkillUp method.\nThe following list is not necessarily in order; however, all these benefits are incredibly important.\nSurprisingly, I didn\u2019t expect this at all but it makes so much sense in retrospect. When you learn a diverse set of skills, you broaden your knowledge.\nNo longer can I just have deep conversations with software engineers (my main profession). I\u2019m now more relatable in many other areas. I\u2019ve made friends because I knew about eCommerce, video editing, photography, drawing/art, Spanish conversations, music composition, web development, and more.\nI used to be a shy & introverted guy who had a hard time fitting in when I was not around engineers or game developers.\nHow that has changed in the past 14 months!\nAfter all, when is making deeper personal and professional connections a bad thing?\nDon\u2019t we all want deeper connections?\nAnother surprising fact for me, which again completely makes sense in hindsight, is that the more you learn, the faster you learn. I\u2019ll go deeper into that in the next section as this is a key to learning how to learn.\nJust to give an easy example: isn\u2019t it true that once you know a romance language, it\u2019s easier to learn the others. Being a native French speaker, it\u2019s much easier for me to learn Spanish than it is for an English speaker, simply because it comes from the same root, Latin.\nDon\u2019t we all want to learn faster?\nA lot of the reasoning behind this fact is that when you consistently practice a skill, inevitably, you progress.\nAnd progress = win.\nThe more wins you get, the more dopamine your brain produces. Without going into details, dopamine is a key factor to life satisfaction. The more satisfied you are, the more motivated you are.\nBy practicing three skills every morning, on average, I get three wins right at the start of my day. Imagine how pumped I am to keep going!\nDon\u2019t we all want to be more motivated?\nAll the other writers and interviewers I meet over video comment on my high energy levels. It\u2019s simple, I\u2019m really passionate about this stuff!\nDon\u2019t you have more energy when you do things that you like doing?\nSkill development can be a lot of fun. I never thought I\u2019d ever love Salsa Dancing, but it turns out it just might be the most fun skill I\u2019ve ever practiced. Knowing that I have a class every morning gives me so much energy.\nAnd when I finish it each morning and think about the progression I have made since day one, I get pumped.\nIf you learn a skill out of necessity, don\u2019t neglect the fun aspect to it. If you can\u2019t find fun in the progress, think about what it can bring afterwards. Higher salary = more activities with the family. Doesn\u2019t that give you more energy to think about the benefits?\nDon\u2019t we all want to have more energy?\nI love this quote and can fully attest to its truth. I\u2019ve had so many more opportunities since I\u2019ve become a polymath. More choices have opened up and I can truly do the things I care most about.\nI now have the freedom to work from wherever, whenever.\nBut thriving isn\u2019t just about freedom. Thriving has a different meaning for each individual. It means having a good balance of health, wealth, love, and happiness.\nDon\u2019t we all want to thrive?\nNow that you know what a skill is, and why it matters to learn some, it\u2019s time to look at the most important part, and the core of this guide: how you too can learn skills?\nA lot of people think skill learning goes like this:\nor like this:\nThe first one is completely wrong. The second one is closer to reality and probably the most widely accepted, but it\u2019s also wrong. This is just a perception of our learning and is actually quite demoralizing, because the reality is more like this:\nYou\u2019ll reach what people call \u201cplateaus\u201d on a regular basis during your skill development process. Most people stop around that time, thinking that they\u2019ve reached their limit.\nThe truth is, limits are all in our heads. We can do so much more than we think we can. We see the limits pushed all the time in sports or athletics. Once someone beats a record, suddenly \u201ceveryone\u201d can reach that \u201climit\u201d, pushing it further than ever before.\nRemember, everyone thought the 4-minute mile was impossible, but Roger Bannister proved them wrong, and opened the door for 26 more people to do it soon after.\nLet\u2019s now dig deeper into the steps to learn new skills in under 20 hours:\nWhen you went to school when you were younger, you were fed with answers. You were told an exact way in which you should be learning a concept. Out of school, we don\u2019t think much on how we learn new things. We search for online videos and hope for the best.\nThis is NOT the best way to learn. Heck, it wasn\u2019t even the best way in school!\nThe best way to learn a new skill is to figure out how the skill can be learned from your previous set of skills. More on that in section #2. Build SkillUp Trees.\nBefore jumping on your next course and hope that you\u2019ll learn a skill from there, take time to craft a learning plan. Think about the following:\nDon\u2019t limit yourself to these questions. Think of other questions on your own. Personalize your learning based on your strengths and weaknesses. Be realistic and scale a skill down as needed.\nIn a previous article, I went into details about the SkillUp Tree principle. It\u2019s a powerful method to be more aware of what your current skillset is and how to move forward from there.\nTo learn any new skill in under 20 hours, you have to know what you\u2019re currently capable of and analyze what you should learn next. It\u2019s unrealistic to think that you can learn portrait photography in 15 hours if you\u2019ve never picked up a camera before.\nLet\u2019s use this very simple skill idea to illustrate the concept:\nFrom the Walking branch, we can branch further to the following branches:\nIt is impossible for you to learn the \u201cRunning\u201d skill if you don\u2019t know the \u201cWalking\u201d skill.\nOnce you\u2019re aware of what is required to learn a new skill and have a clear vision of how to learn it, it\u2019s time to put everything into practice. I can\u2019t stress the importance of consistency enough here. In learning anything, the more you practice, the easier it gets and the more connections your brain will make.\nExecute your plan from Step 1 for a week. Reflect on your learnings; what went right and what went wrong. Adjust as needed. Always measure how well your practice session went. As needed, use a tool like the SkillUp Journal to record and measure your progress.\nAdd some accountability to help you follow through. Share your progress with your entourage or online. Join like-minded groups of skill learners and compare progress. Remember, the first time you\u2019re going to do anything in life, you\u2019ll be bad at it, and that\u2019s normal. It\u2019s the people who pick themselves up after their \u201cfailures\u201d who learn best.\nAs needed, update your SkillUp Tree when progress has been made. It\u2019s incredibly rewarding to visually see how your learning has progressed.\nIn this section, we\u2019ll touch on Memory and how, as you might imagine, it plays a very important role in learning.\n1. Creating long term memories\nIt is common knowledge that we have two memory \u201csystems\u201d: the short term memory (or working memory) and the long term memory. Without going too scientific on you, the short term memories happen mostly in the pre-frontal lobe:\nAnd long-term memories are stored in the hippocampus:\n\u201cMemories\u201d always start as a short term memory, and in order to consider something acquired, it has to go from short term to long term memory.\nBut how do we make that happen? It turns out there are many ways, but here\u2019s an image that sums it up:\nTo simplify things: short term memories become long term memories by recollection. The more you expose your brain to a piece of information, the more complete the information will start to form in the hippocampus, where long term memories are stored.\nOnce information is stored in your long term memory, it can still change, but not as easily. More on that in section #7. Neuroplasticity.\nKnowing that, it\u2019s never a bad idea to \u201creactivate\u201d a memory \u201cfrequently\u201d. You\u2019ve probably seen that in action when doing a skill you haven\u2019t done for a while, like riding a bicycle, or playing a sport or an instrument.\nYou still remember the techniques, but you\u2019re a little \u201crusty\u201d. After a few minutes, it\u2019s as if you never stopped doing it.\nThat\u2019s what reactivation is all about.\nWhat happens then in your brain is it resends the \u201cnewly found\u201d information and sends it back to the long term memory to reinforce the knowledge. If you ride your bicycle the next day, you won\u2019t be \u201crusty\u201d again.\n2. Remembering Techniques\nRefer to the following table for seven powerful remembering techniques:\nResources:\n3. Note Taking\nHaving trouble remembering the techniques above?\nIt takes a lot of practice, but once you\u2019re good at them, you can greatly increase you ability to memorize things.\nAn easy technique, that everyone knows about, but not enough people apply is note taking when reading or watching videos. And by note taking, I don\u2019t mean highlighting. In fact, according to Dr. Barbara Oakley, highlighting can be detrimental to your learning.\nHave you noticed when you take notes of things to reference later, you tend to actually remember it without ever needing to reference it?\nWithout going too deep into the scientific details of why that is, you are making a conscious effort to recall it by writing it down. As mentioned above, it uses a few of your senses to create the memory.\nWant to greatly improve your memory in a short period of time?\nTake notes when you read and watch videos as it greatly improves your recollection by handwriting your notes.\n4. Recollection\nThis is the most important aspect of creating long term memories and something almost everyone does wrong.\nWhen and where should you revisit material you\u2019re trying to remember?\nWhere\nIt turns out that most of us don\u2019t do it the right way. Most people \u201cstudy\u201d material from the same exact environment; in the living room or in the study for example. The problem is that the brain stores the setting of the learning as a reference point to recall a memory.\nHave you noticed how, as a student, you had a hard time recalling information during an exam?\nOne of the possible causes of this is you only studied in one environment. Successful students often diversify their environments of study: in their bedroom, their living room, at a cafe\u0301 with other students, in the classroom, at the library, with music, without music, in a cold room, in a hot room, etc.\nThe more you vary your environment when trying to learn a new concept, the more deeper connections you\u2019ll make in your brain, creating stronger long term memories.\nIf you practice rock-climbing / bouldering at the same gym, at the same time with the same people, do you think you\u2019ll learn better than someone who varies the gym they go to, the people they go with, the indoor/outdoor settings, etc?\nNo, right?\nThe best athletes train for different scenarios. Same with the military. So whatever it is you are trying to learn, make it your mission to vary your study environment!\nWhen\nNow, let\u2019s attack the \u201cWhen\u201d.\nHave you ever revisited the same material over the course of a few days, hoping that it would \u201cstick\u201d, just to realize it doesn\u2019t get to your head?\nRight. Your brain doesn\u2019t work that way.\nHave you also noticed how when you study just before an exam, your recollection is pretty good, but a few days later, you\u2019ve basically forgotten everything you have \u201clearned\u201d?\nRight. Your brain doesn\u2019t work that way either.\nIn both scenarios, you\u2019ve learned nothing, or close to it.\nSo when should we practice recollection then?\nSpaced Repetition is what you\u2019re looking for. Here\u2019s an image that summarizes it really well:\nIf you have used language learning apps like Duolingo or Memrise, you may have noticed how they\u2019re doing that for you behind the scenes. It\u2019s no surprise then that these two apps have shown some of the best results for learning a new language.\nIf you\u2019re learning a new guitar chord today, recall it 24 hours later, then 7 days later, then a month later, then a year later. You\u2019ll \u201cforever\u201d remember it.\nIt works the same for every skill you want to learn. Never \u201cfire and forget\u201d. Put it in your calendar.\n5. Forgetting\nForgetting, it turns out, is one of the most important aspects to learning. There are at least two reasons why forgetting or unlearning is useful.\nFirst, during your learning phase of anything, you\u2019re unsure of the information you\u2019re digesting. You accumulate information without knowing how to make sense of it. This knowledge then becomes useless once you make the right connections. If you don\u2019t unlearn it, your brain will refer to it again and confuse what is \u201ctrue\u201d and what isn\u2019t.\nSecond, forgetting your experience is essential to being able to transfer skills from one job to another.\nIn summary, forgetting the context in which you learned something helps apply the learnings in a variety of other concepts.\n6. Sleep\nConnections made in your brain happen subconsciously, that is, when you\u2019re not actively practicing what you learn. While activities like jogging, meditating, and taking a shower help with the assimilation of information, sleeping is shown to provide even better results.\nIt is not a coincidence we\u2019re all familiar with the saying: \u201cLet me sleep on this.\u201d\nDuring sleep, our body rejects bad toxins accumulated and subconsciously \u201cwork on\u201d the material we have fed it before going to bed. If there\u2019s a concept you\u2019d really like to grasp but can\u2019t seem to during the day, try before going to bed. Chances are, you\u2019ll have a deeper understanding the next day.\nThat being said, during the day, if you\u2019re too tired to make sense of a problem you\u2019re trying to solve, power naps are a great way to achieve the results mentioned above.\nEinstein, Dali, Edison, and many others used this technique to get to their \u201cAha!\u201d moments.\nMoreover, a well-rested body and mind is more receptive to the different stimuli around, making easier to make sense of the information coming through your brain.\n7. Neuroplasticity\nNeuroplasticity is a way for your brain to fine-tune itself for efficiency.\nFor example, if someone suffers a brain injury, neuroplasticity allows the brain to \u2018rewire\u2019 itself in order to restore, or maximize brain functioning by rebuilding neural circuits and allowing an uninjured part of the brain to take over the damaged part.\nTo better understand neuroplasticity, refer to the following inforgraphics:\nOne of the biggest criticism I get about the SkillUp method is about mastery.\nI disagree that it\u2019s such a bad thing. It\u2019s also not necessarily true that a polymath is a master of none. A polymath, in fact, is a master of some.\nWhile it\u2019s true that with 15 hours of deliberate practice, you won\u2019t master anything (unless you\u2019re the greatest genius to ever live \u2014 and who will ever live).\nWhat some people fail to realize is that the SkillUp method is an ongoing process.\nRemember when I said that the more you learn, the faster you learn?\nAs we previously learned, it\u2019s true because of the mental chunks we create in our brains that allow us to make connections faster thanks to our growing collection of chunks.\nKnowing this, the more you learn, the faster it is to master something. Not-so-strangely enough then, learning to play the piano, the guitar, the violin and the tuba at the same time actually improves your mastery of each of those individually.\nGiven all these facts, over the period of a few years, you wouldn\u2019t be a master of none but rather a master of some. And that mastery of some is inevitably, based on science, going to be faster if you learn the skills concurrently as opposed to separately.\nThat was a great question I got from SkillUp member, Joshua Galinato.\nWhere is the balance between under-learning and over-learning?\nIn truth, it really depends on one\u2019s intention. If it\u2019s for a profession, then I\u2019d argue you should never stop learning and aim to go from good to great.\nWhen setting out to learn a new skill, be specific. Learn subsets of skills. Or subsets of subsets. Let\u2019s say mini-skills or bite-sized skills. The only way to know when to stop is to know what it means to have mastered or close-to-mastered the mini-skill.\nI personally aim for mini-skills and give myself about a month to be good in it, practicing 30 minutes a day. Basically, the core of The SkillUp method. But there\u2019s really no wrong answer here. If a mini-skill takes 5 hours, then so be it!\nWhile I rarely do direct follow-ups of the skills I have learned during the given month, I always end up using what I\u2019ve learned one way or another. When a few months later I want to learn a new skill that uses a previously learned mini-skill, my learning drastically accelerates.\nThe SkillUp method really has three different choices when it comes to the end of your 15 hours practice:\nYou can always improve anything you are doing. Take advantage of the momentum and accelerate your learning even more. Try to become a \u201cmaster\u201d at it.\nFor example, Erik Hamre always pushes to 100 hours and becomes really good at each skill he learns.\n2. Find a complementary skill; or\nTake advantage of the momentum to learn something complementary. Focus on a more specific subset of a particular skill, or a different branch. Learn a new language tense or vocabulary, learn new Photoshop techniques, learn new Machine Learning principles, etc.\n3. Do something else entirely.\nSome say that to find success, you must focus on a particular set of skills. I personally challenge this \u201crule\u201d. I like diversity. I like to be adaptable. I like to relate to other people\u2019s stories. I feel like I\u2019m a better person for it.\nDoing something else entirely breaks the momentum for that skill, but the success you acquired from learning previous skills should carry over and keep you motivated. Your brain will now accept that you can indeed learn things you never knew you could.\nCritical question!\nToo many people read articles or books, follow online course, watch YouTube videos, only to do nothing about it. Only 7% of people who start an online course finish it. That\u2019s a lot of missed opportunities.\nLet me do just a quick re-iteration why skill development matters:\nYou brain doesn\u2019t make the connections if you don\u2019t practice. I suggest you bookmark the guide and refer to it frequently. It\u2019s a lot to swallow on a single read and I don\u2019t expect you to remember it all right away!\nToday or this week, but no later, list the skills you\u2019d like to learn. Find resources on the subject. Create a model in your mind on what results you expect out of 15 hours of practice. Be realistic. Work backwards from your envisioned results. What are the baby steps required to get there? Refine and readjust as you go.\n*Refer to Appendix B for tons of resources on learning both important and coveted skills.\nFor complicated skills, I sometimes spend up to 8 hours planning it out. Remember the word \u201cdeliberate\u201d. Your planning won\u2019t be perfect but remember, it\u2019s all about experimenting to see what works best for you.\nAnother key to following through on anything you do in life is having accountability. Join groups of like-minded people that will help you on your journey.\nThere\u2019s really too much content here to make a short summary, but let me stress the following:\nWith a good system in place, learning new skills is not as hard as it seems. Learning varied skills will, in the near future, be the only way to thrive. People who start now will not only future-proof themselves, but also have the upper hand.\nSo what are you waiting for?\nIt\u2019s time to skill up your life!\nYou can do this!\nThanks for reading, sharing, and following! :)\nThe following is a list of some of the skills I\u2019ve learned in the past 14 months.

And I knew that if I wanted to teach, I had to get a college degree.\nI managed to get a college scholarship, but then things turned upside down. The first boy I ever dated swooped back into my life and said he wanted to marry me. So I did what any sensible, mature 19-year-old would do: I said yes and dropped out of college.\nI thought my dream of teaching was over. But then a friend told me about the University of Houston, a public four-year college about 40 minutes away. We were a young couple, watching every nickel. I figured I couldn\u2019t afford it.\nBut it turned out that tuition was just $50 a semester. This was a quality, public education \u2014 and I could afford it on a part-time waitressing salary. This time, I had the good sense to grab my chance at college with both hands. I got my degree and I got to live my dream: I became a teacher for students with special needs.\nHigher education opened a million doors for me. It\u2019s how the daughter of a janitor in a small town in Oklahoma got to become a teacher, a law school professor, a U.S. Senator, and eventually, a candidate for President of the United States.\nThe result is a huge student loan debt burden that\u2019s crushing millions of families and acting as an anchor on our economy. It\u2019s reducing home ownership rates. It\u2019s leading fewer people to start businesses. It\u2019s forcing students to drop out of school before getting a degree. It\u2019s a problem for all of us.\nWe got into this crisis because state governments and the federal government decided that instead of treating higher education like our public school system \u2014 free and accessible to all Americans \u2014 they\u2019d rather cut taxes for billionaires and giant corporations and offload the cost of higher education onto students and their families. The student debt crisis is the direct result of this failed experiment.\nIt\u2019s time to end that experiment, to clean up the mess it\u2019s caused, and to do better \u2014 better for people who want to go (or go back) to college, better for current students, better for graduates, better for their families, and better for our entire economy.\nThe first step in addressing this crisis is to deal head-on with the outstanding debt that is weighing down millions of families and should never have been required in the first place. That\u2019s why I\u2019m calling for something truly transformational \u2014 the cancellation of up to $50,000 in student loan debt for 42 million Americans.\nMy plan for broad student debt cancellation will:\nOnce we\u2019ve cleared out the debt that\u2019s holding down an entire generation of Americans, we must ensure that we never have another student debt crisis again. We can do that by recognizing that a public college education is like a public K-12 education \u2014 a basic public good that should be available to everyone with free tuition and zero debt at graduation. My plan for universal free college will:\nSome people will say we can\u2019t afford this plan. That\u2019s nonsense. The entire cost of my broad debt cancellation plan and universal free college is more than covered by my Ultra-Millionaire Tax \u2014 a 2% annual tax on the 75,000 families with $50 million or more in wealth. For decades, we\u2019ve allowed the wealthy to pay less while burying tens of millions of working Americans in education debt. It\u2019s time to make different choices.\nA Real Solution to the Student Debt Crisis: Broad Debt Cancellation\nThe enormous student debt burden weighing down our economy isn\u2019t the result of laziness or irresponsibility. It\u2019s the result of a government that has consistently put the interests of the wealthy and well-connected over the interests of working families.\nPolicymakers stood by as state after state pulled back on investments in public higher education and sent tuition soaring. They stood by as for-profit colleges exploded, luring in students with false promises and loading them up with debt as their executives and investors raked in billions in taxpayer dollars. They stood by as employers demanded higher credentials while offloading the cost of getting those credentials onto workers. And they stood by as corporations made huge profits off of the new skills graduates gained through higher education while giving workers almost nothing in the way of wage increases \u2014 increases policymakers falsely promised would make graduates\u2019 debt worth it.\nI\u2019ve been sounding the alarm on this crisis for years. The very first bill I introduced as a Senator was to provide relief to student borrowers. I fought to let people refinance their loans and lower their monthly payments. I successfully pushed the Department of Education to cancel the fraudulent loans of more than 80,000 students cheated by Corinthian Colleges. And when I learned that tens of thousands of Americans who had devoted their careers to public service might be denied the student loan relief they were promised, I made sure we got a new $700 million student loan forgiveness fund.\nBut despite these and other efforts, the student loan debt problem has continued to get worse. It\u2019s time for bold action to actually fix the debt crisis. Here\u2019s what my new plan would do:\nAn economic analysis from leading experts on student loan debt finds that my plan would provide at least some debt cancellation for 95% of people with student loan debt (and complete and total student debt cancellation for more than 75%), provide targeted cancellation for the families that need it most, substantially increase Black and Latinx wealth, and help close the racial wealth gap.\nPercentage of Borrowing Households Receiving Full Student Loan Cancellation\nThe experts also conclude that my plan will likely provide a boost to the economy through \u201cconsumer-driven economic stimulus, improved credit scores, greater home-buying rates and housing stability, higher college completion rates, and greater business formation.\u201d\nThe time for half-measures is over. My broad cancellation plan is a real solution to our student debt crisis. It helps millions of families and removes a weight that\u2019s holding back our economy.\nThat\u2019s step one.\nInvesting in Higher Education So Americans Can Graduate Debt-Free\nStep two is making sure nothing like this ever happens again. We need to fundamentally change the broken system that created the crisis in the first place.\nOur public schools for K-12 students are free for everyone. That\u2019s because we understand that a high school-level education is a basic need for our society and our economy \u2014 and it should be available to all.\nBut we expect everyone but the wealthy to take on mountains of debt if they want to get a post-secondary education. This is closing off opportunities for generations of Americans and widening this country\u2019s racial wealth gap. The cost of college deters people from attending college. And it forces people to drop out before completing their degrees. Only about two-thirds of students complete a four-year public college degree in six years and only about a third of students complete a two-year public college degree in six years. The financial strain of attending college \u2014 the need to work many hours to cover costs \u2014 is a top reason so many people drop out.\nCollege shouldn\u2019t just be a privilege for those who can afford to take on the significant expenses associated with higher education. Like K-12 education, college is a basic need that should be available for free to everyone who wants to go. That\u2019s why I\u2019m proposing a historic new federal investment in public higher education that will eliminate the cost of tuition and fees at every public two-year and four-year college in America. The federal government will partner with states to split the costs of tuition and fees and ensure that states maintain their current levels of funding on need-based financial aid and academic instruction.\nTo allow students to graduate debt-free \u2014 especially students from lower-income families \u2014 we must expand the funding available to cover non-tuition expenses. In addition to the existing federal higher education funding that can be redirected to cover non-tuition expenses, we should invest an additional $100 billion over the next ten years in Pell Grants \u2014 and expand who is eligible for a Grant \u2014 to make sure lower-income and middle-class students have a better chance of graduating without debt. Research shows that more funding for non-tuition costs helps improve graduation rates, which must be our goal.\nAddressing Inequities in Our Higher Education System\nIt\u2019s not enough to make sure every American can graduate from a public college debt-free. We also need to start fixing our higher education system so it better serves lower-income families and communities of color.\nFor decades, Black Americans were kept out of higher education by virtue of overtly discriminatory policies. Even as the civil rights movement rolled back racially discriminatory admissions policies, the stratification of our higher education system kept students of color concentrated in under-resourced institutions and left them vulnerable to predatory actors. Black and Latinx students are underrepresented in four-year public colleges and overrepresented in community colleges and for-profit colleges.\nNearly half of for-profit college undergraduate students are students of color. 95 percent of Black students attending a for-profit college took out student loans, and a staggering 75 percent of Black students who did not complete their program at a for-profit college defaulted. Many for-profit colleges have built a business model around sucking down taxpayer dollars while delivering a poor education primarily to students of color.\nAcross all colleges, Black students were on average nearly 20 percentage points more likely to need federal student loans. And because of factors like the size of these loans and discrimination in employment opportunities, Black students who finished a bachelor\u2019s degree on average owed more than their original student loan balance after 12 years.\nWe must do more to correct these historical injustices and to ensure that opportunities are fairly available to everyone. My plan will:\nAn Investment in Our Future\nExperts estimate my debt cancellation plan creates a one-time cost to the government of $640 billion. The Universal Free College program brings the total cost of the program to roughly $1.25 trillion over ten years.\nThe actual costs of these new ideas are likely to be even less than that. Experts find that my debt cancellation plan will create an economic stimulus, and study after study shows that investments in higher education provide huge returns for every dollar. But even setting aside the eventual returns to these investments, we can fully cover the cost of these ideas with revenue from my Ultra-Millionaire Tax on the wealthiest 75,000 families in the country \u2014 those with fortunes of $50 million or more.\n", "claps": "3.2K claps", "author": "Team Warren", "comments": [], "link": "https://medium.com/@teamwarren/im-calling-for-something-truly-transformational-universal-free-public-college-and-cancellation-of-a246cd0f910f"}, {"title": "21 Quotes That (If Applied) Change You Into a Better Person", "num_comments": 255, "tags": ["life", "life lessons", "mental health", "education", "self improvement"], "reading_time": 16, "text": "As long as man has been alive, he has been collecting little sayings about how to live. We find them carved in the rock of the Temple of Apollo and etched as graffiti on the walls of Pompeii. They appear in the plays of Shakespeare, the commonplace book of H. P. Lovecraft, the collected proverbs of Erasmus, and the ceiling beams of Montaigne\u2019s study. Today, they\u2019re recorded on iPhones and in Evernote.\nBut whatever generation is doing it, whether they\u2019re written by scribes in China or commoners in some European dungeon or simply passed along by a kindly grandfather, these little epigrams of life advice have taught essential lessons. How to respond to adversity. How to think about money. How to meditate on our mortality. How to have courage.\nAnd they pack all this in in so few words. \u201cWhat is an epigram?\u201d Coleridge asked, \u201cA dwarfish whole; Its body brevity, and wit its soul.\u201d Epigrams are what Churchill was doing when he said: \u201cTo improve is to change, so to be perfect is to have changed often.\u201d Or Balzac: \u201cAll happiness depends on courage and work.\u201d Ah yes, epigrams are often funny too. That\u2019s how we remember them. Napoleon: \u201cNever interrupt an enemy making a mistake.\u201d Franc\u0327ois de La Rochefoucauld: \u201cWe hardly find any persons of good sense save those who agree with us.\u201d Voltaire: \u201cA long dispute means that both parties are wrong.\u201d\nBelow are some wonderful epigrams that span some 21 centuries and 3 continents. Each one is worth remembering, having queued in your brain for one of life\u2019s crossroads or to drop at the perfect moment in conversation. Each will change and evolve with you as you evolve (Heraclitus: \u201cNo man steps in the same river twice\u201d) and yet each will remain strong and unyielding no matter how much you may one day try to wiggle out and away from them.\nFundamentally, each one will teach you how to be a better person. If you let them.\nAt the beginning of his life, few would have predicted that Theodore Roosevelt even had a choice in the matter. He was sickly and fragile, doted on by worried parents. Then, a conversation with his father sent him driven, almost maniacally in the other direction. \u201cI will make my body,\u201d he said, when told that he would not go far in this world with a brilliant mind in a frail body. What followed was a montage of boxing, hiking, horseback riding, hunting, fishing, swimming, boldly charging enemy fire, and then a grueling work pace as one of the most prolific and admired presidents in American history. Again, this epigram was prophetic for Roosevelt, because at only 54 years old, his body began to wear out. An assassination attempt left a bullet lodged in his body and it hastened his rheumatoid arthritis. On his famous \u201cRiver of Doubt\u201d expedition he developed a tropical fever and the toxins from an infection in his leg left him nearly dead. Back in America he contracted a severe throat infection and was later diagnosed with inflammatory rheumatism, which temporarily confined him to a wheelchair (saying famously, \u201cAll right! I can work that way too!\u201d) and then he died at age 60. But there is not a person on the planet who would say that he had not made a fair trade, that he had not worn his life well and not lived a full one in those 60 years.\nThere is the story of the alcoholic father with two sons. One follows in his father\u2019s footsteps and ends up struggling through life as a drunk, and the other becomes a successful, sober businessman. Each are asked: \u201cWhy are you the way you are?\u201d The answer for both is the same: \u201cWell, it\u2019s because my father was an alcoholic.\u201d The same event, the same childhood, two different outcomes. This is true for almost all situations \u2014 what happens to us is an objective reality, how we respond is a subjective choice. The Stoics \u2014 of which Epictetus was one \u2014 would say that we don\u2019t control what happens to us, all we control are our thoughts and reactions to what happens to us. Remember that: You\u2019re defined in this life not by your good luck or your bad luck, but your reaction to those strokes of fortune. Don\u2019t let anyone tell you different.\nThere is a proverb about revenge: Before setting out for a journey of revenge, dig two graves. Because revenge is so costly, because the pursuit of it often wears on the one who covets it. Marcus\u2019s advice is easier and truer: How much better it feels to let it go, to leave the wrongdoer to their wrongdoing. And from what we know, Marcus Aurelius lived this advice. When Avidius Cassius, one of his most trusted generals rebelled and declared himself emperor, Marcus did not seek vengeance. Instead, he saw this as an opportunity to teach the Roman people and the Roman Senate about how to deal with civil strife in a compassionate, forgiving way. Indeed, when assassins struck Cassius down, Marcus supposedly wept. This is very different than the idea of \u201cLiving well being the best revenge\u201d \u2014 it\u2019s not about showing someone up or rubbing your success in their face. It\u2019s that the person who wronged you is not happy, is not enjoying their life. Do not become like them. Reward yourself by being the opposite of them.\nLaura Ingalls Wilder, author of the classic series Little House, lived this, facing some of the toughest and unwelcoming elements on the planet: harsh and unyielding soil, Indian territory, Kansas prairies, and the humid backwoods of Florida. Not afraid, not jaded \u2014 because she saw it all as an adventure. Everywhere was a chance to do something new, to persevere with cheery pioneer spirit whatever fate befell her and her husband. That isn\u2019t to say she saw the world through delusional rose-colored glasses. Instead, she simply chose to see each situation for what it could be \u2014 accompanied by hard work and a little upbeat spirit. Others make the opposite choice. Remember: There is no good or bad without us, there is only perception. There is the event itself and the story we tell ourselves about what it means.\nIn the hiring process, most employers look at where someone went to school, what jobs they\u2019ve held in the past. This is because past success can be an indicator of future successes. But is it always? There are plenty of people who were successful because of luck. Maybe they got into Oxford or Harvard because of their parents. And what about a young person who hasn\u2019t had time to build a track record? Are they worthless? Of course not. This is why character is a far better measure of a man or woman. Not just for jobs, but for friendships, relationships, for everything. When you seek to advance your own position in life, character is the best lever \u2014 perhaps not in the short term, but certainly over the long term. And the same goes for the people you invite into your life.\nA man shows up for work at a company where he knows that management is doing something wrong, something unethical. How does he respond? Can he cash his checks in good conscience because he isn\u2019t the one running up the stock price, falsifying reports or lying to his co-workers? No. One cannot, as Budd Schulberg says in one of his novels, deal in filth without becoming the thing he touches. We should look up to a young man at Theranos as an example here. After discovering numerous problems at the health care startup, he was dismissed by his seniors and eventually contacted the authorities. Afterwards, not only was this young man repeatedly threatened, bullied, and attacked by Theranos, but his family had to consider selling their house to pay for the legal bills. His relationship with his grandfather \u2014 who sits on the Theranos board \u2014 is strained and perhaps irreparable. As Marcus Aurelius reminded himself, and us: \u201cJust that you do the right thing. The rest doesn\u2019t matter.\u201d It\u2019s an important reminder. Doing the right thing isn\u2019t free. Doing the right thing might even cost you everything.\nEveryone is better than you at something. This is a fact of life. Someone is better than you at making eye contact. Someone is better than you at quantum physics. Someone is better informed than you on geopolitics. Someone is better than you are at speaking kindly to someone they dislike. There are better gift-givers, name-rememberers, weight-lifters, temper-controllers, confidence-carriers, and friendship-makers. There is no one person who is the best at all these things, who doesn\u2019t have room to improve in one or more of them. So if you can find the humility to accept this about yourself, what you will realize is that the world is one giant classroom. Go about your day with an openness and a joy about this fact. Look at every interaction as an opportunity to learn from and of the people you meet. You will be amazed at how quickly you grow, how much better you get.\nIt is not your responsibility to fill up a stranger\u2019s gas tank, but when their car dies in front of you, blocking the road, it\u2019s still your problem isn\u2019t it? It is not your responsibility to negotiate peace treaties on behalf of your country, but when war breaks out and you\u2019re drafted to fight in it? Guess whose problem it is? Yours. Life is like this. It has a way of dropping things into our lap \u2014 the consequences of an employee\u2019s negligence, a spouse\u2019s momentary lapse of judgement, a freak weather event \u2014 that were in no way our fault but by nature of being in our lap, our f*cking problem. So what are you going to do? Complain? Are you going to litigate this in a blogpost or an argument with God? Or are you just going to get to work solving it the best you can? Life is defined by how you answer that question. Cheryl Strayed is right. This thing might not be your responsibility but it is your problem. So accept it, deal with it, kick its ass.\nIn Rome just as America, in the forum just as on Facebook, there was the temptation to replace action with argument. To philosophize instead of living philosophically. Today, in a society obsessed with content, outrage, and drama, it\u2019s even easier to get lost in the echo chamber of the debate of what\u2019s \u201cbetter.\u201d We can have endless discussions about what\u2019s right and wrong. What should we do in this hypothetical situation or that one? How can we encourage other people to be better? (We can even debate the meaning of the above line: \u201cWhat\u2019s a man? What\u2019s the definition of good? Why doesn\u2019t it mention women?\u201d) Of course, this is all a distraction. If you want to try to make the world a slightly better place, there\u2019s a lot you can do. But only one thing guarantees an impact. Step away from the argument. Dig yourself out of the rubble. Stop wasting time with how things should be, would be, could be. Be that thing. (Here\u2019s a cool poster of this quote).\nIn life, it\u2019s a fact that: You will be unappreciated. You will be sabotaged. You will experience surprising failures. Your expectations will not be met. You will lose. You will fail. How do you carry on then? How do you take pride in yourself and your work? John Wooden\u2019s advice to his players says it: Change the definition of success. \u201cSuccess is peace of mind, which is a direct result of self satisfaction in knowing you made the effort to do your best to become the best that you are capable of becoming.\u201d \u201cAmbition,\u201d Marcus Aurelius reminded himself, \u201cmeans tying your well-being to what other people say or do . . . Sanity means tying it to your own actions.\u201d Do your work. Do it well. Then \u201clet go and let God.\u201d That\u2019s all there needs to be. Recognition and rewards \u2014 those are just extra.\nA lot has been said of so-called \u201cF*ck You Money.\u201d The idea being that if one can earn enough, become rich and powerful enough, that suddenly no one can touch them and they can do whatever they want. What a mirage this is! How often the target seems to mysteriously move right as we approach it. It calls to mind the observation of David \u201cDHH\u201d Heinemeier Hansson who said that \u201cbeyond a specific amount, f*ck-you money can be a state of mind. One that you can acquire well in advance of the corresponding bank account. One that\u2019s founded mostly on a personal confidence that even if most of the material trappings went away, you\u2019d still be happier for standing your ground.\u201d The truth is being your own man, being self-contained, having fewer needs, and better, resilient skills that allow you to thrive in any and all situations. That is real wealth and freedom. That\u2019s what Emerson was talking about in his famous essay on self-reliance and it\u2019s what Epicurus meant too.\nIt was one of the great Stoics who said that if you live with a lame man, soon enough you will walk with a limp. My father told me something similar as a kid: \u201cYou become like your friends.\u201d It is true not just with social influences but informational ones too: If you are addicted to the chatter of the news, you will soon find yourself worried, resentful, and perpetually outraged. If you consume nothing but escapist entertainment, you will find the real world around you harder and harder to deal with. If all you do is watch the markets and obsess over every fluctuation, your worldview will become defined by money and gains and losses. But if you drink from deep, philosophical wisdom? If you have regularly in your mind role models of restraint, sobriety, courage, and honor? Well, you will start to become these things too. Tell me who you spend time with, Goethe said, and I will tell you who you are. Tell me what you pay attention to, Gasset was saying, and I can tell you the same thing. Remember that the next time you feel your finger itching to pull up your Facebook feed.\nYou can always get up after you fall, but remember, what has been said can never be unsaid. Especially cruel and hurtful things.\nLands can be reconquered, indeed in the course of a battle, a hill or a certain plain might trade hands several times. But missed opportunities? These can never be regained. Moments in time, in culture? They can never be re-made. One can never go back in time to prepare for what they should have prepared for, no one can ever get back critical seconds that were wasted out of fear or ego. Napoleon was brilliant at trading space for time: Sure, you can make these moves, provided you are giving me the time I need to drill my troops, or move them to where I want them to be. Yet in life, most of us are terrible at this. We trade an hour of our life here or afternoon there like it can be bought back with the few dollars we were paid for it. And it is only much much later, as they are on their deathbeds or when they are looking back on what might have been, that many people realize the awful truth of this quote. Don\u2019t do that. Embrace it now.\nThe problem with comparing yourself to other people is you really never know anyone else\u2019s situation. The co-worker with a nice car? It could be a dangerous and unsafe salvage with 100,000 miles. The friend who always seems to be traveling to far off places? They could be up to their eyeballs in credit card debt and about to get fired by their boss. Your neighbors\u2019 marriage which makes you so insecure about your own? It could be a nightmare, a complete lie. People do a very good job pretending at things, and their well-maintained fronts are often covers for incredible risk and irresponsibility. You never know, Warren Buffett was saying, until things get bad. If you\u2019re living the life you know to be right, if you are making good, solid decisions, don\u2019t be swayed by what others are doing \u2014 whether that is taking the form of irrational exuberance or panicked pessimism. See the high flying lives of others as a cautionary tale \u2014 like Icarus with his wings \u2014 and not as an inspiration or a source of insecurity. Keep doing what you\u2019re doing and don\u2019t be caught swimming naked! Because the tide will go out. Prepare for it! (Premeditatio Malorum)\nMarcus Aurelius would say something similar: \u201cBe tolerant with others and strict with yourself.\u201d Why? For starters because the only person you control is yourself. It\u2019s a complete waste of time to go around projecting strict standards on other people \u2014 ones they never agreed to follow in the first place \u2014 and then being aghast or feel wronged when they fall short. The other reason is you have no idea what other people are going or have been through. That person who seemed to rudely decline the invitation you so kindly offered? What if they were working hard to recommit themselves to their family and as much as they\u2019d like to have coffee with you, are doing their best to spend more time with their loved ones? The point is: You have no idea. So give people the benefit of the doubt. Look for good in them, assume good in them, and let that good inspire your own actions.\nAh, the way that a good one liner can humble even the world\u2019s greatest conqueror. Remember: we are all equals in death. It makes quick work of all of us, big and small. I carry a coin in my pocket to remember this: Memento Mori. What Juvenal reminds us is the same thing that Shakespeare spoke about in Hamlet:\nIt doesn\u2019t matter how famous you are, how powerful you are, how much you think you have left to do on this planet, the same thing happens to all of us, and it can happen when we least expect it. And then we will be wormfood and that\u2019s the end of it.\nWhile this is probably not a Churchill original (he most likely borrowed from Cardinal Newman: \u201cIn a higher world it is otherwise, but here below to live is to change, and to be perfect is to have changed often\u201d), Churchill certainly abided this in his life. He\u2019d even quip about his constant change of political affiliation: \u201cI said a lot of stupid things when I worked with the Conservative Party, and I left it because I did not want to go on saying stupid things.\u201d As Cicero would say when attacked that he was changing his opinion: \u201cIf something strikes me as probable, I say it; and that is how, unlike everyone else, I remain a free agent.\u201d There is nothing more impressive \u2014 intellectually or otherwise \u2014 than to change long held beliefs, opinions, and habits. The more you\u2019ve changed, the better you probably are.\nNot only here would Jesus call us on one of our worst tendencies but immediately also ask: \u201cAnd why do you look at the speck in your brother\u2019s eye, but do not consider the plank in your own eye?\u201d This line is similar to what the Stoic philosopher Seneca, who historical sources suggest was born the same year as Jesus, would say: \u201cYou look at the pimples of others when you yourselves are covered with a mass of sores.\u201d Waste no time judging and worrying about other people. You have plenty of problems to deal with in your own life. Chances are your own flaws are probably worse \u2014 and in any case, they are at least in your control. So do something about them.\nTolstoy puts the above words in the mouth of Field Marshall Mikhail Kutuzov in War and Peace. In real life, Kutuzov gave Napoleon a painful lesson in the truth of the epigram over a long winter in Russia in 1812. Tolstoy would also say, \u201cEverything comes in time to him who knows how to wait.\u201d When it comes to accomplishing anything significant, you are required to exhibit patience and fortitude, so much patience, as much as you\u2019d think you\u2019d need boldness and courage. In my book Conspiracy, about Peter Thiel\u2019s plot to destroy Gawker, his operative describes a similar idea: With enough time and patience, you can do anything.\nWill we wait for someone to save us, or will we listen to Marcus Aurelius\u2019s empowering call to \u201cget active in your own rescue \u2014 if you care for yourself at all \u2014 and do it while you can.\u201d\nBecause at some point, we must put articles like this one aside and take action. No one can blow our nose for us. Another blog post isn\u2019t the answer. The right choices and decisions are. Who knows how much time you have left, or what awaits us tomorrow? So get to it.\nI\u2019ve created a list of 15 books you\u2019ve never heard of that will alter your worldview and help you excel at your career.\nGet the secret book list here!\n**\nThis piece originally ran on Art of Manliness.\n", "claps": "74K claps", "author": "Ryan Holiday", "comments": [], "link": "https://medium.com/thrive-global/21-quotes-that-if-applied-change-boys-into-men-3e124aff36f8"}, {"title": "The rise of crypto in higher education \u2013 The Coinbase Blog", "num_comments": 80, "tags": ["blockchain", "technology", "coinbase", "education", "cryptocurrency"], "reading_time": 9, "text": "Coinbase regularly engages with students and universities across the country as part of recruiting efforts. We partnered with Qriously to ask students directly about their thoughts on crypto and blockchain \u2014 and in this report, we outline findings on the growing roster of crypto and blockchain courses amid a steady rise in student interest.\nWhen David Yermack, the finance department chair at New York University Stern School of Business, first offered his course on blockchain and financial services in 2014, 35 students signed up, eight fewer than the school\u2019s typical elective.\nBy spring 2018, the number of enrolled students climbed to 230, forcing Stern to move the class to its largest auditorium. This academic year, Yermack will teach the blockchain course both semesters to meet interest from students.\nYermack says he first developed the class because he was interested in bitcoin and how quickly interest in the cryptocurrency was growing. But other reasons soon emerged, notably demand from companies for people who understood cryptocurrency-related issues. Now, he sees his class as a way to give students the skills they\u2019ll need for jobs in the future.\n\u201cA process is well underway that will lead to the migration of most financial data to blockchain-based organizations,\u201d he says. \u201cStudents will benefit greatly by studying this area.\u201d\nSimilar scenes are playing out at top universities around the world. Students are flocking to classes on cryptocurrency and blockchain \u2014 the \u201cdistributed ledger\u201d technology that makes decentralized financial systems work \u2014 motivated in part by a hot job market for graduates with training in those fields.\nUniversities, in turn, are forming research centers and adding more crypto-related courses, in part to meet rising demand and also because they now see cryptocurrency as an area worthy of serious academic study.\nCoinbase reviewed course catalogs at the top 50 universities and found cryptocurrency classes across a variety of departments, including anthropology and finance \u2014 not only computer science.\nIn fact, the rise in offerings across disciplines maps to student interest: Students with a diverse set of majors say they\u2019d like to take cryptocurrency classes, according to a Coinbase survey conducted in partnership with Qriously. Nearly half of all social science majors expressed interest in taking a crypto class.\nOne possible reason for such diverse interest in blockchain is its potential to impact society across many domains. \u201cBlockchain combines theory and practice and can lead to fundamental breakthroughs in many research areas,\u201d says Dawn Song, a computer science professor at University of California, Berkeley. \u201cIt can have really profound and broad-scale impacts on society in many different industries.\u201d\nTo assess the current landscape of cryptocurrency in higher education, Coinbase analyzed the courses at the world\u2019s top 50 universities as ranked by U.S. News and World Report. Our study focused on classes available to undergraduate-level students in the fall 2018 semester or the most recent semester for which information was available online.\nThe analysis found that 42 percent of the top 50 universities offer at least one class on blockchain or cryptocurrency, and 22 percent offer more than one. Expanding the results to include longstanding foundational classes on cryptography, 70 percent of universities offer at least one crypto-related class.\nBlockchain and cryptocurrency courses are most prominent in the U.S. Only five of the 18 international universities on the list, or 27 percent, offer at least one class on blockchain or cryptocurrency. And only two \u2014 Swiss Federal Institute of Technology Zurich and National University of Singapore \u2014 offer more than one.\nJohns Hopkins University offers a business course on blockchain, where students learn about its security features and \u201cthe potential benefits and weaknesses of its fundamental structure as applied to businesses and organizations,\u201d according to the school\u2019s course catalog.\nAt Princeton, students can take an information-security class focused on secure computing systems, cryptocurrencies, blockchain, and related economics, ethics, and legal issues.\nCornell offers the highest number of classes when including cryptography, cryptocurrency, or blockchain. The 28 courses include \u201cAnthropology of Money\u201d and \u201cIntroduction to Blockchains, Cryptocurrencies, and Smart Contracts,\u201d which covers the cryptocurrency bitcoin and \u201cthe technological landscape it has inspired and catalyzed,\u201d according to the course description.\nMore than half of the universities analyzed offer at least one class on cryptography, the study of creating and solving coded messages and a key technical foundation for blockchain and cryptocurrencies.\n\u201cThe techniques used in blockchain aren\u2019t necessarily new,\u201d says Song, as it draws on areas such as cryptography, game theory, and distributed systems. These are areas \u201cwhere research and even education has been around for a really long time.\u201d\nStanford launched its Center for Blockchain Research this summer to bring together students and faculty from across the school\u2019s departments to work on various aspects of cryptocurrencies and blockchain.\nDan Boneh, a professor of computer science and electrical engineering at Stanford University and co-director of the center, said that every time he talks with a new team in the group he finds himself walking away with three new research ideas. \u201cThere are new technical questions being raised by blockchain projects that we would not work on otherwise,\u201d he says.\nOther leading universities that are known for strong engineering programs are adding courses and programs centered around blockchain, too. The University of Waterloo, Georgetown University, and the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign are among those expanding their research and course offerings.\nAt Berkeley, Song co-taught a course in the spring semester of 2018 on \u201cBlockchain, Cryptoeconomics, and the Future of Technology, Business and Law.\u201d It was a collaboration between the school\u2019s computer science, business, and law schools and admitted an equal number of students from each school.\nSong says the course was \u201chugely popular,\u201d noting that the instructors had to turn away more than 200 students because their classroom only had a 70-student capacity.\nThat interdepartmental approach may emerge as a hallmark of cryptocurrency and blockchain education, given the number of departments that are currently offering classes on the subject. Coinbase\u2019s analysis found that of the 172 classes listed by the top 50 universities, 15 percent were offered by business, economics, finance, and law departments, and four percent were in social science departments such as anthropology, history, and political science.\nHarvey says students recognize how in-demand this kind of knowledge is now. \u201cIf you\u2019re graduating from law school it\u2019s a tough market these days,\u201d Harvey says. \u201cHowever, the law students that are trained in blockchain, they don\u2019t need to apply anywhere. People are just asking them to join their firms.\u201d\nAmong students, interest in cryptocurrency and blockchain cuts across fields. In fact, more social science majors \u2014 47 percent \u2014 said they were interested in learning about cryptocurrency than computer science and engineering majors \u2014 34 percent \u2014 according to a survey of 675 U.S. students commissioned by Coinbase and conducted by Qriously.\nThe survey found that 17 percent of computer science and engineering majors have already taken a course that focuses on cryptocurrency and blockchain, as have 15 percent of economics and math majors and 11 percent of business majors. Just five percent of social science majors have taken such a course, the survey found.\nAmong all students surveyed, 17 percent said they consider their knowledge of cryptocurrency and blockchain very good, compared to just nine percent of the general population surveyed at the same time. Similarly, 18 percent of students said they own (or have owned) cryptocurrency, twice the rate of the general population.\nA quarter of all students said they would definitely or probably take a course focused on cryptocurrency or blockchain.\n\u201cThere\u2019s tremendous excitement\u201d among students right now, says Benedikt Bu\u0308nz, a doctoral student at Stanford focusing on cryptocurrencies.\nBu\u0308nz was pursuing a master\u2019s degree in artificial intelligence when he took a cryptography class. That sparked his interest in cryptocurrencies, setting the direction for his doctoral degree.\nPeople often approach Bu\u0308nz asking if he\u2019d be able to recommend someone with knowledge of cryptocurrencies for a job, he says, but the high demand means all the candidates he knows already have positions secured.\nThese days, he says, \u201cif you\u2019re an expert in cryptocurrencies and cryptography you\u2019ll have a difficult time not finding a job.\u201d\nThere are also plenty of options for people not currently enrolled at a university to learn more about crypto. Online learning sites like Udemy, Coursera, edX, and Udacity offer hundreds of courses, including general lessons in foundational cryptography and more specialized classes on blockchain and cryptocurrency.\nThese classes draw on a range of experts, including professors from some of the top 50 global universities and practitioners in the field. For instance, Coinbase Chief Technology Officer Balaji S. Srinivasan is one of several industry experts featured as part of the Udacity nanondegree program called \u201cBecome a Blockchain Developer.\u201d The program has two three-month terms and is focused on \u201cmastering job-ready skills with a hands-on approach.\u201d\nAcademia isn\u2019t known for moving quickly. But professors say that the maturation of blockchain and cryptocurrency and their adoption by businesses and other groups over the last few years has made it clear that it\u2019s a field with the potential for wide-ranging impact. And that\u2019s causing universities to take it seriously. \u201cYou need to prepare your students for the future,\u201d Duke\u2019s Harvey says, and \u201cblockchain is not going away.\u201d\nA note on methodologyCoinbase analyzed the courses currently offered at the world\u2019s top 50 universities as ranked by U.S. News and World Report: Best Global Universities 2018. Our study focused on classes available to undergraduate-level students in the fall 2018 semester or the most recent semester for which information was available online. The research excluded classes that are graduate-level only. It left in classes that are open to undergraduate and graduate students or classes that were not clearly marked as graduate-level only. Results for the search term \u201ccrypto\u201d were excluded from the tallies and course descriptions listing if they were clearly unrelated to cryptocurrency or the foundational math principles underlying the technology.\nTo assess student sentiments about crypto, Coinbase also commissioned a study conducted by Qriously of 675 U.S. students ages 16 and older. The general population survey included 6,011 respondents over the age of 16.\n", "claps": "12.3K claps", "author": "Coinbase", "comments": [], "link": "https://blog.coinbase.com/the-rise-of-crypto-in-higher-education-81b648c2466f"}, {"title": "I Am Not Your Guru: How to Learn to Think For Yourself", "num_comments": "unspecified", "tags": [], "reading_time": 7, "text": "For as long as you\u2019ve been alive, people have been trying to tell you how to live.\nIt started when you were a baby.

Needless to say, I failed after so many attempts and wondered why.\nFrom that moment onward, I knew something had to be changed \u2014 my approach had to be change, my mindset had to be changed to accept others\u2019 opinion, literally everything.\nOnce I tried to understand the real business problem that I was trying to solve and the data that I had, I added some new features for better representation of the problem so that the model could learn the underlying pattern effectively.\nResults?\nI managed to improve the model\u2019s AUC (it was a classification problem) significantly compared to the little or no improvement using hyperparameter tuning.\nThis is how I learned the importance of feature engineering, the hard way. And I hope to share the importance of feature engineering and hyperparameter tuning with you.\nBy the end of this article, I hope you\u2019ll understand why feature engineering is more important than hyperparameter tuning and use this approach before going into the tuning part to solve your problems.\nLet\u2019s get started!\nI remembered when I first started learning data science stuff, feature engineering was not always the topic included in books and online courses.\nThis gave me a false impression that perhaps feature engineering is not that important in applying machine learning to solve problems.\nBefore talking about what feature engineering is and its importance. Let\u2019s take a step back and try to understand how machine learning models work.\nHow machine learning models work? Essentially, a machine learning model is just an algorithm that learns the \u201cpattern\u201d by being trained on the historical data to ultimately make prediction based on unseen testing data.\nIn other words, your model will not be able to learn the underlying \u201cpattern\u201d if the data isn\u2019t representative enough to describe the problem that you\u2019re trying to solve. And this is where the role of feature engineering comes into play.\nAlthough your model\u2019s performance depends on several factors \u2014 data and features prepared, model\u2019s used in training, problem statement, metrics to measure the model\u2019s success etc \u2014 great features still play a crucial part to determine the success of a model.\nWhat is the importance of feature engineering? In my opinion, although you can aggregate data to generate additional features (mean and max etc.), having a strong business domain knowledge will let you understand more about the data that you have and generate new features based on its relevance and relationship.\nWith great features, it gives more room when it comes to model\u2019s selection. You could choose a simpler model yet still be able to obtain good results as your data is now more representative and the less complex model can learn the underlying pattern easily.\nAt the end of the day, feature engineering boils down to problem representation. If your data has great features that represent the problem well, chances are your model will give better results as it has learned the pattern well.\nPersonally, I find this article well-written and extremely helpful to get you started in learning and using feature engineering \u2014 Discover Feature Engineering, How to Engineer Features and How to Get Good at It. Check it out and you\u2019ll know what I mean.\nHere I want to talk about the importance of hyperparameter tuning to give you an overall picture in comparison.\nA model hyperparameter is a configuration that is external to the model and whose value cannot be estimated from data. As a data scientist(or machine learning practitioner, whatever the name it is), model hyperparameters are unknown to us.\nWe can only find the optimum values based on the default values given, rules of thumb, or trial and error by searching around the discrete space of hyperparameters.\nTo give you a clearer picture, some of the hyperparameters are the learning rate for training a neural network, C and sigma values for Support Vector Machine (SVM), or the k value in k-nearest neighbours (KNN).\nWhat is the importance of hyperparameter tuning? Hyperparameters are crucial as they control the overall behaviour of a machine learning model. The ultimate goal is to find an optimal combination of hyperparameters that minimizes a predefined loss function to give better results.\nFailure to do so would give sub-optimal results as the model didn\u2019t converge and minimize the loss function effectively.\nIt\u2019s like exploring a range of possibilities and trying to locate the best combination that gives you the best results. Some of the common techniques used to tune hyperparameters include Grid Search, Random Search, Bayesian Optimization and others.\nNow that we\u2019ve understood the importance of both feature engineering and hyperparameter tuning, let\u2019s dig deeper and see why the former is more important than the latter.\nThis isn\u2019t to say that hyperparameter tuning is not important but rather this is a matter of priority when we talk about improving a model\u2019s performance and the final results, especially in real life business scenarios (which I\u2019ll explain later).\nFirst. We have to understand that default values of hyperparameters in most machine learning libraries are sufficient to cater to most use cases. Typically it\u2019s hard to improve performance significantly. At Kaggle, hyperparameter tuning matters a lot. In real life, it hardly matters at all.\nSecond. Let\u2019s face it. Hyperparameter tuning is time-consuming and computationally expensive. It takes a lot of time to iterate different combination of hyperparameters to achieve a minor improvement. Even worse, each iteration requires heavy resources if you have a massive amount of data and complex model. In business context, time is money. And if the effort and time needed in the search for optimum hyperparameters don\u2019t justify the final ROI (Money!), chances are hyperparameter tuning is not needed at all if your model is good enough for deployment given a set of data with great features.\nThird and the last. It\u2019s extremely difficult to achieve both optimum features and hyperparameters in real life given time constraints. Therefore, to achieve great results with quantum leap of improvement at a shorter time period, a more intelligent choice is to first perform feature engineering to represent the problem well enough so that models can learn and predict accurately. Only after we have great features, then can we consider tuning hyperparameters if time allows or required by business context. This is the main reason why feature engineering should come first and hyperparameter tuning should come second.\nThank you for reading.\nBy sharing my mistakes and learning experience, I hope you\u2019ve understood the importance of both and why feature engineering should be the priority when it comes to improving your model\u2019s performance.\nIf you want to learn more about feature engineering and how to apply it to your machine learning problems, then this book is for you \u2014 Feature Engineering for Machine Learning. Feature engineering is not a formal topic in typical machine learning courses, and hence this book is meant to give you practical application with exercises throughout the book with several feature-engineering techniques.\nHope that helps!\nAs always, if you have any questions or comments feel free to leave your feedback below or you can always reach me on LinkedIn.

Our generation does not like definitions, we do not like to be restrained, you were not my boyfriend. We were not dating.\nWe were not dating, we were friends, just friends, my guy, so it meant you did not have to return my phone calls and you did anyway, so that meant I was special. We were post-modern friends engaging in post-mortem love, except you\u2019d think dystopian love would be more impactful because it\u2019s all you get in a world full of poisoned water and dying bees. You\u2019d think nihilist millennial love would make you dig your fingers in and hold on because you cannot know when anything will be gone. We cannot even afford to be alive, you\u2019d think we would know how precious it is to intertwine fingers and fall asleep feeling wanted. You\u2019d think we would learn to want the last good things left.\nMaybe that\u2019s the problem. We don\u2019t trust that anything is real anymore.\nWe were not dating, and you woke me up night after night for months at a time, crawling into my bed and telling me you missed the way my hair smelled, you loved me, you loved me, you loved me.\nWe were not dating, and you pressed your forehead against mine and told me you had loved me since you met me, you had loved me for a year. We were not dating, and I began leaving my ringer on when I went to bed at night, in case you called, because you usually did.\nWe were not dating, we just sat naked wrapped in each other at the window with the lights off smoking cigarettes, spilling our guts and our dreams in each other\u2019s laps again and again. We were not dating, and you pulled me into you, not one time, many times, saying, Get closer. We were not dating and you did not want to share me with other lovers but you could not ask for that because we were not dating. We were not dating and neither of us had other lovers.\nWe were not dating and we wept in each other\u2019s arms and you told me I was the moon. We were not dating and when I got scared of the fallout, you rushed to my house, you told me a part of you said, I am off the hook, and the rest of you said, You love that girl, something is wrong, go be with her.\nWe were not dating and my body never felt safer with any man before or after you, we were not dating but you looked into my eyes while you were cumming and told me I was holy, we were not dating and I told everyone we were trying on friendship again after Everything That Had Happened. We were not dating and you told me, After a year, I still long for your touch.\nWe were not dating so you didn\u2019t have to show up if you didn\u2019t want to, we were not dating, so you didn\u2019t have to say why or when you\u2019d be back. We were not dating and we discussed politics and feminism in bed and I wrote poems about fucking you and we talked about the misogyny of the Cool Girl Trope, and then I was the Cool Girl for you. We were not dating and I could have done it like this forever, but every time you stopped showing up I was afraid to call, because when you needed space it meant you needed to pretend I was no longer a person you knew, and this was okay because we were not dating. We were not dating and I could only be cool when it felt like this love wasn\u2019t going anywhere. We were not dating and if I could just be cool, then you wouldn\u2019t tell stories later about how I was crazy.\nWe were not dating and you blamed me when people thought we were, and you also told me you didn\u2019t want to be anyone\u2019s secret. We were not dating and you wanted to make sure everyone knew we were not dating, but you also wanted them to know we were fucking when it suited you. We were not dating and we had long conversations about how we always ended up coming back to each other\u2019s arms, and we did so while holding each other close in my bed, wrapped in my blankets. We were not dating and we said things to each other like, I want to wake up with your skin against my skin. We were not dating but we loved each other so it didn\u2019t matter.\nWe were not dating and I started getting real high at night to offset the suddenness of your absence, to try and stop myself from waking up at 3 am expecting you. We were not dating and I missed you but I was only allowed to miss you at times when you missed me back because missing you at the wrong times meant I was clingy.\nWe were not dating and you left books and items of clothing and liquor at my house, so much that I am still drinking your whiskey even now.\nWe were not dating and my dog stopped barking at the sound of you climbing the stairs. We were not dating and you took my scarf and wore it all winter. We were not dating and each time you returned you told me what I meant to you, how you would be kinder to me this time.\nWe were not dating so I have nothing to call you by now, it is as though you were never here, except you were. You put your hands everywhere and everything you touched is now rotting and half-collapsed. We were not dating and I got used to you being here, so wanting you here was my fault and my problem. We were not dating so none of this has to be on you. We were not dating and I am crazy.\nWe were not dating and you are not my ex, you are a year\u2019s worth of poems. A collection of things you left in my apartment, now packed in a Rubbermaid bin at the back of my closet that I cannot bear to part with. The reason the smell of American Spirits and whiskey combined makes me comforted and wet at the same time, and I wonder if, in your home, there is still a trail of bobby pins telling my story. I bet they are there, stuck in the carpet and on the bathroom sink, amid all the clutter. We were not dating and you never threw anything away but people. We were not dating, we were never dating, there was nothing to throw away, nothing to dismiss, nothing to sever.

Everywhere we look, we\u2019re encouraged to accept attachment (or infatuation or enmeshment) as love \u2014 but it\u2019s not.\nWanting (or \u201cneeding\u201d) constant reassurance is not love. Jealousy is not love. Poor boundaries is not love. Fear is not love.\nCalling your partner your \u201ceverything\u201d is not love.\nEven if we \u201cgive it right back\u201d in an argument or chalk it up as \u201cpassion.\u201d\nLove does not hurt. That is all ego and fear, and in the moment we do this to another person, we are never operating from a position of love.\nWhen I broke up with my boyfriend of five years, his immediate reply was:\nAs though that was an appropriate response.\nAs though his interests were the most important topic of conversation in that instant. As though what he wanted would somehow cancel out what I wanted, or make me forget my own dissatisfaction. As though that was an appropriate, loving response.\nThe appropriate, loving response is something more like, \u201cwhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d i.e., \u201cWhat do you want that you\u2019re not getting?\u201d Because only one of us wasn\u2019t getting our wants met and, given that he wasn\u2019t the one doing the dumping, it was clearly me, not him.\nThe dude was pretty successful at his job, and after we broke up he said, \u201cI can persuade anyone \u2014 except you.\u201d\nI stared at him. And then I said, \u201cwell, I bet you don\u2019t try to persuade anyone by talking about what you want.\u201d\nI\u2019d bet exactly zero of his multi-million dollar deals were won by him whining shit like, \u201cbut I really want this commission check!\u201d\nAnd yet he wanted this to somehow be okay with me.\nNow, to be clear, we should want to be with our partner, and we should absolutely tell them! But there\u2019s a time and place to do so, and it isn\u2019t when it comes off as running over what they want \u2014 especially if they aren\u2019t getting it.\nIn the words of Dale Carnegie,\nAnd don\u2019t just talk that way \u2014 think and love that way, too. If you want them to stick around, don\u2019t isolate your interests and dismiss theirs.\nAfter my boyfriend argued \u201cbut I want to be with you!\u201d, I sighed and asked, \u201cwhy do you want to be with me?\u201d\nAnd he looked me in the eye and actually said,\nFull stop.\nAnd that\u2019s how he both broke my heart and finalized my decision in about 1 second flat.\nEmma Lindsay addressed this best in her essay Fish Love, saying:\nSo many women are ready and willing to accept \u201cbeautiful\u201d as the highest compliment; embrace it as the pinnacle of their person. But it\u2019s not.\nThat comment really says nothing about you.\nWe romanticize this culturally, but we\u2019re wrong.\nIf someone cares that you\u2019re beautiful but doesn\u2019t care about your feelings or reality, they do not love you.\nThe same goes for anything superficial \u2014 money, status, etc.\nEvery time I break up with a boyfriend, I break my mother\u2019s heart a little too.\nShe\u2019ll say she \u201cjust wants me to be with someone\u201d and that that\u2019s a normal thing to want \u2014 for ourselves, and our daughters.\nWe\u2019re quick to chalk this up as \u201clove,\u201d but it isn\u2019t when it directly usurps the other person\u2019s own decisions.\nThe real reason my mother wants this is not for my benefit, but hers. Because the woman just can\u2019t deal with change.\nShe wants everything in a box and wants it to stay there, regardless of her own daughter\u2019s happiness being a part of it.\nShe thinks I owe her my partner\u2019s permanence. When I break up with them, she piles more emotion onto my breakup than I do, clinging to my exes, staying in touch with them (sometimes for years), as though to tell me: \u201cyou made a mistake.\u201d Even if it wasn\u2019t what I wanted.\nMy mother also hates it when I change jobs. She hated when I dropped my startup\u2014 because she just \u201cliked telling people\u201d I had my own business. (Never mind it wasn\u2019t what I wanted.)\nAnd here\u2019s our recurring conversation on the topic of me marrying my current partner:\nWe think this sort of shit is okay \u2014 endearing even; \u201cmotherly\u201d \u2014 simply because \u201call moms\u201d think and act this way. And maybe that\u2019s true. But that doesn\u2019t make it okay, and it sure as hell doesn\u2019t make it love.\nI care for her, but I tolerate this mostly because I choose to honor my social obligation to. In the words of Shakespeare:\n\u2014 Cordelia, King Lear\nBut how we fail to see that this \u201cmotherly\u201d behavior is far from \u201clove\u201d astounds me.\nWhen I asked one boyfriend why he loved me, he said,\nWhich is grammatically interesting. Because he didn\u2019t say he liked that we agreed with each other on everything, or shared viewpoints, but rather that I was merely a flesh-and-blood mirror in which he saw his favorite things bounced back to him.\nWhen people like partners who are what they\u2019re not, to make their own favorite features stand out in contrast.\nMen who base their identity on conventional masculinity, and only feel secure in their masculinity (and thus their own skin) with \u201ctiny\u201d or \u201cmotherly\u201d or otherwise hyper-\u201cfeminine\u201d women. Women who base their identity on conventional femininity, and only feel secure in their femininity (and thus their own skin) with \u201cbig\u201d or \u201cfatherly\u201d or otherwise hyper-\u201cmasculine\u201d men.\nBeing attracted to characteristics that you don\u2019t uphold is always rooted in insecurity, not love.\nWe are complete people on our own \u2014 our partners are not the \u201cother half,\u201d and it is not the job of the opposite sex to bring a set of characteristics to the table.\nWhatever you are attracted to or think you want or need in a partner is actually what you should first provide for yourself.\nLove is not addition, it\u2019s multiplication.\nWhen you put two half-people together, with both expecting the other to fill in the gaps and \u201ccomplete\u201d them, you don\u2019t get 1/2 + 1/2 = 1. You get 1/2 x 1/2... 1/4.\nOn the contrary, when you put two healthy, whole people together, with each operating with emotional self-sufficiency, you get 1 x 1... still 1. An entire unit, complete whether in \u201cparts\u201d and as a whole.\nThere\u2019s a huge difference between generosity and martyrdom, and the fact that so many of us struggle to discern the difference is alarming.\nGenuine love requires you to first love and serve yourself and your needs.\nOften people interpret this as \u201cselfishness,\u201d and it\u2019s a sad disservice that we\u2019ve done to ourselves by confusing the two.\nSelfish people are not self-loving. (On the contrary, they are overcompensating for their lack of self-love.)\nWe do not win love by frantically scrambling to deny our needs and meet someone else\u2019s \u2014 even if we hope that we\u2019ll get ours met if they only do the same back.\nSometimes we forget that other people do not belong to us. We are not entitled to them.\nSo often we want to mark them as our own, especially with some legal binding to make things more like \u201cforever.\u201d (Because God forbid they continue to roam the earth as an individual, with no legal obligation not to stray. God forbid we love them as their own person without a sense of ownership or agency over them.)\nSometimes our primary goal is to \u201cget married,\u201d and a person is simply the means.\nOr we see a person as the object of our desire, and then see marriage as the vehicle through which to get that shit on lock down.\nBecause it is NOT feeling\nIt is deliberate. We have agency in who and how we love, and we are not at the mercy of how the wind blows. Love takes work.\nLove is not anxious, but secure.\nGood love has nothing to do with what they are or what we harvest from them.\nGood love is the way in which we love them \u2014 it\u2019s us loving their very being, us loving their essence, us loving their ups and downs and imperfections and dumb complaints and irritations and short-comings and differences and decisions \u2014 each day.\n", "claps": "30K claps", "author": "Kris Gage", "comments": [], "link": "https://psiloveyou.xyz/most-of-what-we-think-of-as-love-is-bullshit-5443bb524b92"}, {"title": "There Is A Superpower Within Us All \u2013 Mind Cafe \u2013 Medium", "num_comments": 24, "tags": ["personal development", "life", "life lessons", "love", "self improvement"], "reading_time": 5, "text": "Ted Strollo was an Italian immigrant and master wood carver who came to California for a better life. He had few possessions, no family and no job.\nHe built a little cabin in the woods above the town of Los Gatos. He drank acorn coffee. He was a kind man and a master woodworker. Out of a single piece of wood he created an amazing sculpture with perfect cylindrical balls in the middle. He called the piece his \u201cmystery tree of life.\u201d\nTed Strollo\u2019s life was quiet and solitary, until the day he was struck by a vehicle and hurled twenty feet through the air.\nMy father, an administrative law judge, was driving home from work when he witnessed the accident. He pulled over and rendered aid. He followed the ambulance to the hospital and spoke to the police and doctors.\nMy father learned that the victim was an Italian immigrant named Ted Strollo, and that he had no family. He discovered that Ted possessed no money for legal representation, so he decided to intervene and help.\nTed spent over a month in our home recuperating. He stayed in our guest room and my mother prepared his meals and did his laundry. When he recovered my father found him an affordable apartment and secured some state benefits.\nWe used to visit Ted on weekends. My father would buy him Stella Dora cookies and new socks. Dad once told me, \u201cJohnny, the elderly are often forgotten and overlooked. They have much to teach us if we\u2019re willing to take the time and listen.\u201d I never forgot that.\nBefore Ted Strollo passed away he gave my father his prized wooden sculpture, the \u201cmystery tree of life.\u201d We kept it in our family for many years before Dad donated it to an Italian cultural society.\nMy father lost his battle with dementia and renal complications in 2004. It had been a difficult couple of years for me. In many ways, the father became the son and the son became the father. I was so thankful I had the opportunity to be there for him.\nI shepherded my father through his medical odyssey and handled all the legal arrangements for my mother. We held a beautiful memorial, buried Dad and tried to return to our daily lives.\nI read once about something called, \u201cthe second death.\u201d When we die, our loved ones live on and remember us. They reminisce about the past and our lives together. They look at the old photographs.\nSometimes they pass down stories about us to their grandchildren. But eventually, we are forgotten. And that is our \u201csecond death. \u201d\nEach of us holds a superpower within us. Not the kind of superpower we see in Spiderman movies, but a real superpower that can be wielded by young and old alike.\nI watched my father use his superpower the day he helped Ted Strollo and brought him home to recuperate. My mother used her superpower too, cooking and caring for Ted.\nWhat is this mysterious superpower?\nEach of us has the power to improve the lives of others. Whether buying a homeless man a cup of coffee, nursing an Italian immigrant back to health, or helping your kids with their homework.\nPerhaps we will never know how our charitable actions help redirect a wayward soul. Maybe our kindnesses will be forgotten with subsequent generations as we approach our \u201csecond death.\u201d\nThat\u2019s okay. True heroes don\u2019t act for personal glory but for the greater good.\nWho knows how many acts of kindness my father set in motion by helping Ted Strollo? How many people did Ted Strollo positively touch in his remaining years?\nWe may never know, but kindness and charitable actions towards others produce a sort of grace in this world. Such actions make the world a better place. They elevate humanity.\nWe may forget the names of these angels on earth who selflessly help others, but through their kindnesses and charity, they make a difference.\nWhen we emulate them, we inch a bit closer to the divine. And that is a much greater thing than personal legacy.\nLearn to wield your superpower. It\u2019s easy to forget because life gets in the way. Still, your act of kindness today may help someone assist another tomorrow. A positive chain reaction will bloom, thus improving the lives of many down through the generations. It will enrich your soul, too.\nPeople who spread kindness and charity among others may never see the positive ripples, but they contribute to the best of us. Perhaps a piece of their spirit lives on in us.\nIn this way, we transcend our \u201csecond death\u201d and become part of the eternal dignity of mankind.

You fantasize long and hard enough, you can see anything in your future \u2014 like I could imagine moving to Switzerland to be a goat farmer.

Loving isn\u2019t \u201cimpressing.\u201d\nHealthy love doesn\u2019t involve fear of loss.

You win.\nBad: If you\u2019re unhappy and using your partner as an oasis, then you need to get your shit together.\nGood: you actually care about their wants and needs, and prioritize them in a way that doesn\u2019t tear you down\nBad: you compromise your own wants and needs, or base your value on your ability to \u201ckeep them happy.\u201d\nRad for them\nCongrats, there may be hope for you yet.\nGreat.

That doesn\u2019t mean we love them.\nYou don\u2019t feel love. You DO it. It\u2019s an act, not a feeling. It\u2019s a moment by moment decision and re-commitment. You know because it\u2019s deliberate and conscious.\nYou invest. You exert effort.\nYou don\u2019t knowingly do harm. You aren\u2019t vengeful, petty, manipulative, or jealous. Their needs never seem irritating. You aren\u2019t grabby with them, their time, or their affection in return. You are secure without demanding constant reassurance.\nYou prioritize their viewpoints. You learn their love language. You think in terms of their interests, not yours, and their needs are your own. You support them. You back them. You care and take care. You accept, and you allow.\nBecause everyone thinks they\u2019re in love when it\u2019s clear skies and calm waters, but watch them when the storm hits.\nYou know because you love even when you\u2019re pissed. It\u2019s love if you don\u2019t \u201cfight;\u201d you disagree.\nYou love if your objective is reaching an agreement, not picking a winner.\nYou love if you don\u2019t get defensive, insecure, or manipulative. If you don\u2019t keep score. If you don\u2019t hold grudges. If you don\u2019t \u201ctake back your love\u201d as punishment.\nYou love if you seek to understand before being understood; listen and honor what they share \u2014 and you don\u2019t double down with your own issues.

You can\u2019t get blood from a turnip and all that. Medium doesn\u2019t require you to subscribe to start earning.\nBut, if you can, you should subscribe to Medium ASAP.\nYou\u2019ll earn more money. Sure Medium doesn\u2019t require subscription for you to write on their platform. But some of your readers will be other writers.\nAnd those writers are sometimes hesitant to clap for people who don\u2019t have the green ring around their picture that indicates that they\u2019re subscribers. The thinking that I see in forums for Medium writers is that some people don\u2019t want to contribute pay to people who aren\u2019t contributing to them.\nI think that at least subconsciously, readers attach some cachet to the green circle that indicates that you\u2019re a Medium member. Even if all it really means is that you paid $5 a month \u2014 it signifies your seriousness, maybe.\nLast, and maybe most important, it\u2019s good karma to subscribe to Medium if you\u2019re writing here. You\u2019ll pay into the pool that pays everyone.\nThere are a bunch of Medium Writer groups on Facebook. It\u2019s a good idea to join at least one. This is especially helpful if you\u2019re a new writer and you\u2019re coming to Medium without any already established audience or writing community.\nYou\u2019ll be able to ask questions, connect with other writers, find people to bounce ideas off of. Many of the groups have daily link threads where you can post your work and get a few reads and claps. (You\u2019ll reciprocate by reading other people\u2019s work and clapping for it.)\nI belong to this group. And this one.\nThis is the same advice I have about writing fiction.\nIt\u2019s nice to workshop and have a group opinion sometimes. But there is so much value in developing a relationship with a single critique partner. Someone you trust, whose opinion makes your work better, and whose work you enjoy reading as well.\nIt makes a huge difference for me that I have a Medium friend that I touch bases with on Facebook every day. We talk about what we\u2019re working on, bounce ideas off each other, whine when things aren\u2019t going well, celebrate when they are.\nThose Medium Facebook groups are a good place to connect with people and hopefully find someone who will be a good fit as a critique partner.\nStarting your own publication on Medium is very easy.\nI highly recommend it.\nYou\u2019re reading this post in my own publication, The Write Brain. This publication is a place where I can gather all my posts about the business of writing, and where readers can come when that\u2019s what they want to read about.\nA publication functions similarly to a blog or a website. You can feature posts, add tabs to organize your posts. Best of all, readers can follow your publication and you can reach them via the \u2018letters\u2019 feature. Medium also lets readers know when publications they follow publish new posts.\nThe best thing about writing on Medium is that there\u2019s no editor telling you what you have to write.\nThe worst thing about writing on Medium is that there\u2019s no editor telling you what you have to write.\nThe freedom of being able to write whatever you want is glorious. But it also leaves you with the responsibility of choosing what exactly that\u2019s going to be. Without guidance.\nMy best advice is to sit down with your notebook and think about what it is you want to read. What do you want someone to write for you?\nI like to read about simple systems or ideas that actually work. I love when I read something that makes me think \u2014 yes! That makes sense. I like concrete, actionable ideas.\nI like to read snapshots of another person\u2019s experience \u2014 kind of like the literary version of peeking into someone\u2019s medicine cabinet when you use their bathroom. Posts like that make me feel grounded in the world and remind me that I\u2019m not alone.\nThose are the kinds of posts I do best writing.\nHere\u2019s something to try.\nMake a list of three words that describe how you feel when you read something you really connect with. Mine are: excited, engaged, enriched.\nKeep those words and your thoughts about the kind of stories you like to read in mind when you write. Because if that\u2019s how you want to feel, if that\u2019s the experience you want, you can bet there are readers out there who are just like you. They are your people.\nWhen I write about writing fiction, I often have a younger version of myself in mind.\nSometimes it\u2019s myself at twenty. Very young. Desperately wanting to be a writer, but not knowing how to even find the door in.\nRemember that scene from the movie Labyrinth, when Sarah couldn\u2019t find a way into the maze? It just goes on and on without any turns or doors or anything. Writing was like that for me when I was twenty.\nAnd just like Sarah, I didn\u2019t know the questions to ask. Sometimes the person advising me didn\u2019t know where I wanted to go and ended up giving me bad advice.\nAnd sometimes I write for myself at thirty-three. I\u2019d just finished writing my first novel. Now that I knew I could do it, I was burning with the desire to figure out how to do it well.

Yet, there\u2019s always something more you can do to engage with the platform and not only grind at your writing desk, if you know what I mean?\nLet\u2019s take a drive through some of the most popular writers and see what they do, maybe we can grow by imitation as well.\nI\u2019m thinking of people like Shannon Ashley, Tom Kuegler, umair haque \u2014 truly prolific and viral creators on Medium.\nBecause let\u2019s face it, the most popular writers on Medium become like influencers and learn to scale, monetize and grow their personal brand which is a craft in and of itself.\nWhile some advocate Instagram, if you are young and enjoy creating video, a YouTube channel may be an even better fit.\nSome topics and tags on Medium are golden since they get absurdly high ratios of reads to fans and claps to comments. In particular I\u2019d like to mention the writing and sexuality topics here are incredible.\nFor this reason there will always be a correlation between the top writer tag of writing with some of the highest earners on the Medium Partner Program.\nThe other topics and tags worth tackling are just really huge high-traffic ones, here you will see lower read ratios and comments, but higher engagement from external traffic (it\u2019s not clear how much Medium actually values this).\nMany of the most popular and successful writers on Medium have traditionally been high value and high volume writers. The more you write, the better you will get at it, it\u2019s only natural.\nYou will find your own tone, style guide and favorite topics. You will win fans who enjoy all of the above. It is a numbers game, so writing more may increase your chances of writing something more popular.\nNow listen carefully, to earn on Medium and grow your audience it\u2019s imperative to build up daily active followers (DAUs). In your stats page look at the total fans, and divide that number by 30. You want to consistently be beating your average each day.\nLet me give you an example:\nSo on average I have 5000 fans per the last 30 days, that\u2019s 167 followers a day. So in my stats Ill try to have days where I surpass my average. I want to keep growing this number. Whatever your baseline is, try to grow your audience and fans little by little.\nSo what do I mean by this? Medium stories are designed to be personal, vulnerable, authentic and personal narratives. The more spirited your stories, the more emotions and mirror neurons they will elicit in your audience.\nShannon and Tom both applied a \u2018rags to riches\u2019 narrative deeply embedded in their stories, that\u2019s relatable, like an underdog hero you want to support. You will notice they repeated this theme in dozens of their stories.\nHey, I too want to support an awkward kid or a single Mom to become like online legends. That is, there\u2019s an emotional theme where being their fans isn\u2019t just about their writing but about them as people. It becomes personal. It\u2019s memorable.\nUmair Haque is also memorable in his treatise on Capitalism or on what\u2019s wrong with American politics. There\u2019s enough material here for him to write daily about it. It\u2019s his thing. Like a muse that never dies.\nSo my question to you is what\u2019s your personal narrative and your thing?\nIt\u2019s almost universally accepted that having your work featured and in publications of note tends to increase engagement where you can build your following faster.\nThis includes especially Medium\u2019s own publications like OneZero, Elemental and Human Parts. (But don\u2019t be offended if they don\u2019t have time to reply to your submission).\nWriting on Medium isn\u2019t just a hobby of creativity, it\u2019s actually a personal branding boot camp. Don\u2019t imagine it\u2019s all about the quality of your writing. Doing these other things at the beginning can save you time and help you grow faster.\nIf you could give yourself advice when you first joined Medium knowing what you know now, what would you say or what advice would you give?

Who goes out there and says, \u201cYes, you\u2019ve made it, congrats,\u201d and then to the next person says, \u201cSorry, you haven\u2019t quite managed to get all the boxes checked. Better luck next time.\u201d\nIs there a laundry list of attributes? Some kind of yearly memo with the names of those recently accepted to \u201ctrue\u201d authorship?\nHow is one writer better than another? Is it amount of money earned (seems unfair), followers gained (a bit abstract), physical books published (not in this century, surely)?\nI\u2019ve been writing a blog since September 2018. Six months of writing, thousands and thousands of words, hours and hours of time. Yet I\u2019ve often struggled to consider myself a \u201creal\u201d writer.\nIf you asked me what a real writer looked like, I would probably think it was someone sitting at an antique oak desk, with the kinds of drawers that rattle and stick. Authentic.\nThe real writer\u2019s face would be illuminated from the sunlight coming in through the window they were facing. Possibly there would be a typewriter, or a sleek Macbook, or even just a leather-bound notebook with thick, curly script, obviously filled with authentic writer thoughts. Swirls of steam would rise up from the freshly brewed tea, playfully dancing in the morning sun.\nThe real writer would have an expression on their face I could never hope to emulate: a sort of laughing pensiveness. This is the face who has seen the underside of humanity, but finds it endearing. The real writer would contemplate the mysteries of life I\u2019m afraid to touch with a pole.\nAfter much cogitation and chin-stroking, the real writer would start writing about deep, important topics, quickly, smoothly and easily. The real writer doesn\u2019t ever have to cross out or use the backspace, because they never mess up. After two hours of blissful writing, they would stop, rise, stretch, and go for a quick ten-mile run, or possibly a session of mindful yoga, because they\u2019re aware of and on top of the stresses that a real writing life can bring.\nBy contrast, I\u2019m primarily not a writer. I scribble down thoughts in the margins of my own life, with frequent mistakes and a bit of swearing. Around my nine-to-five job, I try desperately to find and capture the time and inspiration I need to produce writing work. This work will never approach the quality of a real writer\u2019s work, of course, but it\u2019s important to get as close as possible.\nThe tea I drink is often stone cold, because I\u2019ve forgotten about it in my haste to find time to write. My desk faces a wall because our spare room/office is too small for it to face a window, and my computer\u2019s quite old. I eat junk food when I write, and I don\u2019t have time for runs.\nI sweat, I struggle, I suffer to create something that reads as though it was effortlessly produced whilst floating on a cloud of writerly inspiration. I write about memes, pop culture, psychology and cats. I\u2019m always trying to reach that Real Writer status, but painfully aware of the fact that I\u2019ll probably never quite get there.\nI think the only thing me and the Real Writer have in common is that we both like to drink tea.\nThis crystal-clear image in my head didn\u2019t come from nowhere. Somewhere down the line, after movies, sit coms, conversations and author bios, I condensed all my vague impressions of a Real Writer into that abstract being.\nI\u2019m not silly: I know that if I held the author of every written piece of work up to my Real Writer standard, the exalted circle would be pretty empty.\nSo what are the official rules? Who decides who is a real writer?\nIt seems like there are some authors who get excluded right off the bat. Bloggers, for example, catch a lot of flack for not having a \u201creal\u201d job.\nMommy bloggers especially bear the brunt of dubious inquisition, along with cooking blogs and travel blogs. Writing about traditional women\u2019s work can\u2019t possibly be classed as actual writing.\nRomance novels, Young Adult fiction, personal essays, all have on one occasion or another, fallen under the umbrella of \u201cnot real writing.\u201d\nWhat are the criteria? Again, I can\u2019t put my finger on what exactly lets people say this is real writing, and that isn\u2019t. Do you have to earn a paycheck to be a real writer? Does someone else have to employ you? Do you have to have at least nine hundred and ninety-nine fans?\nThis question has driven so much anxiety in me, up to the point that when people ask me how my blogging hobby is going, I willingly self-deprecate first, before they get a chance to tell me that writing about why I\u2019m sick of Game of Thrones memes, or why my cat made me late for work can\u2019t possibly be real writing.\nI\u2019m stopping that now.\nI\u2019m calling it. This is the rule, from now on. It doesn\u2019t matter if you write about hacky self-help tips or about the tragedy of the human condition. If you wrote words, any number of them, whether you thought they were good, whether or not you showed them to other people, you can call yourself a writer.\nWhat\u2019s the harm in letting anyone who wants to join the club? What do we gain from being exclusive? Who is standing at the gates, denying people the chance to fulfil their dreams? Let anyone who wants to be a writer become one, instantly, not by reaching deeply into the collective subconscious of a nation, or placing on the New York Times Bestseller list, but simply by writing. Anything.\nI won\u2019t let other people tell me I\u2019m not a real writer, and more importantly, I won\u2019t hold myself to the ridiculous and fake standard of what a Real Writer looks like, either. I may not be a \u201cReal\u201d writer, not now or possibly ever. It\u2019s likely I\u2019ll always do it on the side, that I won\u2019t always be paid for it, that I\u2019ll never publish a novel.\nAt the end of the day, I\u2019ve written words; ergo, I am a writer.\n", "claps": "763 claps", "author": "Zulie Rane", "comments": ["Amazing.

It takes some of the pressure off; you can apply casually or you can send your resume en masse and wait for a hiring manager to get in touch. But it\u2019s not always so simple. Anyone who has looked for a job before knows how hard it can be to get their resume in front of a set of human eyes.\nAnd worse: if your resume ever makes it past the applicant tracking system\u2019s filters and into the hands of a recruiter or a hiring manager, data suggests that they will spend an average of 6 seconds looking at it before deciding whether to keep it or toss it.\nYes \u2014 six seconds.\nA recent survey of over 3,000 job seekers found that 85% of them had gotten their current job through networking, not through blindly submitting resumes and hoping that someone would read them.\nResumes tell potential employers what you have done in the past, and allow them to speculate about what you could accomplish in the future. If you\u2019re lucky enough to put your resume directly into the hands of a recruiter or hiring manager, bypassing any screening systems, you have a unique opportunity to showcase your potential and to make a unique first impression.\nBut still \u2014 this is assuming you get your resume into the hands of an actual human being.\nIf you do, the traditional black-and-white Times New Roman resume is probably not going to wow anyone, especially if they just glance over it quickly. A bolder, more creative resume can, at the very least, catch someone\u2019s eye and encourage them to spend more than just a few seconds looking it over.\nEnter: the portfolio and the modern resume. Personal branding is not just for millennials, and it\u2019s not just for creatives. It\u2019s for everyone.\nHiring managers agree; a well-designed resume will stand out, even in fields that are not traditionally creative. The time and energy that you devote to styling your resume can help you make a solid first impression, as long as you don\u2019t \u201cact like a clown\u201d (their words, not mine).\nIt\u2019s worth noting that in certain circumstances, your resume will not be the way you get your foot in the door.\nResearch suggests that you\u2019re more likely to get your next job through your current connections; only 15% of openings are filled via job boards. This means that your personal brand is worth more than your resume spamming habit. Don\u2019t underestimate the power of making connections.\nRecruiters and hiring managers often find candidates on LinkedIn \u2014 via their profiles, not the job boards. Some companies even accept a LinkedIn profile in lieu of a resume. LinkedIn\u2019s one-click apply feature doesn\u2019t even require a resume.\nOther companies set up interviews with candidates based on their portfolios or other professional profiles, and only ask for a copy of their resume to keep on file, or to use during the interview as a \u201ccheat sheet\u201d.\nWhen it comes to the resumes of the future, candidates have two choices:\nHow did you get your last job?

I know a lot of y\u2019all probably saw the alluring pic and the attractive headline and thought, \u201cwell ... shit. This looks like some clickbait. But, like, really tho ... how do you create a brand in just the length of an NFL football game?\u201d\nI\u2019m glad you asked, comrade. We\u2019re about to dive deep \u2014 yet succinctly deep, as you\u2019re a busy marketing professional, or startup founder, or business consultant, and you don\u2019t have time to waste \u2014 into my other other other other job. The one with the corporate cubicle. The one who takes meetings with clients at coffeeshops. The one who funds the work of the existentialist Egalitarian empath you read here. My venture capitalist.\nSo, if you came here hoping for some of my trademark sarcastic armchair philosophy, your princess is in another castle \u2014 let me point you someplace else. 42,000 ft up:\nAlright, now that we\u2019ve got all the cool people cleared out, let me talk to you \u201cmarketers.\u201d First of all, there\u2019s a billion other posts out there like this. So, what makes mine credible?\nFirst: I\u2019m a 15-year marketing professional who\u2019s done lead gen, analytics, research, ops management, product management, project management, copywriting, brand strategy, brand advocacy, startup consulting, brand consulting, political branding, influencer marketing, and I\u2019m the CEO of my own business. I don\u2019t say that to brag. I don\u2019t even have a damned portfolio. My business is all referral, and I have a day job. On the side, I write essays on Medium. It\u2019s dope as hell. I live comfortably and get to travel a lot.\nSecond: It\u2019s clear. Concise. And it works. Efficient. Effective. Enthralling. You don\u2019t need much else in anything you offer your clients than those three words that start with E.\nAlso: really, critically, ask yourself this question: Does that Forbes Contributor really have all the answers? Or the content marketer at your local digital agency? Maybe. But here, we\u2019re going deep. I want to let you marinate on the particulars. I want to tell you a story about storytelling.\nThe other day, I met with a client on the roof of the Austin Public Library, on a beautiful Chamber of Commerce Sunday in the Live Music Capital of the World(TM). It was 1 p.m. She says to me, \u201cJohn, I just have all these things I want to do and no idea how to turn it into a business.\u201d That\u2019s when the alchemy started.\n\u201cListen. Three hours from now, you will have a business.\u201d That\u2019s what I told her. Then I went out and did the damn thing with her. In three hours. In three steps. What are those steps? Lawd ... glad you asked. This is what I call the DOW Method. Patent pending. Nah, fuck it. Just steal it. I don\u2019t need the money.\nSo the first question I asked my client was, \u201cwell ... what do you want to do?\u201d And then I just branched out from there. And I just let her talk. Where my interest was peaked, I just asked her to expand. I urged her to keep talking. Asked her questions to prompt her and excite her. Asked her uncomfortable questions. And just let her hit me with a Tsunami of facts, ideas, conditions, problems, challenges, strategies, opportunities, aspirations, goals, passions and so on.\nThe \u201cDownload\u201d is the first step. It\u2019s the one where you do the discovery. The fact-finding. The listening. Pay really close attention. Ask follow-up questions. And take copious amounts of notes. Sit across from your client with your laptop open. Clearly communicate what you are doing and why you are doing it. And let them open up to you. You\u2019ll find by the end of the hour, you have roughly 3\u20135 pages of single-spaced Google Doc text. The note-taking is crucial. You\u2019re going to want to refer to your notes in the next step.\nSo, in secret, I just made casual conversation with my client \u2014 sometimes about her business, sometimes not, sometimes asking even more followup questions \u2014 while taking the notes and placing them in a brand platform. Of course, you know what a brand platform is, and there are plenty of templates available. Here\u2019s the pieces I use:\nVision (the why): A one-sentence statement that clearly articulates the end-goal of the brand. These are their hopes and dreams. This is their Utopian near-future crystal ball. This is the problem statement ... flipped and reversed into something optimistic.\nMission (the what): What do we do? For whom? And how? Here\u2019s mine: \u201cI tell galvanizing brand stories for renegade organizations through unconventional means.\u201d That ain\u2019t actually it. But, now that I\u2019ve written it, I think it fits.\nValue Prop (benefits): These are the things that make what the brand offers good. Or great. Or spectacular. Think of it as how their own clientele will feel after they\u2019re done being serviced. Not a euphemism. Things like \u201cone-click on-demand service.\u201d Or, \u201cUnleash the strengths of each individual and the organization as a whole.\u201d Or, \u201cEnsures at least one orgasm every time we make love.\u201d\nPositioning (differentiators): These are what makes the brand stand out. What they offer that no one else does. Or the difference in how they offer it. Or the difference in why they offer it. 3\u20135 are fine. Things like \u201cwe\u2019re the only BDSM club in North Austin.\u201d Or, \u201cThe most transparent supply chain amongst all organic dragonfruit vendors in Southern California.\u201d\nProof Points (reasons to believe): These are the stats that provide the incontrovertible evidence that this brand is to be trusted. Either attesting to the validity of the problem to be solved, or to the validity of the solution the brand offers. 4 out of 5 dentists recommend. 27-time GRAMMY award winner. One out of every three statements is a lie. 5\u201310 are fine.\nKey Offerings (the how): These are the the actual products and/or services the brand provides, bucketed out with sub-text underneath. (Usually fits nicely in a three-up on a website or a PPT side.)\nKey Pillars: These are the 3\u20134 messaging buckets that focus on either the various things the brand stands for. Environmental activism, economic transformation and social justice, bucketed out with sub-text underneath.\nPersonality Traits (what are you like?): 6\u201310 adjectives that explain what the brand feels like. Happy. Murderous. Whimsical. Sexy. Ethereal. Timeless. Meta-cognitive. The more compelling the adjectives, the better.\nEssence (what do you value?): 4\u20138 nouns that are value statements. Things like transparency. Empathy. Pan-Africanism. Flavor.\nStory (about us): A couple paragraphs of backstory, personal story. The raison d\u2019etre.\nStrategy (how do you go to market?): This is a definition of the vehicles, merchandising, and project plan of taking whatever it is they do and turning it into something profitable. This is an overview of the tactics and why they\u2019re important.\nIf you\u2019ve taken thorough and compelling notes, all you need to do is slot those notes into where you think they belong. You\u2019ll naturally refine the messaging as you slot your notes into their proper spot on the hierarchy. Which will lead you right into ...\nIf you\u2019re more of a writer than a strategist \u2014 like me \u2014 this is your favorite part. This is the wizardry. This is the combination of the ingredients that hits all the proper flavor notes. The sweet, the spice, the sour, the salty, the savory. This is the seasoning.\nYou take all those refined notes you threw into those buckets and you turn them into liquid gold. Writing should be accessible, believable and consistent.\nOnce you\u2019ve finished putting your unique stamp on the souffle, then you can dig into the final two pieces of the brand.\nTagline: Simple, catchy phrase that grabs people\u2019s attention without lying to the general public. \u201cThe Ultimate Driving Machine.\u201d \u201cCome nappy, leave happy.\u201d \u201cJust because you did it doesn\u2019t mean you\u2019re guilty.\u201d Come up with 3\u20135 options for this.\nBrand Name: If someone tells you they\u2019ve come to you with a name ... change it. You don\u2019t come with a name first. I had a guy come to me with an idea of \u201cI want to start a food truck named \u2018Eat Out.\u2019\u201d And I was like, \u201cWhat kind of food y\u2019all serving?\u201d He says, \u201cVietnamese Soul Food fusion.\u201d I was like, \u201cNo. You want to start a truck called \u2018O Pho Sho.\u2019\u201d (NOTE: Truck did not actually go to market. I merely told that story to illustrate a point. The name should reflect the brand, rather than the brand reflecting the name.) 8\u201310 options are usually enough.\nNow. Will you be able to do all that within three hours? Probably not at first. You gotta get your Brandercise reps in. You\u2019ll probably have follow-up questions as you create in Steps 2 and 3. That\u2019s okay. Get them answered. I like to do my Organizing and Writing with my client right there with me, so I can keep them engaged and further refine our work. Also, because I\u2019m a massive extrovert. And, candidly, because I want them to hold me accountable.\nThe three-hour time limit, is, of course, totally arbitrary. I\u2019m not going to walk into Google and and re-brand them in three hours. But, for a startup just looking to get a start on their beginning? Yeah ... you can do it. Obviously, if you\u2019re finished after three hours and it\u2019s not where you want it \u2014 keep going. It\u2019s better to deliver quality than to deliver quickly.\nThe client looked at me through misty eyes, a wide smile, and said, \u201cHoly shit, John. You\u2019re a genius.\u201d I\u2019m not. It\u2019s mostly just the Adderall and the micro-dosing. But, she is going to market with the plan we put in place for her business. And she wouldn\u2019t be the first. Just the most recent. And I have numerous other clients on deck.\nI\u2019m telling you: if you can demonstrate that you\u2019re listening by asking good questions and taking good notes, and be intentional about how you structure and organize that information, and craft a devilishly clever and detailed narrative, you can tell just about any brand\u2019s story, keep your clients happy, and unlock truly breakthrough creative and strategic ideas that elevate brands, take ideas to market, and give hope to the masses.\n[***checks news***]\nWell ... maybe not that last part. We\u2019re all pretty fucked. Thankfully, the existentialist Egalitarian empath is on the case ... writing philosophical essays and progressive political platforms in the hope of driving real change fueled by kindness, wisdom, collaboration and intentional investment. Making the world suck less ... one word at a time.\nWell, shit. That\u2019s a tagline.

He\u2019s one of the best salespeople I know, but soon after starting, he emailed me to say he was struggling.\n\u201cI\u2019ve landed a few small accounts,\u201d Tim said. \u201cBut my pitch falls flat at big enterprises.\u201d\nAs I\u2019ve written before, I love helping teams craft the high-level strategic story that powers sales, marketing, fundraising \u2014 everything. So Tim and I met for lunch at the Amber India restaurant off San Francisco\u2019s Market Street to review his deck.\nAfter loading up on the all-you-can-eat buffet, I asked Tim, \u201cAt what point do prospects tune out?\u201d\n\u201cUsually a few slides in,\u201d he said.\nIntent on maximizing dining ROI, Tim went back to the buffet for seconds. When he returned, I pulled out my laptop and launched into a Powerpoint presentation.\n\u201cWhat\u2019s this?\u201d Tim asked.\n\u201cThis,\u201d I said, \u201cis the greatest sales deck I have ever seen.\u201d\nThe sales deck I showed Tim came from Zuora, the IPO-bound Silicon Valley company that sells a SaaS platform for subscription billing. If you pay for anything on a recurring basis (e.g. enterprise software), there\u2019s a good chance that Zuora facilitates those transactions.\nI had received the deck from an ex-Zuora salesperson, who said it helped him close the biggest deals of his career. (I have no connection to Zuora, and no relationship with anyone who currently works there. UPDATE: Some current Zuora employees have connected with me after reading this.)\nAbandoning his naan in a puddle of curried goat, Tim grabbed pen and paper and took notes as we ran through what made the Zuora deck so effective.\nSpecifically, we noted how brilliantly the deck led prospects through the following five elements, in precisely this order:\n(The ex-Zuora salesperson asked that I not share the Zuora deck publicly, and I will honor that request. However, I found slides on Zuora\u2019s website and SlideShare channel that exhibit nearly the same narrative flow; all of the images below come from those public sources.)\nDon\u2019t kick off a sales presentation by talking about your product, your headquarters locations, your investors, your clients, or anything about yourself.\nInstead, name the undeniable shift in the world that creates both (a) big stakes and (b) huge urgency for your prospect.\nThe first slide of virtually every Zuora deck \u2014 sales or otherwise \u2014 is some version of this:\nZuora came up with the phrase \u201csubscription economy\u201d to name the trend in which buyers increasingly choose recurring service payments over outright purchases. Zuora usually follows that with a slide laying out the history of the change:\nNote the subtle but important difference from what most pitch advice tells you, which is to start with \u201cthe problem.\u201d When you assert that your prospects have a problem, you put them on the defensive. They may be unaware of the problem, or uncomfortable admitting they suffer from it.\nBut when you highlight a shift in the world, you get prospects to open up about how that shift affects them, how it scares them, and where they see opportunities. Most importantly, you grab their attention. As Hollywood screenwriting guru Robert McKee says:\nAll prospects suffer from what economists call \u201closs aversion.\u201d That is, they tend to avoid a possible loss by sticking to the status quo, rather than risk a possible gain by opting for change.\nTo combat loss aversion, you must demonstrate how the change you cited above will create big winners and big losers. In other words, you have to show both of the following:\nZuora neatly accomplishes this by documenting a \u201cmass extinction\u201d among Fortune 500 companies...\n...and then showing how the \u201cwinners\u201d have shifted from product ownership to subscription services. Those include upstarts...\n...as well as rejuvenated incumbents:\nTo bring the point home, Zuora asks the following:\nOf course, by this point the common thread is already well established in prospects\u2019 minds: Winners adopt the subscription service models that Zuora supports.\nIt\u2019s tempting at this point to jump into the details of your product or service. Resist that urge.\nIf you introduce product/service details too soon, prospects won\u2019t yet have enough context for why those details are important, and they\u2019ll tune out.\nInstead, first present a \u201cteaser\u201d vision of the happily-ever-after that your product/service will help the prospect achieve\u2014what I call the Promised Land.\nYour Promised Land should be both desirable (obviously) and difficult for the prospect to achieve without outside help. Otherwise, why does your company exist?\nAfter demonstrating that the subscription economy will result in winners and losers, Zuora presents this Promised Land slide, which offers concrete criteria for what it means to win in the subscription economy:\nNote that the Promised Land is a new future state, not your product or service.\n(Over lunch, I asked my friend Tim to articulate his Promised Land, and he said, \u201cYou\u2019ll have the most innovative platform for ____.\u201d Nope: the Promised Land is not having your technology, but what life is like thanks to having your technology.)\nYour Promised Land is also crucial for helping prospects pitch your solution to colleagues after your sales meeting ends. In your absence, those colleagues will ask, \u201cWhat do those guys do again?\u201d Armed with a compelling Promised Land, your prospects are more likely to supply an answer that gets others on board.\nIf it\u2019s not clear by now, successful sales decks follow the same narrative structure as epic films and fairy tales. Your prospect is Luke, and you\u2019re Obi Wan, furnishing a lightsaber to help him defeat the Empire. Your prospect is Frodo, and you\u2019re Gandalf, wielding wizardry to help him destroy the ring. Your prospect is Cinderella, and you\u2019re the fairy godmother, casting spells to get her to the ball.\nWhen you introduce your product or service, do so by positioning its capabilities like the lightsaber, wizardry and spells\u2014as \u201cmagic gifts\u201d for helping your main character (prospect) reach that much-desired Promised Land.\nFor example, above is the slide where Zuora talks about the structure of its customer record. Out of context, this detail would likely bore even the most technical prospect.\nPositioned in the context of transitioning from an \u201cold world\u201d to a \u201cnew world,\u201d however, it\u2019s the foundation for an engaging conversation with prospects\u2014technical and otherwise\u2014about why it\u2019s so hard to reach the Promised Land with traditional solutions.\nIn telling the sales narrative this way, you\u2019re making a commitment to prospects: If they go with you, you\u2019ll get them to the Promised Land.\nBut the road to the Promised Land is, by definition, littered with obstacles, so prospects are rightly skeptical of your ability to deliver. The last piece of the pitch, then, is the best evidence you can offer that you can make the story you\u2019re telling come true.\nBy far, the most effective type of evidence is a success story about how you\u2019ve already helped someone else (who is similar to the prospect) reach the Promised Land. Zuora has a set of customer success stories that sales reps draw on, and while they\u2019re more elaborate in the actual deck, this testimonial captures the essence:\nI also like this one, from an exec at NCR (a Zuora customer), which speaks more explicitly to Zuora\u2019s stated Promised Land:\nWhat if you don\u2019t yet have a huge number of successful customers? Product demos are the next most effective evidence, but again, features should always be presented in the context of how they help a prospect reach the Promised Land.\nOf course, successful sales rarely happen solely as the result of a great deck. In order for salespeople to be successful, the entire organization must align around the narrative about change, Promised Land, and Magic Gifts.\nThere\u2019s no better example of that than Zuora. If you ever see a Zuora executive speak\u2014including CEO Tien Tzuo\u2014you\u2019ll almost certainly hear about the subscription economy and the winners and losers it\u2019s creating. In fact, that\u2019s the theme of virtually all the company\u2019s marketing communications and campaigns, as well as its public vision statement:\nAccording to the ex-Zuora salesperson, this company-wide alignment around the story made him wildly successful:\nJust three weeks after our lunch, Tim called to say he was seeing promising changes in how prospects at large enterprises were reacting to his new deck, which we drafted together based on Zuora\u2019s template. For one thing, prospects opened up much faster about the challenges they were facing. Also, he said the new pitch was more effective at engaging CFOs and other senior gatekeepers.\nThen, a week after that, Tim emailed with even better news: He had just signed the largest deal in his company\u2019s history.\nNext week, we\u2019re headed back to Amber India to celebrate.\nAbout Andy Raskin:I help leaders align around a strategic story \u2014 to power sales, marketing, fundraising, product, and recruiting.

In her eyes, the device strapped to her wrist was an invitation to be judged \u2014 an announcement to the world that she was paying attention to her health, which, in turn, called more attention to every single unhealthy thing she did.\n\u201cHonestly, I hated wearing it and the fact that people could see it,\u201d she says. \u201cI ended up feeling shamed by this little piece of plastic.\u201d Soon enough, that piece of plastic became a constant source of anxiety.\nSince the first Bluetooth headset sold in 2000, the wearable tech industry has been hard at work inserting itself into our daily lives. And by all accounts, it\u2019s working: The number of connected wearable devices worldwide is expected to jump to 1.1 billion or more by 2022, and some experts predict that fitness trackers will generate more than $3 billion in global revenue by that same year.\nBut for many people, donning a health-focused device each day isn\u2019t necessarily a good thing. Research suggests that even if you don\u2019t ditch your tracker after the first few months, it can be difficult to develop a healthy, effective relationship with the device that\u2019s monitoring your calories, steps, and minutes of sleep. In one study, published in the Journal of the American Medical Association, overweight participants who wore fitness trackers each day lost less weight than those who didn\u2019t. In another, people who wore them for a full year were no healthier than they\u2019d been at the start of the study. On the other end of the spectrum, users can become too obsessed with the data their devices are collecting, leading them to self-diagnose problems that don\u2019t exist; they can get so invested in their stats that it drains any enjoyment from previously pleasant activities; and, in some cases, fitness trackers can even exacerbate disordered eating behaviors.\nGranted, the communal element of fitness tracking can sometimes be a powerful accountability tool, providing the support and motivation people need to develop better health habits. Psychologist Stacey Rosenfeld, owner of Gatewell Therapy Center in Miami, Florida, says she\u2019s seen patients have positive experiences with apps designed to help them cut down on alcohol or stop smoking, for example. \u201cThe issue is not necessarily just the app,\u201d she says. \u201cIt\u2019s the combination of the app and the person who\u2019s using it.\u201d\nIf you\u2019re a person with obsessive tendencies, Rosenfeld advises setting firm boundaries for yourself, like tracking your calories only while actively exercising or checking your data for just a small window of time each day.\nFor Roetman, switching devices was enough. She still tracks her steps with an Apple Watch but feels more at ease with a device that\u2019s not fitness-specific. She also makes sure to keep her steps private: \u201cIt feels a lot less invasive,\u201d she says, \u201cwithout feeling like I\u2019m walking around with a \u2018judge me because I obviously care\u2019 sign taped to my wrist.\u201d\nIf you tend to get swept up in competition, it can also help to avoid any digital challenges or real-life settings that pit you against other users. Emily Cox, a 29-year-old physical therapist assistant in Atlanta, Georgia, stopped using workout-tracking apps last fall after recognizing that she was becoming obsessive about exercise. Those feelings came rushing back when she found herself in an interval training class that doled out heart rate monitors so attendees could monitor\u2014and broadcast\u2014how they were doing. \u201cWhen there are screens displaying everyone\u2019s statistics throughout the class, it basically singles out people who \u2018aren\u2019t working as hard,\u2019\u201d she says. \u201cEveryone has different fitness levels, goals, and abilities, and it makes you feel either inferior or like you didn\u2019t do very well if you\u2019re not in the top of the class.\u201d\nSometimes, though, those challenges might feel unavoidable. When Andrea D., a 29-year-old nonprofit manager (who preferred that her last name be withheld to protect the privacy of her former co-workers), was working at her job in Manhattan, her office held a competition to see which team could take the most steps during a certain period. (These competitions are so ubiquitous that Office Depot has its own guide to running one at your company.) Members of the winning department would receive bonuses, which Andrea was excited about, but things quickly turned toxic.\n\u201cI have a clear memory of being shamed by my male supervisor for not walking up 13 flights of stairs in heels and a suit,\u201d Andrea says. Others with low step counts had their chairs stolen or were forced to pace during meetings, she says. \u201cThe nursing mother in my department went to HR when [co-workers] said she had to pace while pumping in the closet they provided, but HR said it was a voluntary project and they couldn\u2019t police it.\u201d\nWe\u2019ve arrived at an interesting point in wellness culture. Inspirational quotes on social media remind us to slow down, practice mindfulness, and take deep breaths; at the same time, we\u2019re being prompted to check in, track progress, and constantly respond to notifications. \u201cIt\u2019s a fine line,\u201d says Ramani Durvasula, PhD, a licensed clinical psychologist and professor of psychology at California State University, Los Angeles. Apps have turned movement and mindfulness into one more thing to do, she says. \u201cIn the long run, missing a few days of meditation may be better for your mental health than obsessive ideation.\u201d\nWhen you\u2019re caught up in your numbers, this can be a tough thing to fully absorb. But it helps to remember the limitations of what those numbers can reveal. \u201cTo live by data alone is to dismiss a huge part of what it means to be human,\u201d says Sharyn Saftler, a registered dietitian and owner of Living Is Simple, a health coaching practice in Redmond, Washington. \u201cMeals are more than just calories, exercise is more than just hitting the gym for a certain amount of minutes, and sleep is much more than going to sleep when you\u2019re tired and getting up when you\u2019re not.\u201d An overly narrow focus on metrics doesn\u2019t just suck the pleasure out of these activities\u2014it also removes any sense of balance, setting up a harsh binary in which you either succeed or fail.\nSaftler has seen countless clients with aches, pains, stress, and poor relationships with food or exercise and statistics that depict them as healthy. Tracking can be useful for some, she adds, but you don\u2019t want to become dependent on the data and lose the ability to listen to how your body is responding.\n\u201cWhether it\u2019s helpful or harmful depends on what we\u2019re measuring,\u201d Rosenfeld says, \u201cand how quickly, potentially, that behavior could become out of control.\u201d In the pursuit of well-being, hitting quantitative targets isn\u2019t the same thing as feeling healthy and happy. Ultimately, the latter is the more important goal.\n", "claps": "1.2K claps", "author": "Caroline Cox", "comments": [], "link": "https://elemental.medium.com/the-dark-side-of-fitness-tracking-9b218989bc47"}, {"title": "Do I Need a Fancy Toothbrush? \u2013 Elemental", "num_comments": 5, "tags": ["dental care", "dental", "health", "gum disease", "toothbrush"], "reading_time": 4, "text": "Oral health matters \u2014 maybe a lot more than most people realize.\nA recent study in the journal Science Advances found that the same bacteria that cause the gum disease periodontitis also turn up in the brains of people with Alzheimer\u2019s disease. The more of this gum disease bacteria a person has in their brain, the greater the amount of protein-related damage they tend to have. The same research team infected the mouths of mice with the periodontitis bacteria and found this led to an increase in Alzheimer\u2019s-related brain proteins \u2014 a finding that suggests gum disease may contribute to the development of Alzheimer\u2019s, at least in animal models.\nThis isn\u2019t the first study to link gum disease to a serious medical condition. Research has found that people with gum disease are up to three times more likely to have a heart attack or stroke than those with healthy mouths. Experts have hypothesized that gum disease bacteria may slip into the bloodstream and promote the kind of inflammation and immune system activation that leads to arterial blockages.\nIt\u2019s not clear yet whether gum infections actually cause or contribute to the development of these major diseases. But coupled with the appeal of maintaining a strong, full set of teeth and healthy gums, there\u2019s ample reason to take care of your mouth. And there\u2019s evidence that powered toothbrushes may help you do that better than old-school manual brushes.\nHaphazard brushing leads to the buildup of plaque \u2014 a bacteria-riddled film that hardens and eventually causes gum disease and cavities, says Christopher Deery, dean of the School of Clinical Dentistry at the University of Sheffield in the U.K. \u201cTo prevent gum disease and decay, brushing to remove plaque is vital,\u201d he says. And some of his research finds a powered toothbrush does a better job of this than a manual model.\nFor a 2014 Cochrane review, Deery and colleagues analyzed roughly 50 studies that compared powered and manual toothbrushes in terms of their ability to prevent plaque buildup and gingivitis, which is the first stage of gum disease. \u201cAt three months, powered brushes reduced plaque levels by 21% and gingivitis by 11% [compared to manual brushes],\u201d he says. \u201cThis suggests that in the long term there will be less gum disease and decay if you use a powered brush.\u201d\nWhat might explain an electric toothbrush\u2019s superior plaque-removing prowess? \u201cRotation oscillation,\u201d Deery says. \u201cA brush action in which the brush head rotates in one direction and then the other is the most effective.\u201d This specialized brushing action is hard to achieve with a manual model. Even among powered brushes, the ones that featured rotation oscillation movements outperformed other types \u2014 including pricey \u201cionic\u201d and \u201cultrasonic\u201d models, his study found.\nThat doesn\u2019t mean you need an electric toothbrush to get the job done. \u201cIf you brush your teeth carefully and correctly, you could get almost the same results [with a manual],\u201d says Stephen Bayne, a professor emeritus of dentistry at the University of Michigan. But most people aren\u2019t diligent when it comes to brushing. \u201cGenerally, we say that powered toothbrushes are consistently better than manual ones,\u201d Bayne says.\nIf you\u2019re confident in your brushing skills and committed to manual models, there\u2019s evidence that the configuration of your toothbrush\u2019s bristles also makes a difference. A 2012 review from the Netherlands found angled bristles significantly beat out both flat and \u201cmultilevel\u201d bristle arrangements when it comes to removing plaque. Also, \u201cnothing is a substitute for flossing as well,\u201d Bayne says.\nWhile it may be worth it to splurge on a fancy toothbrush, you can probably skimp when it comes to mouthwash. Unless your dentist has specifically told you to use a rinse to treat dry mouth or another oral health condition, there\u2019s not a lot of high-quality evidence showing that mouthwash does much good for people with healthy teeth and gums, says Matthew Messina, an assistant professor at the Ohio State University College of Dentistry. \u201cMouthwash is not a requirement for good oral hygiene,\u201d Messina says.\nThe big takeaway here is that there\u2019s no substitute for thorough and regular brushing. That means brushing twice a day \u2014 minimum \u2014 and ideally after every meal, Bayne says.\nYou may be able to get the job done with a manual brush. But the research suggests a powered brush with a head that rotates in one direction and then the other is best when it comes to removing plaque and preventing gum disease.\n", "claps": "1.7K claps", "author": "Markham Heid", "comments": [], "link": "https://elemental.medium.com/do-i-need-a-fancy-toothbrush-b6064ba0fa7f"}, {"title": "Can Unproven Health Rituals Help You Get Well? \u2013 Elemental", "num_comments": "unspecified", "tags": [], "reading_time": 4, "text": "In 2004, researchers at the University of Turin in Italy conducted a compelling though controversial study.

To make it simple, this tool is implemented to solve architectural problems in your projects.\nAs you may have noticed in my previous article, we created a simple program that displayed \u201cDocker is magic!\u201d when it was launched.\nUnfortunately, when you are a developer you rarely create a stand-alone program (a program that does not require any other services to run, such as a database).\nHowever, how do you know if you need Docker-Compose? It\u2019s very simple \u2014 if your application requires several services to run, you need this tool. For example, if you create a website that needs to connect to your database to authenticate users (here 2 services, website and database).\nDocker-compose offers you the possibility to launch all these services in a single command.\nDocker is used to manage an individual container (service) for your application.\nDocker-Compose is used to manage several containers at the same time for the same application. This tool offers the same features as Docker but allows you to have more complex applications.\nThis tool can become very powerful and allow you to deploy applications with complex architectures very quickly. I will give you a concrete case study that will prove that you need it.\nImagine, you are the proud creator of your web software.\nYour solution offers two websites. The first allows stores to create their online store in just a few clicks. The second is dedicated to customer support. These two sites interact with the same database.\nYou are beginning to be successful and your server is no longer sufficient. So, you decide to migrate your entire software to another machine.\nUnfortunately, you didn\u2019t use docker-compose. So you\u2019re going to have to migrate and reconfigure your services one after the other, hoping nothing has been forgotten.\nIf you had used a docker-compose, in only a few commands you would have deployed your entire architecture on your new server. All you have to do now is make a few configurations and load the backup of your database to finalize the migration.\nNow that you know what docker-compose is going to be used for, it\u2019s time to create your first client/server-side application!\nThe objective of this tutorial is to create a small website (server) in Python that will contain a sentence. This sentence must be retrieved by a program (client) in Python that will display the sentence.\nTo create your first client/server application, I invite you to create a folder on your computer. It must contain at root the following file and folders:\nNormally you should have this folder architecture:\nIn order to start with reminders of Docker\u2019s basics, we will start by creating the server.\n2a. Create files\nMove to your \u2018server\u2019 folder and create the following files:\nNormally you should have this folder architecture in the following path \u2018server/\u2019:\n2b. Edit the Python file\nYou can add the following code to the \u2018server.py\u2019 file:\nThis code will allow you to create a simple web server inside this folder. It will retrieve the content of the index.html file to share it on a web page.\n2c. Edit the Html file\nYou can add the following sentence to the \u2018index.html\u2019 file:\nThis file will be shared by the server when it is started and this sentence will be displayed.\n2d. Edit the Docker file\nHere we will create a basic Dockerfile that will be in charge of executing our Python file. We will use the official image created to execute Python.\nIn order to continue with reminders of Docker\u2019s basics, we will create the client.\n3a. Create files\nMove to your \u2018client\u2019 folder and create the following files:\nNormally you should have this folder architecture in the following path \u2018client/\u2019:\n3b. Edit the Python file\nYou can add the following code to the \u2018client.py\u2019 file:\nThis code will allow you to get the content of the server web page and to display it.\n3c. Edit the Docker file\nAs for the server, we will create a basic Dockerfile that will be in charge of executing our Python file.\nAs you may have noticed, we have created two different projects, the server, and the client, both with a Dockerfile.\nSo far nothing has changed from the basics you already know.\nNow we are going to edit the \u2018docker-compose.yml\u2019 at the root of the repository.\nOnce the docker-compose is set up, your client/server application need to be built. This step corresponds to the \u2018docker build\u2019 command but applied to the different services.\nYour docker-compose is built! Now it\u2019s time to start! This step corresponds to the \u2018docker run\u2019 command but applied to the different services.\nThere you go, that\u2019s it. You should normally see \u201cDocker-Compose is magic!\u201d displayed in your terminal.\nIf you want to retrieve the complete code to discover it more simply or to execute it, I have put it at your disposal on my Github.\nAs usual, I have prepared a list of orders that may be useful to you with docker-compose.\nThanks for reading! I regularly share articles on the Medium platform, you can check out my profile.\nI am really happy to share with you this new article.

But there are a lot of other methods provided by the console that can help you debug better.\nLet\u2019s get started.\nThe very basic use case is to log a string or a bunch of JavaScript objects. Quite simply,\nNow, imagine a scenario when you have a bunch of objects you need to log into the console.\nThe most intuitive way to log this is to just console.log(variable) one after the other. The problem is more apparent when we see how it shows up on the console.\nAs you can see, no variable names are visible. It gets extremely annoying when you have a bunch of these and you have to expand the little arrow on the left to see what exactly the name of the variable is. Enter computed property names. This allows us to basically club all the variables together in a single console.log({ foo, bar }); and the output is easily visible. This also reduces the number of console.log lines in our code.\nWe can take this a step further by putting all of these together in a table to make it more readable. Whenever you have objects with common properties or an array of objects use console.table() . Here we can use console.table({ foo, bar}) and the console shows:\nThis can be used when you want to group or nest relevant details together to be able to easily read the logs.\nThis can also be used when you have a few log statements within a function and you want to be able to clearly see the scope corresponding to each statement.\nFor example, if you\u2019re logging a user\u2019s details:\nYou can also use console.groupCollapsed() instead of console.group()if you want the groups to be collapsed by default. You would need to hit the descriptor button on the left to expand.\nDepending on the situation, to make sure your console is more readable you can add logs using console.warn() or console.error() . There\u2019s also console.info() which displays an \u2018i\u2019 icon in some browsers.\nThis can be taken a step further by adding custom styling. You can use a %c directive to add styling to any log statement. This can be used to differentiate between API calls, user events, etc by keeping a convention. Here\u2019s an example:\nYou can also change the font-size , font-style and other CSS things.\nconsole.trace() outputs a stack trace to the console and displays how the code ended up at a certain point. There are certain methods you\u2019d only like to call once, like deleting from a database. console.trace() can be used to make sure the code is behaving the way we want it to.\nAnother important thing when it comes to frontend development is that the code needs to be fast. console.time() allows timing of certain operations in the code for testing.\nHopefully, the article provided some information on various ways to use the console.

That\u2019s why I spent the last three years as a Design Ethicist at Google caring about how to design things in a way that defends a billion people\u2019s minds from getting hijacked.\nWhen using technology, we often focus optimistically on all the things it does for us. But I want to show you where it might do the opposite.\nWhere does technology exploit our minds\u2019 weaknesses?\nI learned to think this way when I was a magician. Magicians start by looking for blind spots, edges, vulnerabilities and limits of people\u2019s perception, so they can influence what people do without them even realizing it. Once you know how to push people\u2019s buttons, you can play them like a piano.\nAnd this is exactly what product designers do to your mind. They play your psychological vulnerabilities (consciously and unconsciously) against you in the race to grab your attention.\nI want to show you how they do it.\nWestern Culture is built around ideals of individual choice and freedom. Millions of us fiercely defend our right to make \u201cfree\u201d choices, while we ignore how those choices are manipulated upstream by menus we didn\u2019t choose in the first place.\nThis is exactly what magicians do. They give people the illusion of free choice while architecting the menu so that they win, no matter what you choose. I can\u2019t emphasize enough how deep this insight is.\nWhen people are given a menu of choices, they rarely ask:\nFor example, imagine you\u2019re out with friends on a Tuesday night and want to keep the conversation going. You open Yelp to find nearby recommendations and see a list of bars. The group turns into a huddle of faces staring down at their phones comparing bars. They scrutinize the photos of each, comparing cocktail drinks. Is this menu still relevant to the original desire of the group?\nIt\u2019s not that bars aren\u2019t a good choice, it\u2019s that Yelp substituted the group\u2019s original question (\u201cwhere can we go to keep talking?\u201d) with a different question (\u201cwhat\u2019s a bar with good photos of cocktails?\u201d) all by shaping the menu.\nMoreover, the group falls for the illusion that Yelp\u2019s menu represents a complete set of choices for where to go. While looking down at their phones, they don\u2019t see the park across the street with a band playing live music. They miss the pop-up gallery on the other side of the street serving crepes and coffee. Neither of those show up on Yelp\u2019s menu.\nThe more choices technology gives us in nearly every domain of our lives (information, events, places to go, friends, dating, jobs) \u2014 the more we assume that our phone is always the most empowering and useful menu to pick from. Is it?\nThe \u201cmost empowering\u201d menu is different than the menu that has the most choices. But when we blindly surrender to the menus we\u2019re given, it\u2019s easy to lose track of the difference:\nWhen we wake up in the morning and turn our phone over to see a list of notifications \u2014 it frames the experience of \u201cwaking up in the morning\u201d around a menu of \u201call the things I\u2019ve missed since yesterday.\u201d (for more examples, see Joe Edelman\u2019s Empowering Design talk)\nBy shaping the menus we pick from, technology hijacks the way we perceive our choices and replaces them with new ones. But the closer we pay attention to the options we\u2019re given, the more we\u2019ll notice when they don\u2019t actually align with our true needs.\nIf you\u2019re an app, how do you keep people hooked? Turn yourself into a slot machine.\nThe average person checks their phone 150 times a day. Why do we do this? Are we making 150 conscious choices?\nOne major reason why is the #1 psychological ingredient in slot machines: intermittent variable rewards.\nIf you want to maximize addictiveness, all tech designers need to do is link a user\u2019s action (like pulling a lever) with a variable reward. You pull a lever and immediately receive either an enticing reward (a match, a prize!) or nothing. Addictiveness is maximized when the rate of reward is most variable.\nDoes this effect really work on people? Yes. Slot machines make more money in the United States than baseball, movies, and theme parks combined. Relative to other kinds of gambling, people get \u2018problematically involved\u2019 with slot machines 3\u20134x faster according to NYU professor Natasha Dow Schull, author of Addiction by Design.\nBut here\u2019s the unfortunate truth \u2014 several billion people have a slot machine their pocket:\nApps and websites sprinkle intermittent variable rewards all over their products because it\u2019s good for business.\nBut in other cases, slot machines emerge by accident. For example, there is no malicious corporation behind all of email who consciously chose to make it a slot machine. No one profits when millions check their email and nothing\u2019s there. Neither did Apple and Google\u2019s designers want phones to work like slot machines. It emerged by accident.\nBut now companies like Apple and Google have a responsibility to reduce these effects by converting intermittent variable rewards into less addictive, more predictable ones with better design. For example, they could empower people to set predictable times during the day or week for when they want to check \u201cslot machine\u201d apps, and correspondingly adjust when new messages are delivered to align with those times.\nAnother way apps and websites hijack people\u2019s minds is by inducing a \u201c1% chance you could be missing something important.\u201d\nIf I convince you that I\u2019m a channel for important information, messages, friendships, or potential sexual opportunities \u2014 it will be hard for you to turn me off, unsubscribe, or remove your account \u2014 because (aha, I win) you might miss something important:\nBut if we zoom into that fear, we\u2019ll discover that it\u2019s unbounded: we\u2019ll always miss something important at any point when we stop using something.\nBut living moment to moment with the fear of missing something isn\u2019t how we\u2019re built to live.\nAnd it\u2019s amazing how quickly, once we let go of that fear, we wake up from the illusion. When we unplug for more than a day, unsubscribe from those notifications, or go to Camp Grounded \u2014 the concerns we thought we\u2019d have don\u2019t actually happen.\nWe don\u2019t miss what we don\u2019t see.\nThe thought, \u201cwhat if I miss something important?\u201d is generated in advance of unplugging, unsubscribing, or turning off \u2014 not after. Imagine if tech companies recognized that, and helped us proactively tune our relationships with friends and businesses in terms of what we define as \u201ctime well spent\u201d for our lives, instead of in terms of what we might miss.\nWe\u2019re all vulnerable to social approval. The need to belong, to be approved or appreciated by our peers is among the highest human motivations. But now our social approval is in the hands of tech companies.\nWhen I get tagged by my friend Marc, I imagine him making a conscious choice to tag me. But I don\u2019t see how a company like Facebook orchestrated his doing that in the first place.\nFacebook, Instagram or SnapChat can manipulate how often people get tagged in photos by automatically suggesting all the faces people should tag (e.g. by showing a box with a 1-click confirmation, \u201cTag Tristan in this photo?\u201d).\nSo when Marc tags me, he\u2019s actually responding to Facebook\u2019s suggestion, not making an independent choice. But through design choices like this, Facebook controls the multiplier for how often millions of people experience their social approval on the line.\nThe same happens when we change our main profile photo \u2014 Facebook knows that\u2019s a moment when we\u2019re vulnerable to social approval: \u201cwhat do my friends think of my new pic?\u201d Facebook can rank this higher in the news feed, so it sticks around for longer and more friends will like or comment on it. Each time they like or comment on it, we\u2019ll get pulled right back.\nEveryone innately responds to social approval, but some demographics (teenagers) are more vulnerable to it than others. That\u2019s why it\u2019s so important to recognize how powerful designers are when they exploit this vulnerability.\nWe are vulnerable to needing to reciprocate others\u2019 gestures. But as with Social Approval, tech companies now manipulate how often we experience it.\nIn some cases, it\u2019s by accident. Email, texting and messaging apps are social reciprocity factories. But in other cases, companies exploit this vulnerability on purpose.\nLinkedIn is the most obvious offender. LinkedIn wants as many people creating social obligations for each other as possible, because each time they reciprocate (by accepting a connection, responding to a message, or endorsing someone back for a skill) they have to come back to linkedin.com where they can get people to spend more time.\nLike Facebook, LinkedIn exploits an asymmetry in perception. When you receive an invitation from someone to connect, you imagine that person making a conscious choice to invite you, when in reality, they likely unconsciously responded to LinkedIn\u2019s list of suggested contacts. In other words, LinkedIn turns your unconscious impulses (to \u201cadd\u201d a person) into new social obligations that millions of people feel obligated to repay. All while they profit from the time people spend doing it.\nImagine millions of people getting interrupted like this throughout their day, running around like chickens with their heads cut off, reciprocating each other \u2014 all designed by companies who profit from it.\nWelcome to social media.\nImagine if technology companies had a responsibility to minimize social reciprocity. Or if there was an independent organization that represented the public\u2019s interests \u2014 an industry consortium or an FDA for tech \u2014 that monitored when technology companies abused these biases?\nAnother way to hijack people is to keep them consuming things, even when they aren\u2019t hungry anymore.\nHow? Easy. Take an experience that was bounded and finite, and turn it into a bottomless flow that keeps going.\nCornell professor Brian Wansink demonstrated this in his study showing you can trick people into keep eating soup by giving them a bottomless bowl that automatically refills as they eat. With bottomless bowls, people eat 73% more calories than those with normal bowls and underestimate how many calories they ate by 140 calories.\nTech companies exploit the same principle. News feeds are purposely designed to auto-refill with reasons to keep you scrolling, and purposely eliminate any reason for you to pause, reconsider or leave.\nIt\u2019s also why video and social media sites like Netflix, YouTube or Facebook autoplay the next video after a countdown instead of waiting for you to make a conscious choice (in case you won\u2019t). A huge portion of traffic on these websites is driven by autoplaying the next thing.\nTech companies often claim that \u201cwe\u2019re just making it easier for users to see the video they want to watch\u201d when they are actually serving their business interests. And you can\u2019t blame them, because increasing \u201ctime spent\u201d is the currency they compete for.\nInstead, imagine if technology companies empowered you to consciously bound your experience to align with what would be \u201ctime well spent\u201d for you. Not just bounding the quantity of time you spend, but the qualities of what would be \u201ctime well spent.\u201d\nCompanies know that messages that interrupt people immediately are more persuasive at getting people to respond than messages delivered asynchronously (like email or any deferred inbox).\nGiven the choice, Facebook Messenger (or WhatsApp, WeChat or SnapChat for that matter) would prefer to design their messaging system to interrupt recipients immediately (and show a chat box) instead of helping users respect each other\u2019s attention.\nIn other words, interruption is good for business.\nIt\u2019s also in their interest to heighten the feeling of urgency and social reciprocity. For example, Facebook automatically tells the sender when you \u201csaw\u201d their message, instead of letting you avoid disclosing whether you read it (\u201cnow that you know I\u2019ve seen the message, I feel even more obligated to respond.\u201d)\nBy contrast, Apple more respectfully lets users toggle \u201cRead Receipts\u201d on or off.\nThe problem is, maximizing interruptions in the name of business creates a tragedy of the commons, ruining global attention spans and causing billions of unnecessary interruptions each day. This is a huge problem we need to fix with shared design standards (potentially, as part of Time Well Spent).\nAnother way apps hijack you is by taking your reasons for visiting the app (to perform a task) and make them inseparable from the app\u2019s business reasons (maximizing how much we consume once we\u2019re there).\nFor example, in the physical world of grocery stores, the #1 and #2 most popular reasons to visit are pharmacy refills and buying milk. But grocery stores want to maximize how much people buy, so they put the pharmacy and the milk at the back of the store.\nIn other words, they make the thing customers want (milk, pharmacy) inseparable from what the business wants. If stores were truly organized to support people, they would put the most popular items in the front.\nTech companies design their websites the same way. For example, when you you want to look up a Facebook event happening tonight (your reason) the Facebook app doesn\u2019t allow you to access it without first landing on the news feed (their reasons), and that\u2019s on purpose. Facebook wants to convert every reason you have for using Facebook, into their reason which is to maximize the time you spend consuming things.\nInstead, imagine if ...\nIn a Time Well Spent world, there is always a direct way to get what you want separately from what businesses want. Imagine a digital \u201cbill of rights\u201d outlining design standards that forced the products used by billions of people to let them navigate directly to what they want without needing to go through intentionally placed distractions.\nWe\u2019re told that it\u2019s enough for businesses to \u201cmake choices available.\u201d\nBusinesses naturally want to make the choices they want you to make easier, and the choices they don\u2019t want you to make harder. Magicians do the same thing. You make it easier for a spectator to pick the thing you want them to pick, and harder to pick the thing you don\u2019t.\nFor example, NYTimes.com lets you \u201cmake a free choice\u201d to cancel your digital subscription. But instead of just doing it when you hit \u201cCancel Subscription,\u201d they send you an email with information on how to cancel your account by calling a phone number that\u2019s only open at certain times.\nInstead of viewing the world in terms of availability of choices, we should view the world in terms of friction required to enact choices. Imagine a world where choices were labeled with how difficult they were to fulfill (like coefficients of friction) and there was an independent entity \u2014 an industry consortium or non-profit \u2014 that labeled these difficulties and set standards for how easy navigation should be.\nLastly, apps can exploit people\u2019s inability to forecast the consequences of a click.\nPeople don\u2019t intuitively forecast the true cost of a click when it\u2019s presented to them. Sales people use \u201cfoot in the door\u201d techniques by asking for a small innocuous request to begin with (\u201cjust one click to see which tweet got retweeted\u201d) and escalate from there (\u201cwhy don\u2019t you stay awhile?\u201d). Virtually all engagement websites use this trick.\nImagine if web browsers and smartphones, the gateways through which people make these choices, were truly watching out for people and helped them forecast the consequences of clicks (based on real data about what benefits and costs it actually had?).\nThat\u2019s why I add \u201cEstimated reading time\u201d to the top of my posts. When you put the \u201ctrue cost\u201d of a choice in front of people, you\u2019re treating your users or audience with dignity and respect. In a Time Well Spent internet, choices could be framed in terms of projected cost and benefit, so people were empowered to make informed choices by default, not by doing extra work.\nAre you upset that technology hijacks your agency? I am too. I\u2019ve listed a few techniques but there are literally thousands. Imagine whole bookshelves, seminars, workshops and trainings that teach aspiring tech entrepreneurs techniques like these. Imagine hundreds of engineers whose job every day is to invent new ways to keep you hooked.\nThe ultimate freedom is a free mind, and we need technology that\u2019s on our team to help us live, feel, think and act freely.\nWe need our smartphones, notifications screens and web browsers to be exoskeletons for our minds and interpersonal relationships that put our values, not our impulses, first. People\u2019s time is valuable. And we should protect it with the same rigor as privacy and other digital rights.\nTristan Harris was a Product Philosopher at Google until 2016 where he studied how technology affects a billion people\u2019s attention, wellbeing and behavior.

The first OO language I used was C++ and then Smalltalk and finally .NET and Java.\nI was gung-ho to leverage the benefits of Inheritance, Encapsulation, and Polymorphism. The Three Pillars of the Paradigm.\nI was eager to gain the promise of Reuse and leverage the wisdom gained by those who came before me in this new and exciting landscape.\nI couldn\u2019t contain my excitement at the thought of mapping my real-world objects into their Classes and expected the whole world to fall neatly into place.\nI couldn\u2019t have been more wrong.\nAt first glance, Inheritance appears to be the biggest benefit of the Object Oriented Paradigm. All the simplistic examples of shape hierarchies that are paraded out as examples to the newly indoctrinated seem to make logical sense.\nAnd Reuse is the word of the day. No... make that the year and perhaps evermore.\nI swallowed this whole and rushed out into the world with my newfound insight.\nWith religion in my heart and problems to solve, I started building Class Hierarchies and writing code. And all was right with the world.\nI\u2019ll never forget that day when I was ready to cash in on the promise of Reuse by inheriting from an existing class. This was the moment I had been waiting for.\nA new project came along and I thought back to that Class that I was so fond of in my last project.\nNo problem. Reuse to the rescue. All I gotta do is simply grab that Class from the other project and use it.\nWell... actually... not just that Class. We\u2019re gonna need the parent Class. But... But that\u2019s it.\nUgh... Wait... Looks like we gonna also need the parent\u2019s parent too... And then... We\u2019re going to need ALL of the parents. Okay... Okay... I handle this. No problem.\nAnd great. Now it won\u2019t compile. Why?? Oh, I see... This object contains this other object. So I\u2019m gonna need that too. No problem.\nWait... I don\u2019t just need that object. I need the object\u2019s parent and its parent\u2019s parent and so on and so on with every contained object and ALL the parents of what those contain along with their parent\u2019s, parent\u2019s, parent\u2019s...\nUgh.\nThere\u2019s a great quote by Joe Armstrong, the creator of Erlang:\nI can tame this problem by not creating hierarchies that are too deep. But if Inheritance is the key to Reuse, then any limits I place on that mechanism will surely limit the benefits of Reuse. Right?\nRight.\nSo what\u2019s a poor Object Oriented Programmer, who\u2019s had a healthy helping of the Kool-aid, to do?\nContain and Delegate. More on this later.\nSooner or later, the following problem will rear its ugly and, depending on the language, unsolvable head.\nMost OO languages do not support this, even though this seems to make logical sense. What\u2019s so difficult about supporting this in OO languages?\nWell, imagine the following pseudocode:\nNotice that both the Scanner class and the Printer class implement a function called start.\nSo which start function does the Copier class inherit? The Scanner one? The Printer one? It can\u2019t be both.\nThe solution is simple. Don\u2019t do that.\nYes that\u2019s right. Most OO languages don\u2019t let you do this.\nBut, but... what if I have to model this? I want my Reuse!\nThen you must Contain and Delegate.\nNotice here that the Copier class now contains an instance of a Printer and of a Scanner. It delegates the start function to the Printer class\u2019s implementation. It could just as easily delegated to the Scanner.\nThis problem is yet another crack in the Inheritance pillar.\nSo I\u2019m making my hierarchies shallow and keeping them from being cyclical. No diamonds for me.\nAnd all was right with the world. That is until...\nOne day, my code works and the next day it stops working. Here\u2019s the kicker. I didn\u2019t change my code.\nWell, maybe it\u2019s a bug... But wait... Something did change...\nBut it wasn\u2019t in my code. Turns out the change was in the class that I inherited from.\nHow could a change in the Base class break my code??\nThis is how...\nImagine the following Base class (It\u2019s written in Java, but it should be easy to understand if you don\u2019t know Java):\nIMPORTANT: Notice the commented line of code. This line is going to be changed later which will break things.\nThis class has 2 functions on its interface, add() and addAll(). The add() function will add a single element and addAll() will add multiple elements by calling the add function.\nAnd here\u2019s the Derived class:\nThe ArrayCount class is a specialization of the general Array class. The only behavioral difference is that the ArrayCount keeps a count of the number of elements.\nLet\u2019s look at both of these classes in detail.\nThe Array add() adds an element to a local ArrayList.The Array addAll() calls the local ArrayList add for each element.\nThe ArrayCount add() calls its parent\u2019s add() and then increments the count.The ArrayCount addAll() calls its parent\u2019s addAll() and then increments the count by the number of elements.\nAnd all works fine.\nNow for the breaking change. The commented line of code in the Base class is changed to the following:\nAs far as the owner of the Base class is concerned, it still functions as advertised. And all of the automated tests still pass.\nBut the owner is oblivious to the Derived class. And the owner of Derived class is in for a rude awakening.\nNow ArrayCount addAll() calls its parent\u2019s addAll() which internally calls the add() which has been OVERRIDEN by the Derived class.\nThis causes the count to be incremented each time the Derived class\u2019s add() is called and then it\u2019s incremented AGAIN by the number of elements that were added in the Derived class\u2019s addAll().\nIT\u2019S COUNTED TWICE.\nIf this can happen, and it does, the author of the Derived class must KNOW how the Base class has been implemented. And they must be informed about every change in the Base class since it could break their Derived class in unpredictable ways.\nUgh! This huge crack is forever threatening the stability of precious Inheritance pillar.\nOnce again Contain and Delegate to the rescue.\nBy using Contain and Delegate, we go from White Box programming to Black Box programming. With White Box programming, we have to look at the implementation of the base class.\nWith Black Box programming, we can be completely ignorant of the implementation since we cannot inject code into the Base class by overriding one of its functions. We only have to concern ourselves with the Interface.\nThis trend is disturbing...\nInheritance was supposed to be a huge win for Reuse.\nObject Oriented languages don\u2019t make Contain and Delegate easy to do. They were designed to make Inheritance easy.\nIf you\u2019re like me, you\u2019re starting to wonder about this Inheritance thing. But more important, this should shake your confidence in the power of Classification via Hierarchies.\nEvery time I start at a new company, I struggle with the problem when I\u2019m creating a place to put my Company Documents, e.g. the Employee Handbook.\nDo I create a folder called Documents and then create a folder called Company in that?\nOr do I create a folder called Company and then create a folder called Documents in that?\nBoth work. But which is right? Which is best?\nThe idea of Categorical Hierarchies was that there were Base Classes (parents) that were more general and that Derived Classes (children) were more specialized versions of those classes. And even more specialized as we make our way down the inheritance chain. (See the Shape Hierarchy above)\nBut if a parent and child could arbitrarily switch places, then clearly something is wrong with this model.\nWhat\u2019s wrong is...\nCategorical Hierarchies don\u2019t work.\nSo what are hierarchies good for?\nContainment.\nIf you look at the real world, you\u2019ll see Containment (or Exclusive Ownership) Hierarchies everywhere.\nWhat you won\u2019t find is Categorical Hierarchies. Let that sink in for a moment. The Object Oriented Paradigm was predicated upon the real world, one filled with Objects. But then it uses a broken model, viz. Categorical Hierarchies, where there is no real-world analogy.\nBut the real world is filled with Containment Hierarchies. A great example of a Containment Hierarchy is your socks. They are in a sock drawer which is contained in one drawer in your dresser which is contained in your bedroom which is contained in your house, etc.\nDirectories on your hard drive are another example of a Containment Hierarchy. They contains files.\nSo how do we categorize then?\nWell, if you think of the Company Documents, it pretty much doesn\u2019t matter where I put them. I can put them in a folder of Documents or a folder called Stuff.\nThe way I categorize it is with tags. I tag the file with the following tags:\nTags have no order or hierarchy. (This solves the Diamond Problem too.)\nTags are analogous to interfaces since you can have multiple types associated with the document.\nBut with so many cracks, it looks like the Inheritance pillar has fallen.\nGoodbye, Inheritance.\nAt first glance, Encapsulation appears to be second biggest benefit of Object Oriented Programming.\nObject state variables are protected from outside access, i.e. they\u2019re Encapsulated in the Object.\nNo longer will we have to worry about global variables that are being accessed by who-knows-who.\nEncapsulation is a Safe for your variables.\nThis Encapsulation thing is INCREDIBLE!!\nLong live Encapsulation...\nThat is until...\nFor efficiency sake, Objects are passed to functions NOT by their value but by reference.\nWhat that means is that functions will not pass the Object, but instead pass a reference or pointer to the Object.\nIf an Object is passed by reference to an Object Constructor, the constructor can put that Object reference in a private variable which is protected by Encapsulation.\nBut the passed Object is NOT safe!\nWhy not? Because some other piece of code has a pointer to the Object, viz. the code that called the Constructor. It MUST have a reference to the Object otherwise it couldn\u2019t pass it to the Constructor?\nThe Constructor will have to Clone the passed in Object. And not a shallow clone but a deep clone, i.e. every object that is contained in the passed in Object and every object in those objects and so on and so on.\nSo much for efficiency.\nAnd here\u2019s the kicker. Not all objects can be Cloned. Some have Operating System resources associated with them making cloning useless at best or at worst impossible.\nAnd EVERY single mainstream OO language has this problem.\nGoodbye, Encapsulation.\nPolymorphism was the redheaded stepchild of the Object Oriented Trinity.\nIt\u2019s sort of the Larry Fine of the group.\nEverywhere they went he was there, but he was just a supporting character.\nIt\u2019s not that Polymorphism isn\u2019t great, it\u2019s just that you don\u2019t need an Object Oriented language to get this.\nInterfaces will give you this. And without all of the baggage of OO.\nAnd with Interfaces, there isn\u2019t a limit to how many different behaviors you can mix in.\nSo without much ado, we say goodbye to OO Polymorphism and hello to interface-based Polymorphism.\nWell, OO sure promised a lot in the early days. And these promises are still being made to naive programmers sitting in classrooms, reading blogs and taking online courses.\nIt\u2019s taken me years to realize how OO lied to me. I too was wide-eyed and inexperienced and trusting.\nAnd I got burned.\nGood-bye, Object Oriented Programming.\nHello, Functional Programming. It\u2019s been so nice to work with you over the past few years.\nJust so you know, I\u2019m NOT taking any of your promises at face value. I\u2019m going to have to see it to believe it.\nOnce burned, twice shy and all.\nYou understand.\nIf you liked this, click the\ud83d\udc9a below so other people will see this here on Medium.\nIf you want to join a community of web developers learning and helping each other to develop web apps using Functional Programming in Elm please check out my Facebook Group, Learn Elm Programming https://www.facebook.com/groups/learnelm/\nMy Twitter: @cscalfani\n", "claps": "138K claps", "author": "Charles Scalfani", "comments": ["Everyone should go back to COBOL!

RealWorld example app gives us:\nRealWorld App Something more than a \u201ctodo\u201d. Usually \u201ctodos\u201d don\u2019t convey enough knowledge and perspective to actually build real applications.\nStandardized A project that conforms to certain rules. Provides a back-end API, static markup, styles, and spec.\nWritten or reviewed by an expert A consistent, real-world project that, ideally, an expert in that technology would have built or reviewed.\nAs of the writing, there are 18 implementations of Conduit at the RealWorld example app repo.\nIt doesn\u2019t matter if it has a big following or not. The only qualification is that it appears on the RealWorld repo page.\nHow long does this App take to show content and become usable?\nHow big is the App? We will only compare the size of the compiled JavaScript file(s). The CSS is common to all variants and is downloaded from a CDN (Content Delivery Network). The HTML is common to all variants, too. All technologies compile or transpile to JavaScript, thus we only size this file(s).\nHow many lines of code did the author need to create the RealWorld app based on spec? To be fair some apps have a bit more bells and whistles, but it should not have a significant impact. The only folder we quantify is src/ in each app.\nWe\u2019ll check the Performance score from Lighthouse Audit that ships with Chrome. Lighthouse returns a Performance score between 0 and 100. 0 is the lowest possible score.\nPerformance is a combined score from the following metrics\nFor more details check Lighthouse Scoring Guide.\nThe sooner you paint and the sooner someone can do something, the better the experience for the person who is using the App.\nNote: PureScript was skipped due to a lack of Demo application.\nMost of the apps score above 90. You won\u2019t probably feel a lot of difference when it comes to performance.\nTransfer size is from the Chrome network tab. GZIPed response headers plus the response body, as delivered by the server.\nThis depends on the size of your framework as well as on any extra dependencies you added, and how well your build tool can eliminate the unused code from your bundle.\nThe smaller the file, the faster the download, and less to parse.\nThere is a lot of sensational things happening in this area. Svelte \u2014 The magical disappearing UI framework \u2014 really holds true to its punch line. Stencil is the new kid in this benchmark and also performs pretty well. Both are relatively new and are pushing the limits of what is possible in terms of size.\nUsing cloc we count the lines of code in each repo\u2019s src folder. Blank and comment lines are not part of this calculation. Why is this meaningful?\nThis shows how succinct given library/framework/language is. How many lines of code do you need to implement almost the same app (some of them have a bit more belts and whistles) accordingly to the specification.\nNote Imba: Imba was skipped due to cloc not being able to process .imba files.\nNote Elm: Elm developers write the code a bit more vertically, thus the high count of LoC \u2014 at least this is what I have been told.\nNote Angular+ngrx: LoC calculation done with /libs folder only including .ts and .html files. If you believe this is wrong, please let me know what is the correct number and how did you calculate it.\nNote Hyperapp: LoC was not correct when the article was published, thanks to Mateusz Kwasniewski for pointing out the correct way to calculate LoC.\nClojureScript with re-frame gives you the most bang\ud83d\udca5 for the LoC. Clojure is known for being unusually expressive. If you care about you LoC you should check out ClojureScript, AppRun, and Svelte.\nKeep in mind that this is not exactly an apples-to-apples comparison. Some implementations use code splitting and some don\u2019t. Some of them are hosted at GitHub, some at Now and some at Netlify. Do you still want to know which one is the best? The best one is the one that fits your needs.\nQ: Do you like types? A: Look into Elm, PureScript, and TypeScript \u2014 Angular, AppRun, Dojo.\nQ: Do you want to have a very small footprint? A: Check out Svelte, Stencil, and AppRun.\nQ: Do you want to have the smallest code base to maintain? A: Check out ClojureScript with re-frame, AppRun and Svelte.\nQ: Want to learn something new?A: Pick the one you don\u2019t know!\nBecause the implementation is not completed at RealWorld repo.

It was presented to the general public on March 13, 2013 and has become since that day a must in the world of IT development.\nIt allows users to create independent and isolated environments to launch and deploy its applications. These environments are then called containers.\nThis will let the developer run a container on any machine.\nAs you can see, with Docker, there are no more dependency or compilation problems. All you have to do is launch your container and your application will launch immediately.\nHere is one of the most asked question about Docker. The answer is: actually, not quite.\nIt may look like a virtual machine at first but the functionality is not the same.\nUnlike Docker, a virtual machine will include a complete operating system. It will work independently and act like a computer.\nDocker will only share the resources of the host machine in order to run its environments.\nThis tool can really change a developer\u2019s daily life. In order to best answer this question, I have written a non-exhaustive list of the benefits you will find:\nNow that you know what Docker is, it\u2019s time to create your first application!\nThe purpose of this short tutorial is to create a Python program that displays a sentence. This program will have to be launched through Dockerfile.\nYou will see, it\u2019s not very complicated once you understand the process.\nFor Ubuntu:\nFirst, update your packages:\nNext, install docker with apt-get:\nFinally, verify that Docker is installed correctly:\nIn order to create your first Docker application, I invite you to create a folder on your computer. It must contain the following two files:\nNormally you should have this folder architecture:\nYou can add the following code to the \u2018main.py\u2019 file:\nNothing exceptional, but once you see \u201cDocker is magic!\u201d displayed in your terminal you will know that your Docker is working.\nSome theory: the first thing to do when you want to create your Dockerfile is to ask yourself what you want to do. Our goal here is to launch Python code.\nTo do this, our Docker must contain all the dependencies necessary to launch Python. A linux (Ubuntu) with Python installed on it should be enough.\nThe first step to take when you create a Docker file is to access the DockerHub website. This site contains many pre-designed images to save your time (for example: all images for linux or code languages).\nIn our case, we will type \u2018Python\u2019 in the search bar. The first result is the official image created to execute Python. Perfect, we\u2019ll use it!\nOnce your code is ready and the Dockerfile is written, all you have to do is create your image to contain your application.\nThe \u2019-t\u2019 option allows you to define the name of your image. In our case we have chosen \u2019python-test\u2019 but you can put what you want.\nOnce the image is created, your code is ready to be launched.\nYou need to put the name of your image after \u2018docker run\u2019.\nThere you go, that\u2019s it. You should normally see \u201cDocker is magic!\u201d displayed in your terminal.\nIf you want to retrieve the complete code in order to discover it more simply or to execute it, I have put it at your disposal on my GitHub.\nBefore I leave you, I have prepared a list of commands that may be useful to you on Docker.\nAfter all your feedback, I decided to write the next part of this beginner\u2019s guide. In this article, you will discover how to use docker-compose to create your first client/server-side application with Docker.\nThanks for reading!

But what do they have in common?\nIn my research, it\u2019s not just about knowing a language really well or having a particular educational background. It\u2019s that the really talented programmers have mastered the fundamentals. That foundation is what enables them to build great things and come up with breakthrough ideas.\nThink of a pyramid. It has a large base, but gradually gets smaller and thinner toward the top. Learning the fundamentals of programming forms that base. Everything takes off from there.\nSo what are those fundamentals? Based on my experience and the programmers whose backgrounds I\u2019ve researched, I see programming fundamentals as a two-part approach.\nFirst, you have to be an effective problem solver. This is an important place to start since programming is problem-solving.\nAlthough there are many ways to solve a problem, there are a few parts of the process that stand out to me. Programmers who are also great problem solvers distill a problem to its essence, in order to identify their overall aim and begin a problem with purpose. Then, they break each problem into small, manageable parts \u2014 attacking each part in turn, and sometimes in visual terms by drawing a picture to make it \u201creal world.\u201d\nThe process is harder than it sounds. When I started to program, I hit a wall: like many others, I never learned how to problem solve in school; it\u2019s a skill that\u2019s not readily taught. I was given a problem set in math class and just dove in, which is what I did when I started to program. Unsurprisingly, I was spinning my wheels unnecessarily and hitting roadblocks on the simplest of problems.\nThings began to change when I began learning about the problem solving process, and how to problem solve effectively. I now begin a problem with intent. I have George Polya\u2019s book, How to Solve It, to thank for that bit of advice.\nI\u2019ve adapted some of Polya\u2019s ideas to programming, like understanding the problem. \u201cThe problem must be understood,\u201d Polya writes. This includes being able to \u201cpoint out the principal parts of the problem, the unknown, the data and the condition.\u201d For each problem, I pull out a sheet of paper and write answers to these questions: what am I solving for or trying to find? (unknown); what am I given? (data); and what constraints or details do I need to be aware of? (condition).\nUnderstanding the problem may seem obvious, but the obvious is easily overlooked. On more than one occasion, I\u2019ve poured hours into a problem only to realize much later that I missed a small, but critical detail in the problem statement. Writing out problem details slows me down mentally, and helps me think through exactly what I need to do, which is half of the battle.\nFrom there, I make a plan, which is another of Polya\u2019s suggestions. It makes sense. I write an outline before I write an article. An artist makes a sketch of the painting before working on the painting itself. A builder uses drawings and blueprints to build a house. It\u2019s no different with programming. Instead of rushing into doing, I need to start by thinking about what I\u2019m setting out to do and make a plan of attack.\nThere are many ways to go about this. Sometimes I outline the steps I need to take in numerical order: first do this, second do that. Other times I make the problem visual. When I was learning about for loops, I pulled out a handful of almonds and physically iterated through the pile. It\u2019s a silly example, but it helped me think through the problem.\nI\u2019ll also draw pictures or diagrams. For a recursive problem, I\u2019ll draw a diagram of what\u2019s happening on each recursive call until I hit the base case. Almost always, however, I find a way to simplify the problem to make it more manageable and to help me spot a pattern. Above all, the aim for me is to enter a problem with purpose, and maintain that sense of purpose throughout.\nDespite the best made plans, problems are still hard and I still get stuck. Becoming a great problem solver takes time; it\u2019s a skill I\u2019m still working on and it\u2019s definitely worth the effort. It\u2019s a difference you can see.\nWhen I read code written by a great problem solver, it\u2019s clean and easy to understand. Variables are well named. Functions are short and crisp. Each line of code has a specific purpose; the fluff is removed. The clarity of the code mirrors the programmer\u2019s thought-process: I can read the program from top to bottom and know exactly what\u2019s going on. That\u2019s great problem solving, and that\u2019s what I\u2019m striving for.\nLearning computer science is the second programming fundamental. I recently started learning computer science, and love it because I\u2019m moving beyond surface level. I\u2019m going \u201cbehind the scenes\u201d to learn what happens when I use a built-in function, for example. I\u2019m also learning about memory and run time, among many other topics. In short, I\u2019m learning why a computer does the things it does.\nKnowing the \u201cwhy\u201d enhances my contextual knowledge and makes me a more informed programmer. As a result, I\u2019m more thoughtful with the code I write. Now that I know a bit about run time, for instance, I\u2019ll opt to use a binary search instead of iterating through each element in a list.\nIt\u2019s also enriching my understanding of how core programming concepts work. For example, I was working on a recursive problem and I wasn\u2019t getting the solution I anticipated. After close examination, I learned why: it had to do with the execution of the call stack, an idea that would\u2019ve escaped me just a few months ago.\nOr take classes. I struggled immensely with classes for the longest time, and was terrified to use one. I knew how to write a class, but wasn\u2019t confident when and why I\u2019d use one. That changed when I learned what actually happens in my computer when I create instances and call methods. It finally clicked, once I had some context. For both recursion and classes, computer science bridged gaps in my knowledge.\nAll too often, the fundamentals get pushed aside. Progress can be slow, and people tend to pick more \u201cfun\u201d stuff to work on when given the option. That\u2019s a shame. Programmers who master the fundamentals seem to code with confidence: they know the \u201chow\u201d and \u201cwhy\u201d of their programming choices, which improves their work and builds their credibility with others.\nPlus, a solid grasp of the fundamentals makes learning new languages and technologies easier to do. For example, taking the time to really understand core concepts like iteration, recursion, and abstraction with one language will help when learning another. Simply put, there\u2019s a lot to gain and little to lose by mastering the fundamentals.\nI\u2019m a writer (amymhaddad.com), and a beginner programmer.\n", "claps": "3K claps", "author": "Amy M Haddad", "comments": ["I have been a programmer and then a software engineer.

At a high level, I see a company sort of flailing about as they try to come to terms with the end of the iPhone growth era \u2014 with no single new product in line to take up the mantle. Instead, it\u2019s: services, services, services, services. And, we\u2019ll see! But this dramatic shift in focus has seemingly led to some negative side effects. Namely, it seems like Apple is slipping at the edges in ways they haven\u2019t before. Obviously, part of this \u2014 probably even a big part \u2014 is the scale at which they now operate. But still, I look at the company these days and I don\u2019t see the same attention to detail and craftsmanship across the board that many of us have grown accustomed to over the years.\nThat\u2019s why the new iPad mini is a sight for sore eyes.\nThe original iPad mini was launched in what seems to be a different era for Apple. Sure, it was a mere six and a half years ago, but the company was firing on all cylinders. And the iPad mini was, in many peoples\u2019 eyes, the pinnacle of tablets. In the intervening years, this has seemingly proven true, at least to some of us. I\u2019ve long been vocal about my love for the device, but as the entire iPad line came back to Earth, Apple stance around the iPad mini appeared to be shifting from neglect to death. After years of no updates, while the other products in the line evolved, it sure seemed like the iPad mini was laid to rest. Without a proper funeral, no less.\nAnd then a funny thing happened: it was resurrected via a tweet! This was at least somewhat expected thanks to supply chain leaks, but it still wasn\u2019t entirely clear what Apple would do to evolve the product. As it turns out, almost nothing! And this is great news!\nThat\u2019s the single most striking thing about the new iPad mini: it looks and feels exactly like my old iPad mini. The one that is three and a half years old. But the internals have been updated \u2014 A12 chip! 3GB of RAM! \u2014 so it\u2019s able to run modern applications at modern speeds.1 And this is perfect.\nI actually would have been quite annoyed if Apple had tried to completely revamp the line to be more like the \u201cedge-to-edge\u201d iPad Pro.2 A few months in, I still honestly don\u2019t love that design as much as the previous iPad variants. The iPad mini is a throw-back, Touch ID home button and all.3\nI absolutely love holding this thing in one hand, something which is technically possible with the newer iPad Pros too, but not exactly a joy. I also love the ability to slip this thing into a jacket or vest pocket with ease. It remains just 300 or so grams.\nSince it got updated to \u201cRetina\u201d, I\u2019ve long loved the screen on the iPad mini most of all the iPads. Undoubtedly this is because of the PPI \u2014 326 versus 264 for all of the other iPads, including the latest Pros. But now the screen is even better with True Tone.\nI have two nits, and both are indeed very minor.\nFirst, while it\u2019s nice to have Apple Pencil support, it\u2019s a little weird to give it first generation Pencil support. The second generation Pencil is clearly superior in every way. At the same time, that device is clearly designed to work with the newer iPad Pro design \u2014 for example, how would you charge it with this OG design, without the flat sides? \u2014 so I get it. And I guess it\u2019s nice to have a use for the older pencil again since it wasn\u2019t exactly cheap. Still, you have to charge it like an animal.4\nSecond, and bigger in my mind, is the lack of tap-to-wake on the screen. I do this all the time now on both my iPhone and latest iPad Pro. It seems like a minor thing, and in many ways, it is, but I\u2019d be lying if I didn\u2019t cite the lack of it here as a regular annoyance.\nI find it interesting how many people seem to like these \u201cretro\u201d Apple products \u2014 the iPhone SE being a prime example \u2014 versus the newer, sleeker models. Sure, some of it is nostalgia, but I can\u2019t help but feel that Apple has in many ways over-engineered many of their devices. And the reason why is at least in part (and ironically) something Apple has gotten dinged for in the past: not changing the look and feel of their hit products enough. I\u2019m starting to feel like Apple in many ways perfected the design of some of their core products years ago \u2014 older school MacBook Pro, anyone? \u2014 but keep evolving the lines because well, different.\nThis new iPad mini is decidedly retro and decidedly perfect in my view and in my hands. I would have no problem recommending it ahead of the iPad Pro for most people, which I view as overkill and again, over-engineered. The caveat being the screen size, of course. But even then, maybe the also just updated iPad Air would be a better choice for many folks?\nAnyway, thanks for not overthinking and overdoing this, Apple. Next up, how about that iPhone mini?\n1 The size plus A12 power may also make it the best Apple gaming device. Something the company should consider as it figures out how to market the forthcoming Apple Arcade service.\n2 That said, it does seem almost \u201cletterboxed\u201d with the giant bezels, especially if you have the Space Gray version which I do. It\u2019s not annoying, just sort of odd in our new era of \u201cedge-to-edge\u201d.\n3 Here\u2019s where I\u2019ll admit that \u201cswitching back\u201d to Touch ID from Face ID is pretty nice in a lot of circumstances. I\u2019m not saying I prefer it overall, necessarily. But there are times when it is no doubt a better solution. And it definitely fails less often \u2014 in some obvious situations where I know it will fail. Which just leads me to wish Apple could do both, whether with Touch ID behind the glass, or on the back as some Android devices do, or something...\n4 And yes, there remains no good place to put the Pencil when you\u2019re not using it. Given its size, the side of the iPad mini actually seems like the perfect place to clip it, magnetically or otherwise. But again, that would require a design update I don\u2019t want! So I would have created a new holster in the new iPad mini Smart Covers to hold the Pencil. This could have had the added benefit of highlighting the new Pencil capabilities for the device while also making the device look somewhat different and as such, new as well!\n", "claps": "121 claps", "author": "M.G.

Francois de La Rochefoucauld is a philosopher famed for penning a short book of stinging, pithy maxims, aimed at eliminating the illusions that we have related to our own behaviours, with particular emphasis on our desperate need to impress other people.\nThe gargantuan, overgrown beasts that we call social networks today might be unthinkable for someone from La Rochefoucauld\u2019s time, but despite being beyond that generation\u2019s reach, the man himself would probably have had a lot to say about them. One his greatest skills was his ability to perceive the underlying motives behind people\u2019s behaviour, much of which is focused on our longing for social approval\u2014a desire that forms the foundation of modern social networks. Without the \u201clike\u201d button, there probably wouldn\u2019t be a Facebook, an Instagram, or a Twitter. There may not even be a Medium. La Rochefoucauld was able to fully appreciate the power of social approval, and the extent to which it drives our behaviour.\nThe lives that we portray on social media can be vastly different to reality, with only the so-called positive aspects of our experiences shared, in an unconscious attempt to disguise the often banal truth of our day-to-day existences. Like actors on a stage, we slip on a more attractive mask, position ourselves in appealing situations, and carry out impressive performances to trick our audience into believing that our lives are something to be envied. We want to be adored, after all. The problem with such bombastic fakery is that the mask can become to the reality, and who we really are slips from our memory, to be replaced with society\u2019s notion of prestige and success\u2014the existence of an subservient toady.\nA disguise is never suitable for long, eventually we\u2019ll yearn for our heart\u2019s true desire. We must go our own way, lest we live the life of someone else. Social networks are poison to individualism, with each member striving to impress their hundreds of friends, and selling a little bit of their soul in the process. Flattery\u2014and the vanity that seeks it\u2014insidiously cuts away at our uniqueness, until there\u2019s nothing left but a shell, with social media \u201cfriends\u201d permitted to fill it up with whatever they want.\nMuch of our social posting\u2014our political rants, jokes, daily gripes, TV recommendations, social commentary, or anything else that we deem to share with the world\u2014can be traced back to our desire for approval, eyes darting to the alluring notification icon whenever it appears, yearning for people to like what we have to say. The scope can even be widened to any interaction that we have with people. As highly social animals, a great deal of our mutterings are made with the intention to impress. How often would you make a comment that you know would agitate your audience, darkening your reputation in the process?\nLa Rochefoucauld believed that without our own rapacious sense of vanity to spur us on, we\u2019d be a hell of a lot quieter. But as long as there\u2019s admiration to be had, we\u2019ll capture it in whatever way that we can (provided it doesn\u2019t offend anyone important).\nThese assertions about our good natures may arrive with a painful sting, perhaps a righteous, offended position of denial. Other people may be so insecure as to behave in such sycophantic ways, but me? Pfft. Observe your behaviour more closely, and you may discover that the French philosopher is much more accurate than you\u2019d like to believe.\nAn overly-contrived person\u2014who we might call a \u201csuck-up\u201d or a \u201ctry-hard\u201d\u2014is just someone who fails to impress surreptitiously, like the rest of us. There\u2019s a tendency to dislike these kinds of people, because their pronounced ulterior motive shines a glaring, unflattering light on our own. The traits that we dislike about others are often the traits that we dislike (or flat-out deny) about ourselves. The unfriend button never looked so appealing.\nEven the deeds that we deem the most wholesome may crumble under meticulous scrutiny. Why do you really give to charity? To help the unfortunate, or to experience the glowing sense of goodness that accompanies it, and the properly-deserved swathes of likes that attach themselves to the social share? How much of your behaviour is ultimately selfish? This isn\u2019t an advocation to stop giving to charity\u2014the motives behind such acts are inconsequential, because a good deed is being done regardless\u2014but an invitation to be inquisitive about your behaviour.\nOvercoming fakery in order to live a more genuine life seemed of paramount importance to La Rochefoucauld. A world in which the judgmental eyes of your fellow Facebook friends are banished beyond redemption is a world in which virtue could thrive for its own sake, without thought of reward\u2014a desire to be good for no other reason than goodness itself. What could be more beautiful than that?\nSocial networks are an inexhaustible source of fuel for our vanity\u2014a platform that allows us to focus our efforts on getting as much kudos as possible, regardless of its obvious mediocrity, and lack of durability. It doesn\u2019t take much to share a meme on Instagram, but damn, how good do those likes feel? Social networks are an addictive distraction from worthier endeavours\u2014meaningful activities that actually contain the potential to improve our lives, as opposed to having our precious egos soothed with worthless virtual approval.\nSadly, life is a little more complicated than just doing whatever the hell we want, without consideration of social consequences. Though we may be aching to post a caustic response to our cousin\u2019s imbecilic right-wing social post, self-preservation stays our hand. There\u2019s good logical sense behind our desire to impress\u2014we need other people to survive. Sociality is a delicate balancing act, with soulless flattery on the one side, and courageous individualism on the other. Though it\u2019s possible and infinitely more valuable to sway towards individualism, and live in accordance with our own meaningful values, survival requires us to appear favourably in the eyes of others, or risk wasting away in isolation. The social nature of our species is the reason for our innate vanity, and it isn\u2019t going away anytime soon. Though the razor-sharp vision of La Rochefoucauld may cut through the illusion of our selfish behaviours, it doesn\u2019t deter from that the fact that we need other people to survive, at least in some small degree. These people can be found in the world around us, not just as faces on computer screens, characterised by counterfeit tales of perfectly edited lives.\nSocial networks are vanity on crack, and the acerbic mind of La Rochefoucauld would probably have condemned them to the dust heap of history, where they undoubtedly belong.\nOriginally published at https://antidotesforchimps.com on April 20, 2019.\n", "claps": "253 claps", "author": "Rob Marchant", "comments": ["Wow.

That\u2019s the message the company wanted to get across when it held a flashy event on April 4 in Los Angeles, unveiling a ton of new and quirky ideas designed to lure users back to its app.\nThe presentation could have been mistaken at first for a yellow-tinted Apple event, but the company showed off a bunch of creative new ideas, from an in-app gaming platform to Snap stories coming to outside apps like Tinder. But the standout was a new feature called Landmarkers, which allows you to remix the world around you with augmented reality filters in real time.\nIf you\u2019re visiting a famous landmark, like the Eiffel Tower, tapping and holding within the camera will reveal special new filters. Tap a filter, and Snapchat will layer another reality on top of it, seamlessly blending the real and virtual worlds together. The demo teased the Eiffel Tower vomiting rainbows, New York\u2019s Flatiron Building covered in 3D pizza, and other psychedelic possibilities like buildings growing eyes and long necks.\nThese new \u201cfilters\u201d are driven by the community \u2014 any user can invent one using free software \u2014 allowing creators to make a mark on the physical world by intimately tying it with the digital one. Landmarkers is a genius move, not because it\u2019s weird or perfectly targeted to millennials\u2019 sensibilities \u2014 though it is \u2014 but because Snapchat wants to redefine the way we think about cameras. The camera is now the app.\nMy initial reaction to the feature\u2019s demo was one of confusion: Why would Snapchat build this? But that confusion quickly morphed into a realization that I was watching the beginning of the next wave of photography: the intersection between what\u2019s real and what\u2019s invented.\nTo understand why Landmarkers might change photography, we have to zoom out.\nCameras have always been driven by trends, with the format evolving in time with the march of technological progress. Changes in format \u2014 black-and-white film to color, analog to digital \u2014 redefined the way users saw the world. As smartphone photography surged and put cameras online, anywhere and everywhere in the world, entire new subgenres of picture-taking emerged, evolving faster than ever before.\nWhen smartphones were in their infancy and offered consistently awful quality, mobile photography was weirder within those technological limitations. A generation grew up layering on thick filters before sharing photos online. It\u2019s easy to forget that filters were so popular that we read into their meanings or tied our emotional state to them, and we got excited when Instagram added new ones.\nToday, it\u2019s hard to remember if I used filters because I liked them or if it was just a great way to cover up how terrible those photos really were. The miniaturization of camera sensors and lenses was an incredibly complicated feat that took years to perfect, but when smartphone cameras got about as good as a point-and-shoot, filters began to disappear. Still, they defined mobile photography as a format for years.\nAs always-on 3G connectivity and better-quality cameras became ubiquitous, the next wave arrived. Stickers, layers, text on images, vertically shot videos, and ephemeral content that self-destroyed after a few hours all became the new normal, even though they were unimaginable just a few years ago. Snapchat pioneered a lot of these ideas, which we now consider a basic component of social media.\nSince 2009, Apple, Samsung, Huawei, and other smartphone makers have battled to create the \u201cbest\u201d mobile camera every year. We\u2019ve finally reached the inflection point where phone cameras are so good that we\u2019re left to argue over tiny, incremental differences in quality \u2014 differences that really don\u2019t matter anymore. What does matter is that billions of people around the world now have incredibly capable cameras in their pockets, and anyone can shoot a great photo with little effort.\nPhotography, in the way we traditionally think about it, has reached a turning point: It has become exponentially more difficult to squeeze notable technical innovation out of the hardware every year. We can see this in the latest batch of smartphones: Google focuses on software in its latest Pixel devices to push its cameras to new heights, with features like night mode and a single-lens portrait option that employs machine learning, not superior lenses, to generate better shots than ever before.\nThat prompts new questions: What is a photo, anyway? Is using software to create a better photo cheating, or is it a natural evolution of the art? The answer, clearly, is that photography has always been fluid and always will be \u2014 and that there\u2019s no going back from here.\nWhich brings us back to Snapchat\u2019s new features. Landmarkers is a bet that people want new ways to use their cameras and that the company can define an entirely new category for experiencing the world from a different perspective \u2014 invisible to the naked eye. Ingeniously, Snapchat\u2019s existing interactive selfie filters helped us grow familiar with the idea of combining the real with the virtual; applying them to the world itself is a logical next step in evolution.\nLandmarkers uses Snapchat\u2019s vast data set of photos \u2014 literally thousands of them are added to public stories of landmarks every day \u2014 to build an accurate understanding of the physical world\u2019s dynamic shapes, lighting, and viewpoints. Snap used millions of publicly shared photos from its service to create rich 3D maps of famous buildings, but it\u2019s easy to imagine Landmarkers eventually working on any building or place in the world. All of this makes the feature incredibly difficult for competitors to clone\u2014an important advantage as the company tries to win you back from Instagram.\nAugmented reality has long promised similar ideas, but they have never really arrived, because the complexities of location combined with object recognition and spatial tracking is difficult without a lot of data. Access to incredibly precise phone sensors and high-quality photos from every vantage point imaginable was not the expected solution to that problem, but Snapchat was able to quietly build the most powerful understanding of the world around us while we were just sharing photos with friends.\nThis is the intersection of the raw computing power in your phone, the precision sensors that power makes available, and the sheer ubiquity of mobile photography. Snapchat is well placed to own that format shift entirely and offers a look at where photography goes when we\u2019re not engaged in a race to the bottom for the best camera specifications. We start looking beyond the format\u2019s rules entirely for the first time, toward something radically different.\nSnap has struggled to build a convincing case for users to come back since it went public and Instagram began to steal its audience, cloning its features one by one. The company lost users for the first time in 2019, after years of incredible growth. Snap needs to win them back \u2014 and, perhaps more important, the company needs to convince investors it can do so. Landmarkers is a way of proving the company still has it, while building a moat it can finally defend against copycats. Whether or not users pay attention is another question.\nBefore we know it, though, I suspect we\u2019ll be layering our photos with 3D animated objects that aren\u2019t really there, remixing the buildings around us in psychedelic ways, and blurring the lines between what\u2019s real \u2014 or isn\u2019t \u2014 even further. And it\u2019ll be completely normal.\n", "claps": "1.8K claps", "author": "Owen Williams", "comments": [], "link": "https://onezero.medium.com/snapchat-has-created-the-next-evolution-in-photography-7f417677c80"}, {"title": "Instagram, Social Media, Addiction \u2013 Jun Wu \u2013 Medium", "num_comments": 6, "tags": ["social media", "technology", "addiction", "instagram", "psychology"], "reading_time": 6, "text": "Mindful techniques to recognize, understand and break the cycle\nWhen I scroll through my Instagram feed, I am alarmed at the number of \u201cfitness\u201d coaches on Instagram. I am a recent Instagram mommy blogger. Yet, even in the parenting community, I am bombarded by the number of moms who share their fitness journeys on Instagram. Some of these moms are legitimate fitness coaches or yoga teachers. But, many moms are working out in front of their TV screens while recording the session for their Instagram feed. They are building their mommy blogger image.\nI am alarmed.\nIn particular, I am concerned about several post-partum mothers who seems to jump back onto Instagram immediately after their babies are born. In fact, there was one woman who updated her Instagram account continuously through the last days of pregnancy, labor, after-labor and the first week back at home. Several of her posts of pre-labor workout, celebration of delivery and after-birth workout were very popular on her account. They were all videos.\nIs this necessary?\nAs a mother, I am surprised that many moms feel the need to put their private moments as a mother for the whole world to see. I remember how tired I was in the last days leading up to my labor and how tired I was the first week back home with my baby.\nIf I had to think about my Instagram feed, I\u2019d literally snap.\nThere\u2019s a reason Social Media Scheduling Applications are developed. We should at least use these Applications in times of emergency. Birthing our babies certainly qualifies as that time of emergency.\nThis makes me think that there\u2019s a bigger problem here. It is a problem related to our own self-image.\nSelf-image drives self-esteem. Self-image is also a part of our identity. Self-image is based on our perceptions of reality. It is built up over time and continues to evolve with us.\nThere are three elements of your self-image:\nWith repeated exposure to an augmented reality on Instagram, two cognitive processes enable Instagram to affect your self-image.\nWhen you upload a post on Instagram, you wait for a reaction, then you receive \u201clikes\u201d and \u201ccomments\u201d that act as rewards. This Dopamine Feedback loop: perform action-> waiting for reaction-> reward causes your neurons to release more dopamine in your brain.\nIn the short term, you will feel good for some time. With more \u201clikes\u201d and \u201ccomments\u201d, you will post more. Eventually, you are trapped in a cycle of seeking your neurons to release more dopamine. However, with each cycle of dopamine release, your brain becomes less sensitive to the effects of dopamine. Eventually, this becomes an addictive cycle that resembles the cycle experienced by drug addicts.\nCognitive Dissonance is the discomfort of holding two opposing ideas simultaneously. When you feel that you are an \u201cattractive\u201d person in real life, then you post your pictures on Instagram. You don\u2019t receive as many \u201clikes\u201d and \u201ccomments\u201d as you hoped on Instagram. You start to question whether you are \u201cattractive\u201d at all. Scrolling through celebrity feeds with more \u201cattractive\u201d people reinforces the notion that you are not as \u201cattractive\u201d on Instagram based on the amount of \u201clikes\u201d and \u201ccomments\u201d.\nYou are compelled to resolve this cognitive dissonance by performing either one of the three actions below:\nMost people end up choosing choice 3 because it causes less emotional stress. Choosing choice 1 or choice 2 will either narrow the scope of your augmented reality or make you upset.\nInstagram is an image-oriented Social Media Application. Compared to other less image-oriented application, it has the most potential to affect your self-image.\nInstagram affects your self-image in different ways:\nThere are several ways that you can recognize the effects of Instagram and other Social Media Applications on yourself.\nThere are several ways that you can limit the effects of Instagram and other Social Media Applications on yourself.\nArmed with these strategies to recognize and limit your own Instagram and Social Media usage, it will be easier to use social media for your own intended purposes. Instead of letting social media affect your own self-image and being addicted to using social media, you can enjoy social media interactions within your own social media community.\nReferences:\nThe Dopamine Seeking-Reward Loop\n10 Tips to Handle Cognitive Dissonance in Social Media\nIn Defense of the Internet: The Relationship between Internet Communication and Depression, Loneliness, Self-Esteem, and Perceived Social Support\nIf you liked this article, you might also like to read these:\nAbout the Author\nJun Wu is a technologist turned freelance writer and a single mom.

Others know how to collect the pieces and rebuild. Often I exist in the space between the two.\nLast year, I deleted Facebook. A few weeks ago, I retired my Instagram account. Recently, I deleted my Twitter account, where I had nearly 6,000 followers. Peers are apoplectic because who deletes their social media? Friends wonder how I\u2019ll keep up with them, and more importantly, what will I do without Facebook alerting me of their birthdays? Apparently, these are very important questions. The questions of our time.\nA friend tells me I\u2019ve isolated myself\u2014what she doesn\u2019t understand is that the act of removing the social burdens we bear is fucking liberating.\nMaybe we should ask ourselves: When did we become lazy in our relationships? When did we start relying on platforms that own our information to do the work of conversation and connection? When did it become abnormal to not have a social media presence?\nHonestly, I\u2019ve grown tired of measuring the depth of my connection with the world based on how I was posting carefully curated and edited information about my life. People bemoan the fakeness of social media in pursuit of the real, but they don\u2019t actually want real. More positivity in posts means higher follower counts; people want to follow those who don\u2019t share much negativity, and that\u2019s a fact. Funny how we talk about the plastic nature of social media as if it were a thing removed from us. As if social media were an entity we didn\u2019t actively shape and participate in. As if we aren\u2019t the people perpetuating this false reality\u2014regardless whether we\u2019re conscious of it.\nBecause everyone loves a happy ending, a triumphant comeback story.\nI\u2019m good at using language to disguise my wounds. I\u2019ve spent the greater part of 35 years talking about how love and loss are flip sides of the same coin. The line between the two is indecipherable. I published two books about women who lived in a constant state of dressing their wounds. I write essays that are cryptic and poetic and people clap and say, \u201cdamn that was pretty,\u201d before they up and leave.\nDepression is tricky for someone like me who\u2019s obsessed with control. Once I think I have my illness figured out, it changes form. Often, I exist in the space between being frightened of death and welcoming it. I hate flying on planes and riding in fast cars, but I\u2019ll warm to the weight of 30 or 40 pills in my hand before I slide them back in the bottle.\nI saw a post in a hate forum about a friend I know. We are acquaintances who share a certain level of intimacy because we\u2019ve courted death and can speak plainly about it. We trade bad jokes about suicide and laugh because it\u2019s a way of coping, a way of setting down the weight that threatens to swallow us whole. And the people with their anonymous and clever usernames cut into her because of how she handled seeking treatment for her illness. She wasn\u2019t supposed to say anything on social media\u2014she wasn\u2019t supposed to speak at all. She was supposed to disappear and deal with it because that\u2019s how they would have handled it.\nPeople who aren\u2019t sick would have us stay silent if they had their way, and yet out of the other side of their mouths, they\u2019ll prattle on about \u201cbreaking the stigma\u201d and wishing that people who suffer would \u201cget the help they need.\u201d Their empathy chorus is hollow and grating because they believe a binary exists\u2014you either want to die or you don\u2019t\u2014and they see only a singular way of handling mental illness. Call the hotlines. Go offline. Seek therapy. Take your meds. Go to yoga. Collect crystals. Go on that juice diet everyone raves about. Or maybe keto? Be humble. Take your medicine. Don\u2019t cry publicly. Don\u2019t humiliate yourself. Tape your mouth shut. Swallow whatever voice you have left. Don\u2019t complain about the people telling you to call the hotlines. Don\u2019t get angry at the people who don\u2019t know what to say, as if any of us should settle for scraps. Don\u2019t let the healthy bear any of the weight of our sickness. Smile and speak in exclamation points! Use appropriate emojis.\nDon\u2019t make the healthy feel uncomfortable because god-fucking-forbid.\nBut here\u2019s the reality: Those of us who are mentally ill are going to act mentally ill because we\u2019re human and we hurt in the worst way. We aren\u2019t going to make the best choices or know how to talk about our illness publicly because we\u2019re human. And we\u2019re forever existing under the burden of being instructed by those who are not ill on how to behave. They keep telling us how to live.\nAnd, oh, do we have to behave.\nNot too long ago, I posted a series of stories on my private Instagram. I had just recovered from an anxiety attack, returned from urgent care, and was heavily medicated. I talked about my stress in a series of videos and while hundreds of my \u201cfriends\u201d watched them, only three actually reached out. The knowledge that people saw my pain and didn\u2019t seem to care enough to reach out was worse than the actual cause of my anxiety.\nA few weeks later, I did the same on Twitter and was immediately ashamed. I knew why I did it\u2014I wanted to open my mouth and scream but it felt as if no sound came out. I didn\u2019t want to die, but the hurt was so palpable and constant. Our bodies are designed to handle only so much pain. What happens with the overflow? Where does the pain go? Are we forced to contain it until we shudder and burst? A few kind friends followed up and I was grateful for their love and friendship. Two reported my posts to Twitter, and I received a form letter about \u201creaching out\u201d and \u201cgetting help\u201d as if people who have depression don\u2019t already know these things. The irony was that I was reaching out, but apparently, my pain was too much for others to witness. That form letter was yet another piece of duct tape affixed to my mouth. Others unfollowed me and didn\u2019t care at all.\nFriendships are tenuous and their upkeep is hard. I realized that people\u2019s tolerance for anxiety and depression comes with a best-by date.\nI\u2019m in a much better place now because I deleted all of my social media and decided to do a lot of work offline. I\u2019m keeping in touch with the people I care about without relying on social media to tell me the goings-on in their lives. Luckily, I don\u2019t need social media for the kind of work I do, with the exception of possibly LinkedIn and my work accounts, all of which I\u2019ll maintain for professional purposes. However, I\u2019m deciding to keep a lot of my personal life offline with the exception of sharing the occasional essay and chatting with my newsletter subscribers.\nThe act of being vulnerable, laying yourself out, is painful when the collective response is an uncomfortable silence. We all need to be honest with what we tolerate versus what we say we tolerate. Perhaps compassion has its limits. Granted, I have work to do, but I\u2019ve decided much of it is best done offline.\nRight now, I\u2019m not in danger. I don\u2019t want to die, but I\u2019ve wanted to not exist. I\u2019ve wanted to fall out of the frame, curl up and recede. I wanted to say those words out loud because my body feels like a container and there\u2019s only so much pain I can take before I burst and break. I want to feel less pain but that doesn\u2019t necessarily mean I\u2019m uncapping prescription pills with abandon.\nYet any signs of mental illness and\u2014snap\u2014let\u2019s report those posts so the depressed are greeted by form emails with numbers to call and websites to visit. As if people don\u2019t already fucking know. As if so many of us don\u2019t want to call the numbers just yet, but we just want to be seen and loved and unburdened of our unfathomable sadness. But\u2014snap\u2014let\u2019s set off the five-alarm fires. Snap\u2014let\u2019s treat you like the spectacle you are, the \u201csick\u201d person. The \u201ccrazy\u201d person. Let\u2019s usher out our condescending platitudes and you should reach out if you want help but we\u2019ll shut you down when you reach out because god forbid we feel uncomfortable. God forbid we realize depression is more complicated than Twitter would have us believe.\nPeople with depression and mental illness are not sideshow attractions here for your hair-petting and amusement. If you don\u2019t know how to deal with someone with depression, ask a professional. Open a browser and Google it. Put in some effort.\nWe\u2019re not here for your condescension.

It permeates through empty corners and fills our rooms with substance. It can help you relax, make you well up in tears, or feel alive.\nBut can it make you more productive?\nWe use music to set the tone of our environment and our mood, whether we\u2019re unwinding after work or throwing a party. But in an age when many of us spend our time staring at a computer screen, music has also become a mode of escape from outside distractions or dull tasks.\nSo how useful is music when it comes to focusing on your work?\nLet\u2019s take a look at the science behind music and productivity.\nTeresa Lesiuk, an assistant professor in the music therapy program at the University of Miami, does research on the effect of music listening on work performance. According to Dr. Lesiuk\u2019s research, those who listened to music completed their tasks more quickly and had better ideas than those who didn\u2019t overall.\nBut there are some types of music that worsen productivity. Several studies have shown that popular music interferes with reading comprehension and information processing.\nBased on these studies then, music can have a positive effect in your work. However, its effect on productivity depends on the situation and type of music.\nWhen I work, I find it very hard to concentrate when people are talking. Similarly, listening to music with lyrics is almost as distracting.\nIt turns out I\u2019m not alone. Music can be considered a form of multi-tasking, where the listener is switching back and forth between a task and the music, as opposed to the music simply playing a background role.\nOnce again, this depends on the type of music and the listener\u2019s habits. Dr. Haake does research on music listening at work, and she identified certain factors that could determine whether music is distracting:\nWhile it\u2019s not a one-size-fits-all scenario, there are certain types of music that are better to listen to while you work. Let\u2019s look at their effects and how they impact you.\nWhen we think of classical music, composers such as Bach, Vivaldi, and Handel come up in our thoughts. In a study, seven out of eight radiologists found that baroque music increased mood and concentration on their work. If you\u2019re looking for where to begin, try Vivaldi\u2019s quick-tempo \u201cFour Seasons\u201d.\nListening to the sounds of nature can enhance cognitive function and concentration. Soothing sounds such as flowing water, rainfall, and rustling leaves work well, while jarring noises such as bird calls and animal noises can be distracting.\nEpic music can make you feel like you\u2019re doing something grandiose to change the world. It empowers and lifts you up. So if you\u2019re feeling tired and uninspired during your work, try listening to some epic music to give you that extra boost of motivation.\nMusic from video games is a great choice because the compositions are specifically designed to enhance your gaming experience. After all, it\u2019s pretty crucial you dodge that fire, or skillfully maneuver your way through hordes of enemies. For starters, try the Bastion soundtrack, or one of the SimCity soundtracks, to name a few.\nIf you\u2019re feeling stressed out at work, give ambient music a try. As Brian Eno, creator of Music for Airports, says:\nThere\u2019s a number of other types of music you can listen to during work, such as meditation music, blues, or jazz, to name a few. If you just want to get rid of your chatty coworkers or the nearby printer, use \u201cwhite noise\u201d to cancel them out.\nExperiment and see what works. Soft and mellow may help you to focus on your work, while a high energy piece can keep you motivated.

Of course, there is no way of knowing for sure since they do not announce their system to the public, as that would lead to abuse of the system creating an uneven playing field. Secret algorithms allow search engines to index sites without public knowledge of the parameters used.\nSEO Site Speed Factors\nTheoretically, one factor used to determine your website\u2019s rank on Google, Bing, and other search engines are SEO Site Speed. Historically, site speed was not a significant factor in a ranking website, as before proper algorithm development it was all about keyword stuffing; however, that appears to be changing. Yet, an essential aspect of site speed may have nothing to do with rankings at all.\nThe fact is that most internet searchers will wait no more than a few seconds for your site to load before they will opt out and click on the next result on the search engine results page (SERP). This impatience by users should be the most critical consideration in reducing loading times for your site. Readers do not stay on a slow site very long either, so the bounce rate is often higher. A high bounce rate and Google\u2019s penalties, are valid reasons you should speed up your site. Since the user experience (UX) might not be good enough, people will not stay long enough to answer a call to action, such as registration or purchase.\nTherefore, even when you use your site as a blogging platform, your goal should be a fast site for great UX.\nDetermining SEO Site Speed\nThe first step is to determine your SEO site speed, and since each will give you a different reading, you should use as many tools as possible. This action will provide you with a more accurate reading and determines what you need to change for optimum UX.\nHere are four that I use regularly:\nGoogle\u2019s Insights will show you both desktop or mobile speed, which is very important since there has been a large crossover of searchers to mobile devices. If you check the numbers behind each analysis, Google gives you pointers regarding low numbers.\nTry to improve your numbers by working off those \u201cdeficiencies,\u201d remember these are recommendations and may not be right for your site. Some of these suggestions may require hiring a developer to fix, so you have to balance what is best for speed against what is best for your budget.\nAdditionally, Google recommends not using plugins, and whereas plugins do slow down your site to a certain degree, some such as WP Super cache speed up your website, more on that later.\nPingdom permits testing for many locations and Yahoo\u2019s Yslow segments the checks. Depending on the configuration of your site, www.mysite.com may redirect to mysite.com, which takes longer and may make your test inaccurate, so check your settings and use the proper URL. Yslow and Google are somewhat technical in their explanation, but with additional searches and YouTube or WordPress tutorials, you can do most of these yourself.\nThings You Should Fix to Speed Up Your Website:\nToday\u2019s large, high-definition images use a lot of space and take a long time to retrieve from your server. Therefore, you should prioritize optimizing these. Use a jpeg minimizer to make those jpegs smaller without compromising quality, jpegmini.com is what I use. Their ad campaign slogan is, \u201cYour Photos on a Diet.\u201d You simply cannot tell the difference between the original and an optimized photo. Also, you can use tinypng for your Portable Network Graphics (png). Or, use the Tiny PNG plugin that can optimize jpegs and png already on your site and set parameters for future media uploads. All these tools are free for limited use.\nNext, are those databases and tables. Do NOT skip this process because you believe you don\u2019t have any databases or tables. WordPress uses 11 core databases or tables, and this could expand soon, not to mention those used by plugins and those you may have manually installed.\nWhen you frequently update your website, the WordPress database or other Content Management System (CMS) you use will grow more significant over time. These large databases significantly affect your site\u2019s load time and other performance measures for your website. It takes a longer time for the server to recall information from your database tables. That is why optimizing databases frequently is vital.\nUse WP-Optimize, for your WordPress site, phpMyAdmin or Adminer are free SQL db admin tools, as well.\nInstalling a cache plugin should speed up access and page transfers within your site. When your host provider does not already administer caching for your site, WP Super Cache caches your website without a lot of whistles and bells. Some say WP Rocket is a better product, but it will cost you $39 a year. It may be worth it to you for added security and fewer hassles if you are not very technically inclined.\nSome recommend W3 Total Cache, but it might not be right for those who are not superior IT folks. Or, if you have a developer, you could ask them if it is suitable for your site speed.\nSince SEO site speed is so critical to drawing visitors to answer your CTA, you might want to try some of these techniques to speed up your website. As I stated, most are quite easy to do yourself. I particularly like Tiny PNG. I used to use jpegmini exclusively, but quite often forgot to optimize an image before uploading it and Tiny PNG is very easy to use for images already uploaded. Another solution to image optimization is the WP Smush plugin that condenses all images on your site.\nSolving many of these issues that slow your site speed leads to other problems, kind of like a Russian Nested Doll, when you open one there is another, and another, and another. So, if you have issues or not enough time to spend speeding up your website, consider contacting an SEO Expert.\nIf you need content for an About Us, Blog, or other section of your website, send me a contact form.\nOriginally published at https://the-write-results.com on February 10, 2016.\n", "claps": "303 claps", "author": "Stephen Dalton", "comments": [], "link": "https://medium.com/@stephendalton/seo-site-speed-solutions-for-your-website-website-content-writer-the-write-results-8795081da0fa"}, {"title": "7 Headline Writing Tips You Need to Know \u2013 Shane Barker \u2013 Medium", "num_comments": "unspecified", "tags": ["content creation", "content marketing", "headlines", "seo", "blogging"], "reading_time": 6, "text": "Headlines are the first thing that people see before reading any content. And, these are what determine whether or not they will go ahead and actually read your content.\nThat is why writing attention-grabbing and relevant titles should be an essential part of your content strategy. If you\u2019ve got your headlines right, then you\u2019ve already won half the battle.\nIn this post, I have listed 7 of the most effective headline writing tips that you can use to ace your headline game.\nHANDPICKED RELATED CONTENT:\nUsing numbers and statistics in your headlines immediately builds credibility and authenticity. Even if you don\u2019t provide statistics, just using a number helps the brain organize information in a logical manner, thus, making it more click-worthy.\nIf you write a listicle and tell readers exactly how many points you are going to cover, they will instantly know whether to invest time in it or not. A study conducted by Venngage clearly shows that using numbers gets more engagement than using just words.\nFor example, check out the two headlines mentioned below to see which one you\u2019re more likely to click on.\nMost people would prefer the first one because it makes a specific promise and quantifies it. It is, unquestionably, more believable and seems credible.\nUsing numbers is one of the most effective headline writing tips that anyone can give you. So, leverage this and see the results for yourself.\nPro Tip: Odd numbers tend to work better in listicles because they seem more random.\nThis might seem obvious, but a lot of people don\u2019t pay enough attention to this useful headline writing tip. You should include the exact keyword you\u2019re targeting in your headline, without exception.\nThis will help the users searching for that keyword find your content easily. It will also help your content rank well in Google search results.\nHANDPICKED RELATED CONTENT:\nThis is another useful headline writing tip that definitely works. People often search the internet looking for answers to specific questions or solutions to some challenges. You can grab their attention by using a headline that provides a solution to their problems.\nThis is probably why \u201chow to\u201d content works so well because it gives a step-by-step solution to a user query.\nCheck out this blog post headline that provides a solution to the people who are struggling to rank well on Google search results.\nImage Source\nThis is another one of the essential headline writing tips that you should try to make your headlines catchy and click-worthy. The basic concept behind this is to pique the readers\u2019 interest so that they want to know more.\nOne of the most common ways to generate curiosity is to ask questions in your headline.\nWriting question-based headlines has two benefits. First, it generates curiosity in readers to find the answer. Second, a lot of users search the internet by asking specific questions and thus question-based headlines will match their search queries and help you rank better.\nCheck the below headline from one of my blog posts. Doesn\u2019t that make you want to read further to know the answer?\nImage Source\nThis is another one of the headline writing tips that aim to generate curiosity among your audience.\nYou need to provide a hook and bait, similar to catching a fish, to make your readers want to learn more. One of the best ways to do this is by providing incomplete information and leaving your audience wondering what it is all about.\nRead the following headline and answer honestly if it didn\u2019t pique your curiosity?\nImage Source\nAnother way is to tell a shocking or even unbelievable fact in your headline so that people want to read your post to validate its authenticity.\nHANDPICKED RELATED CONTENT:\nWhat better way to grab audience attention and generate curiosity than to make a controversial statement. Making a statement that most people would object to is a real head-turner and helps get people interested.\nFor this headline writing tip to work, you should make a statement against any popular belief and then elaborate on it in your post. Just make sure that you give a twist on the popular belief instead of opposing it, otherwise, that might backfire.\nCheck out the below headline where the writer makes a controversial statement. But, in the actual content, she writes from the perspective of how men and women are different instead of saying they shouldn\u2019t be treated equally. The title, in such cases, is slightly misleading, but it does grab immediate audience attention.\nImage Source\nNo list of headline writing tips is complete without adding this expert tip. There are some words that work better than others. These magic words are usually strong action words or words that evoke some form of emotions.\nSome examples of such action words include \u201clearn,\u201d \u201cmake,\u201d \u201ccreate,\u201d \u201cexecute,\u201d etc. You can always add some more drama by adding superlatives like \u201cbest\u201d or \u201cworst\u201d and by using words like \u201calways\u201d and \u201cnever.\u201d\nFor example, read the two headlines below:\nWhich one attracts you more? I\u2019m sure it will be the second one, for most people. The reason is the use of words like \u201clearn,\u201d \u201csecrets,\u201d \u201cbest,\u201d and \u201cever.\u201d These words add that extra drama and emotion to an otherwise plain and boring headline.\nThis is one of the well-known and yet underrated headline writing tips. Everyone knows that headlines should not be too long, but while writing one they often forget.\nA lot of times people end up writing long headlines in their zest to include all of the other tricks mentioned in this post.\nAlso, keeping headlines short means that they are easier to read for people who read it on their mobile phones. They constitute a majority of your audience and hence you should keep your headlines short and easy-to-read.\nAll the other headline writing tips in this list focused on creating the best headline, but this one focuses on choosing the most effective one.\nA/B testing requires you to test various headlines and see which of those perform the best. So, if you are not sure which type of headlines work best for your audience, do a split test and find it out.\nHANDPICKED RELATED CONTENT:\nThese useful headline writing tips will surely help you write headlines that convert. Use a mix of these techniques to create powerful and engaging headlines that make your audience want to read further.\nOriginally published at Shanebarker.com.\nAbout The Author\nShane Barker is the Founder and CEO of Content Solutions and Gifographics.

He told his publisher he wanted to give the entire book away for free. You can download it here.\nThe publisher thought he was nuts. But, he published it anyway. It spread to so many people that the publisher decided to buy it.\n1. There\u2019s no friction. You don\u2019t have to enter your email address. You don\u2019t have to share it on social media to get access.\n2. There\u2019s no compromise in quality because it\u2019s free.\n3. He promotes the paid version of the book in the free version.\nSeth has a habit of poking the box, questioning the status quo, and writing his own rules.\nI knew no publisher would give me a book deal for The Scenic Route(you can read it for free). But that didn\u2019t prevent me from writing it. It\u2019s my most personal book yet. I was more interested in unleashing an ideavirus than I was in selling copies of this book.\nSo I removed the friction I hired Mars Dorian to design a cover and hired a copy editor to clean it up. It might cost several hundred dollars to produce. It might not make any money. But it\u2019s designed to spread. In the long run, an ideavirus could be more profitable than a book that sells a couple of hundred copies.\nThe primary goal of a creator who unleashes an idea virus is to make her idea spread. With an ideavirus, you make a short term sacrifice for a long term gain. The long term value gain is an idea that the spreads. The short term gain is having someone opt into your email list.\nAn audience of 1000 true fan is more valuable than attention from 1 million strangers. Tim Grahl encourages his clients to focus on selling the first 1000 copies of their book.\nWhy is 1000 copies such a big deal? Most books, traditional or self-published don\u2019t sell more than 1000 copies. It\u2019s a clear sign you\u2019ve created something that matters and makes a difference. If 1000 people download your free e-book, it\u2019s a good sign you\u2019ve unleashed an idea virus.\nUnleashing an idea virus is counterintuitive. We give up the possibility of collecting someone\u2019s email address or money for the probability that our idea will spread.\nBut unleashing an idea virus isn\u2019t about tactics. It\u2019s about emotional resonance. It\u2019s easier to get someone to do something when you can make them feel something.\nThere\u2019s nothing about the way I published the scenic route that a publisher would agree with. One version is free, beautiful and it\u2019s difficult to share. There are no social media buttons in Adobe Spark. But anyone can access it.\nThe other version is a $2.99 Kindle book. I hope that the people who buy it will cover the costs of production for the free version.\nIf you want to grow your audience, unleash an idea virus.\nOriginally published at https://unmistakablecreative.com.\n", "claps": "103 claps", "author": "Srinivas Rao", "comments": [], "link": "https://medium.com/@skooloflife/if-you-want-to-reach-a-bigger-audience-unleash-an-ideavirus-c6cd3a586e61"}, {"title": "Why I\u2019m Voting for Trump \u2013 Arc Digital", "num_comments": 600, "tags": ["life", "2016 election", "politics", "donald trump", "elections"], "reading_time": 5, "text": "I\u2019m as old as you.

No one in DC knows how to run a machine shop or a gardening service or an insurance office. They don\u2019t know what I do all day and why I do it. I used to want to retire early. Now I just want to retire on time. I\u2019ve done right by my employees and they go work for competitors. Nobody will help me so why should I help anybody else?\nI need work but I don\u2019t want a job that insults my intelligence. I didn\u2019t get much of an education but I know waking up at 7am to go put up drywall is for chumps. Where\u2019s my GI Bill? Where\u2019s my scholarship? Besides, who has time for college?

We have all the information we need to make a decision about that Crooked Hillary. You have your opinions we have ours. Facebook is a big place and our worlds don\u2019t overlap.

All the TV shows out there are about you, not me. I get like three shows with folks I recognize and sports. Those Duck Dynasty guys reminded me of my crazy uncles. Diners, Drive-Ins, and Drives was my kind of travel show. All of America isn\u2019t New York or Hollywood. I want someone who understands that.\nI don\u2019t trust the world.

I know who is and it isn\u2019t me or my friends.\nListen: We can\u2019t figure this out like this but until we figure out a better way to communicate I\u2019m voting my gut. My gut tells me this is the best thing for us all. You can\u2019t convince me otherwise this time but maybe next time you can respect my place and I\u2019ll respect yours and we can start talking.

It is, arguably, some of the worst code I\u2019ve ever seen. In order to update a single record in a database, it fetches every record in the collection, and then sends an update request for every single record in the database \u2014 not just the record that needs updating. There\u2019s a map function that does nothing but return the value it was passed. There are conditional checks for variations of seemingly the same values, named in different case styles (firstName and first_name). For every update (on every record, even the ones that haven\u2019t changed) it sends a message to a message bus that calls another serverless function that does all the work for another collection in the same database.

I bury my eyes into my fists and laugh-weep audibly. My coworkers ask me what\u2019s wrong and I give a dramatic retelling of the Worst Hits Of BulkDataImporter.js 2018, courtesy of Chuck Parsley*. Everyone nods sympathetically and we agree: how could they have done this to us?\nNegativity plays an important role in programming. It\u2019s embedded into our culture at various levels as a way to share learnings and war stories (\u201cyou won\u2019t believe what that codebase was like\u201d), express and commiserate over frustrations (\u201cfor the love of Hermes WHY would anyone do that\u201d), making ourselves look better (\u201cI would never do that\u201d), shifting blame (\u201cwe failed because of Chuck Parsley\u2019s unmaintainable code\u201d), or in the most toxic organizations, a way to shame and control others (\u201cwhat were you thinking? fix it\u201d).\nNegativity is so important to programmers because it\u2019s a very effective way to communicate value. When I taught at a coding bootcamp, it was standard practice to inculcate students into industry culture with a healthy dose of memes, stories, and videos, some of the most popular of which revolve around programmers\u2019 frustration with people who just don\u2019t get it. It\u2019s good to be able to use emotive tools to point to practices and habits that are Good, ones that are Bad, and ones that are Awful, Never Do That, Ever. It\u2019s also good to prepare newer programmers for the fact that they will probably be misunderstood in one way or another by nontechnical colleagues, that they should prepare for all of their friends to tell them their \u201cmillion\u201d dollar app ideas, that they should prepare for unending mazes of legacy code with more than one minotaur waiting around the corner.\nWhen we\u2019re first learning to code, our model of what the depth of the \u201ccoding experience\u201d is is based off of observing other people\u2019s emotional reactions to the act. You can see this pretty clearly by watching ProgrammerHumor subreddit for a while, which is populated by many newer programmers. Many posts express humor with various shades of negativity: frustration, pessimism, outrage, disillusionment, condescension, and more. (And if you really want to find the negativity, read the comments.)\nI notice that programmers often follow an upward curve of negativity as they gain experience. Fresh and new, unknowing of what difficulties await them, they start out with enthusiasm and a willingness to believe that the reason things are hard is just because they\u2019re inexperienced and don\u2019t know anything and they\u2019ll eventually have a grasp of it all.\nAs time goes on and they learn more, they gain the ability to differentiate between code that is Good and code that is Bad. Once this happens, they directly experience the frustration of working with bad code that they know is bad, and if they work in a community (whether online or in a team), they frequently adopt the emotional habits of programmers more senior to them. Frequently, this results in an increase in negativity, as they\u2019re now able to talk intelligently about code and separate good from bad in a way that shows that they \u201cget it\u201d. It pays to be more negative: it\u2019s easy to bond with coworkers over frustrations and become part of the in-group, it increases your status by decreasing the status of the Bad code in comparison, and it can help you be perceived as a better engineer: people who express opinions negatively are frequently viewed as both more intelligent and more competent.\nThis increase in negativity isn\u2019t necessarily a bad thing. Discourse about programming is, above all things, extremely focused on the quality of the code written. What the code actually is determines everything about the function that it\u2019s designed to do (handwaving away hardware, networks, etc.), so being able to express an opinion about code is important. Almost all discussion of code comes down to a decision about whether it\u2019s good enough or not, and the judgment of bad code manifests itself in a statement whose emotive charge implies the quality (or lack thereof) of the code:\n(Incidentally, this \u201cemotive charge\u201d is what leads developers to call code \u201csexy\u201d, which is rarely deserved \u2014 unless you work at PornHub.)\nThe issue, of course, is that human beings are weird, wiggly little water-filled emotion sacks and both receiving and expressing any emotion changes us \u2014 microscopically at first, and over the long run, fundamentally.\nA few years ago I was an informal team lead, interviewing a developer for my company. We liked him a lot; he was sharp, asked good questions, had the technical chops, and he was a great culture fit. I particularly liked how positive and how much of a \u201cgo-getter\u201d he seemed to be. So we hired him.\nAt this time, I had been at my company for a couple years and had perceived a lack of follow-through in the company culture. We tried to launch a product twice, thrice, and and a couple more times before I had arrived, leading to expensive rewrites with nothing to show for it but many long nights, punted deadlines, and kind-of-working products. While I still showed up and worked hard, I was vocal about my skepticism about the latest deadline handed down from management. I swore casually when discussing certain unfavorites in the code with my colleagues.\nI shouldn\u2019t have been surprised \u2014 but I was \u2014 when a few weeks in, the new developer we had hired expressed the same type of negativity I had (including the cussing). I got the feeling that this wasn\u2019t how he would act on his own or in another company with a different culture. Rather, he was adopting the culture that I had set in order to fit in. I felt a pang of guilt. Because of my own subjective experience, I managed to set a pessimistic tone for a new employee who I perceived to be very much not that way. Even if it wasn\u2019t a sentiment he really believed, and only expressed himself that way in an attempt to show that he could fit in with his peers, I had pushed my shitty attitude onto him. And things said, even in jest or to get along, have a bad habit of becoming things believed.\nA happy story for our now-intermediate developer from before who has gained a little wisdom and a little experience goes like this: they get to see more of the programming industry, and realize that bad code is everywhere and inescapable. Bad code exists in even the most cutting edge, quality-focused companies. (And let me tell you \u2014 modernity is not always the antidote to bad code it often seems like.)\nGoing into the future, they begin to accept that bad code is simply a reality of software, and it\u2019s their job to make it better. Since there\u2019s no escaping bad code, there\u2019s not much point to making a fuss about it, either. They approach the path of zen, focus on how to solve the problem or task put before them, learn how to accurately measure and convey the quality of software to business stakeholders, create beautifully described estimates from their many years of experience, and end up being rewarded handsomely for their incredible and consistent value to the business. They do such a good job that they\u2019re awarded a $10 million spot bonus and they retire to do whatever they want for the rest of their life. (Please don\u2019t take this from me.)\nThe flip side is the path of darkness. Instead of accepting that bad code is an inevitability, they take up the mantle of proclaiming all that is wrong with the world of code so that they might vanquish it. They refuse to normalize the existence bad code for a lot of good reasons: people should know better and be less stupid; it\u2019s offensive; it\u2019s bad for the business; this is proof of how smart I am; if I don\u2019t express just how shit this code is this entire company is going to detach from the country and sink into the ocean; etc.\nLikely in a position where they are unable to make the changes they desire because the business unfortunately must continue developing features and doesn\u2019t have time to care about code quality, they become known as the complainer. Because they\u2019re still highly competent, they\u2019re kept around, but relegated to a corner of the company where they won\u2019t bother too many people but will keep critical systems running. Cut off from access to fresh development opportunities, their skills atrophy and they lose relevancy in the industry. Their negativity festers and curdles into a hardened bitterness until they eventually find themselves sustaining their ego by arguing with 20-year-old CS students about the way that their favorite years-old technology did it and why it\u2019s still the way to go. Eventually, they retire and spend their old age yelling at birds.\nReality probably sits somewhere between these two extremes.\nA few companies do exceedingly well with extremely negative, territorial, forceful cultures, such as Microsoft before its lost decade \u2014 often those with an existing product with an excellent market fit and the need to scale as quickly as possible, or command-and-control structures (Apple during Steve Jobs\u2019 heyday) where everybody does what one person says so how they say it doesn\u2019t matter much. However, modern business studies (and now, common sense) show over and over that the peak creativity that leads to innovation on the large scale and high performance on the small scale require low levels of stress that enable flow, creative thinking, and methodical thinking. It is extremely difficult to do linguistically-driven, creative work when you\u2019re worried about what your colleague will have to say about every line of code you write.\nToday, a greater spotlight is being shone on engineer\u2019s attitudes than ever. The idea of a \u201cNo Asshole Rule\u201d is increasingly common in engineering organizations. More and more anecdotes pop up in the Twittersphere with accounts of people leaving engineering entirely because they simply couldn\u2019t (wouldn\u2019t) put up with the hostility and territorial attitudes toward outsiders. Even Linus Torvalds recently apologized for his years of hostility and berating of other Linux developers \u2014 to much debate over its effectiveness.\nSome still uphold Linus\u2019 now discarded right to be excessively critical \u2014 someone who should know quite a bit about the pros and cons of toxic negativity. It\u2019s true that correctness is incredibly important (fundamental, even), but when you boil down many people\u2019s reasons for allowing the expression of a negative opinion to fall into toxicity, they begin to sound paternalistic or adolescent: they deserve it for being stupid, he needs to make sure they don\u2019t do it again, if they didn\u2019t do that he wouldn\u2019t have to yell at them, etc. (For another example of how much of an impact the emotive tendencies of a leader has on a programming community, we can look at the MINASWAN refrain of the Ruby community \u2014\u201cMatz [the creator of Ruby] is nice so we are nice\u201d.)\nI\u2019ve found that the most ardent promoters of a \u201ckill the fool\u201d mentality are often those who care deeply about the quality and correctness of code, and hang their identities on their work. Unfortunately, they often confuse firmness with harshness. The darkest side of this attitude comes from the completely human but unproductive desire to feel superior to others. The people who retreat into this desire are the ones who tend to stay stuck on the path of darkness.\nThe world of code is quickly expanding to meet the edges of its container, the world of noncode. (Or is the world of code the container for the world of noncode? A question for another time.)\nAs our industry grows at an increasingly rapid pace and programming becomes more and more accessible, the distance between \u201ctechie\u201d and \u201cnormie\u201d is shrinking quickly. Our world of code will become increasingly exposed to the interpersonal styles of people who did not grow up in the isolated nerd culture of the early tech boom, and eventually they will become the new world of code. And regardless of any social or generational argument, efficiency in the name of capitalism will show itself in company culture and hiring practices: the best businesses simply will not hire those who cannot play neutrally with others, let alone play nice.\nLetting excessive negativity dominate your mindset and communication and spilling over into toxicity is dangerous to productive teams and expensive for businesses. I can\u2019t tell you the number of software projects that I have seen (and heard of) get torn down and completely rebuilt at great cost because one trusted software developer had an axe to grind with a technology, a former developer, or a single file they took to be representative of the quality of the entire codebase. It\u2019s also demoralizing and strains relationships. I\u2019ll never forget an incident where I was berated by a coworker for putting CSS in the wrong file, which upset me and distracted my thoughts for days. I\u2019m also very unlikely to ever let that person near one of my teams in the future. (But who knows? People change.)\nIt\u2019s also literally bad for your health.\nThis isn\u2019t an argument for sunshine and rainbows attitudes, ten billion emojis on every pull request, or smiling workshops. (Of course, if that\u2019s how you want to roll, go for it.) Negativity plays an extremely important part in programming (and human life) as a way to signal quality, to express our feelings, and to commiserate with our fellow human beings. It\u2019s a signal of discernment and judiciousness or the severity of a problem. I can often tell that a developer has reached a new level when they begin to express disbelief where before they had been timid and unsure. They\u2019re demonstrating their discernment, and their confidence in their own opinions. Negative expression cannot be discarded \u2014 that would be Orwellian.\nHowever, it should be dosed with other essential human qualities: compassion, patience, understatement, and humor. And where necessary, you can always tell someone when they screwed up, without the screaming and cursing. (Don\u2019t underestimate this; being told you seriously messed up in a completely unemotional way is a frightening experience.)\nAt that company from a few years ago, the CEO grabbed me for a chat. We made small talk and discussed the current state of the project for a while, then he asked me how I thought I was doing. I told him that I thought I was doing pretty well, we were making progress on the project, we were plugging along, there were probably some things I was missing and needed to renew my focus on. He told me that he had heard me sharing some of my more pessimistic thoughts around the office, and that other people had noticed it as well. He explained that if I have concerns, I can push those up to management as much as I want but to be careful not to push them down. As a leading engineer at the company, I had to be mindful of the impact my words have on others, because I wield a lot of influence, whether I realize it or not. He said all of this very kindly, and ended by saying that if I\u2019m feeling this way, I should probably think about what I want for myself and my career. It was an extremely gentle \u201cshape up or ship out\u201d conversation. I thanked him for letting me know and acknowledged that my attitude had slipped over the last six months without my noticing how it might be affecting others.\nIt was an example of excellent, effective management and the power of a gentle touch. I realized that while I had thought I believed fully in the company and its ability to accomplish its goals, in reality I was saying and communicating to others something very different. I also realized that just because I felt skeptical about the project I was working on, that didn\u2019t mean that I needed to express that feeling to my coworkers and spread my pessimism like a contagion, making it even less likely for us to succeed. Instead, I could aggressively communicate reality up to my managers. And if I ultimately felt that they weren\u2019t listening, I could express my dissent with my feet.\nA new opportunity eventually found me, where I got to work in an official HR-performance-evaluating manager role. As a formal engineering manager, I\u2019m increasingly careful to monitor how I express my opinions about our (constantly improving) legacy code. To enact change, you must acknowledge the reality of the current situation, but you get nowhere if you get mired down in the bemoaning, belaboring, or bewhatevering the situation. Ultimately, I\u2019m here to accomplish a task, and I don\u2019t have to complain about code in order to understand it, estimate it, or fix it.\nIn fact, the more I restrained my emotional reaction to code, the clearer my vision of what it could be become, and the less inner turmoil I experienced. When I practiced understatement (\u201cthere might be opportunities for improvement here\u201d), I amused myself and others and took the situation less personally. I also realized that I could defuse and uplift other\u2019s negativity by being perfectly (annoyingly?) sensible (\u201cyou\u2019re right, that code is pretty bad, but we\u2019ll improve it\u201d). I\u2019m excited to see how far along I can travel the path of zen.\nFundamentally, I\u2019m continually learning and relearning a deeper lesson: life is just too short to be pissed off and miserable all the time.\nP.S.: If you like this post, clap it. (That doesn\u2019t sound weird.) And if you\u2019d like to check out where I\u2019m attempting the path of negativity zen, my company is hiring.\n\u2014\n*Chuck Parsley is not a real person.

I had just finished my graduate studies and joined a global investment bank as an analyst. On my first day, I kept straightening my tie and trying to remember everything that I had studied. Meanwhile, deep down, I wondered if I was good enough for the corporate world. Sensing my anxiety, my boss smiled and said:\n\u201cDon\u2019t worry! The only thing that you need to know is the regression modeling!\u201d\nI remember thinking myself, \u201cI got this!\u201d. I knew regression modeling; both linear and logistic regression. My boss was right. In my tenure, I exclusively built regression-based statistical models. I wasn\u2019t alone. In fact, at that time, regression modeling was the undisputed queen of predictive analytics. Fast forward fifteen years, the era of regression modeling is over. The old queen has passed. Long live the new queen with a funky name; XGBoost or Extreme Gradient Boosting!\nXGBoost is a decision-tree-based ensemble Machine Learning algorithm that uses a gradient boosting framework. In prediction problems involving unstructured data (images, text, etc.) artificial neural networks tend to outperform all other algorithms or frameworks. However, when it comes to small-to-medium structured/tabular data, decision tree based algorithms are considered best-in-class right now. Please see the chart below for the evolution of tree-based algorithms over the years.\nXGBoost algorithm was developed as a research project at the University of Washington. Tianqi Chen and Carlos Guestrin presented their paper at SIGKDD Conference in 2016 and caught the Machine Learning world by fire. Since its introduction, this algorithm has not only been credited with winning numerous Kaggle competitions but also for being the driving force under the hood for several cutting-edge industry applications. As a result, there is a strong community of data scientists contributing to the XGBoost open source projects with ~350 contributors and ~3,600 commits on GitHub. The algorithm differentiates itself in the following ways:\nDecision trees, in their simplest form, are easy-to-visualize and fairly interpretable algorithms but building intuition for the next-generation of tree-based algorithms can be a bit tricky. See below for a simple analogy to better understand the evolution of tree-based algorithms.\nImagine that you are a hiring manager interviewing several candidates with excellent qualifications. Each step of the evolution of tree-based algorithms can be viewed as a version of the interview process.\nXGBoost and Gradient Boosting Machines (GBMs) are both ensemble tree methods that apply the principle of boosting weak learners (CARTs generally) using the gradient descent architecture. However, XGBoost improves upon the base GBM framework through systems optimization and algorithmic enhancements.\nSystem Optimization:\nAlgorithmic Enhancements:\nWe used Scikit-learn\u2019s \u2018Make_Classification\u2019 data package to create a random sample of 1 million data points with 20 features (2 informative and 2 redundant). We tested several algorithms such as Logistic Regression, Random Forest, standard Gradient Boosting, and XGBoost.\nAs demonstrated in the chart above, XGBoost model has the best combination of prediction performance and processing time compared to other algorithms. Other rigorous benchmarking studies have produced similar results. No wonder XGBoost is widely used in recent Data Science competitions.\nWhen it comes to Machine Learning (or even life for that matter), there is no free lunch. As Data Scientists, we must test all possible algorithms for data at hand to identify the champion algorithm. Besides, picking the right algorithm is not enough. We must also choose the right configuration of the algorithm for a dataset by tuning the hyper-parameters. Furthermore, there are several other considerations for choosing the winning algorithm such as computational complexity, explainability, and ease of implementation. This is exactly the point where Machine Learning starts drifting away from science towards art, but honestly, that\u2019s where the magic happens!\nMachine Learning is a very active research area and already there are several viable alternatives to XGBoost. Microsoft Research recently released LightGBM framework for gradient boosting that shows great potential. CatBoost developed by Yandex Technology has been delivering impressive bench-marking results. It is a matter of time when we have a better model framework that beats XGBoost in terms of prediction performance, flexibility, explanability, and pragmatism. However, until a time when a strong challenger comes along, XGBoost will continue to reign over the Machine Learning world!\nPlease leave me your comments below.

I do them as soon as I arrive at our JotForm headquarters. The process clears my head and leverages the crisp, uncluttered state of mind I have right after a workout. They also prompt my best creative thinking.\nBut lately, I\u2019ve been wondering whether I should take my practice analog \u2014 or at least do some writing by hand. Because, according to experts, handwriting provides a range of benefits, from boosting creativity to enhancing memory formation.\n\u201cThere\u2019s a myth that in the era of computers we don\u2019t need handwriting,\u201d says University of Washington professor Virginia Berninger.\nHandwriting is beneficial for adult brains, too, making it an analog activity worth holding onto (pun intended).\nAs our lives become increasingly digitized, it may be tricky to reintroduce handwriting, but using an old-fashioned paper planner is an easy way to start. You can reap the benefits of handwriting with the added bonus of organizing your life.\nTo help get you started, I\u2019m sharing some simple ways to kick off your planning habit. But first, an overview of what we can gain by going analog.\nDisclaimer: I\u2019m just as attached to my smartphone as the next person. But I often feel a pang of nostalgia when I go for a walk and see people of all ages glued to their screens. I long for the days before devices dominated our every waking hour. That\u2019s just one reason why I do a digital sabbath day on the weekend.\nUsing a paper planner can also provide a daily reprieve from devices. Without alerts, notifications, and tempting web browsers, we\u2019re less distracted and can focus better on the task at hand (again, pun intended).\n\u201c[W]riting by hand forces you to slow down and approach your planning with more mindfulness,\u201d says journalist and Get Money author Kristin Wong.\nIn a time when school curriculums are increasingly focused on keyboard proficiency, it turns out that handwriting positively impacts our learning ability.\nPsychologists have found that college students learn better when they take notes by hand rather than typing them, because handwriting forces students to process the lecture and reframe it, which can lead to better understanding and memory encoding.\nSo when we reflect on the day, week, or month, planning by hand may help us to better organize our thoughts and goals. Not to mention, we\u2019re more likely to remember those appointments.\nWriting by hand also boosts creativity, as shown by Professor Virginia Berninger\u2019s studies with children, who produced more ideas after composing text by hand as opposed to typing on a keyboard.\nOn a more practical note, many people prefer paper planners as a way to keep everything in one place, instead of bouncing from app to app. I\u2019m a big advocate of doing one thing at a time, so any habit that reduces multitasking is a step in the right direction.\nFast Company contributor Shane Snow writes that when he started using a weekly planner, \u201cit forced me to think about my priorities a whole week in advance (rather than just day by day), which made me schedule out those work blocks a little more intentionally.\u201d\nWith a finite amount of space within which to work, combined with the ability to visualize days and weeks ahead, you might find that using a planner helps you to prioritize.\nAn analog planner is a great way to kickstart to a writing routine. Or, if you already have a ritual (like morning pages) a planning habit is an easy, low-maintenance step to add. Not to mention, you can stop searching for the latest and greatest scheduling app.\nAs writer CM Smith shared with LifeHack:\nBut, as any seasoned planner will tell you, the physical options are endless. From simple calendars to customizable notebooks with inserts, there are so many products suited to a wide range of planning goals.\nI\u2019m all about making people\u2019s lives easier. In fact, that\u2019s why I started JotForm \u2014 a source for user-friendly online forms that meet a huge variety of customer needs.\nIf you\u2019re ready to put pen to paper, here are some guidelines to help you choose the best planner for you, based on your goals and interests.\nYou want: an organized methodology for planning your days, weeks, and months, with room to add journal notes.\nTry: Leuchtturm 1917 Bullet Journal\nThe details: Bullet journaling uses rapid logging \u2014 short, bulleted sentences with symbols to represent different categories (tasks, events, notes, etc.). The Bullet Journal even has a Companion App, so you can continue your planning streak even if you forget your journal.\nPro tip: Writes Ryder Carroll, creator of the Bullet Journal: \u201cI like to describe the Bullet Journal Method as an empty house. I gave the community this house to fill it with their own lives. That\u2019s the key, to furnish your space with the things that serve you.\u201d\nYou want: a versatile, customizable notebook for planning and journaling, with room to add some artistic flair.\nTry: TRAVELER\u2019s Notebook\nThe details: a traveler\u2019s notebook is a fully customizable notebook with a sturdy leather cover that looks better as it ages. You can add a monthly, weekly, or daily planner, and give it a personal touch with optional accessories.\nPro tip: If you\u2019re a scrapbooker, then you\u2019ll love flexing your crafty, creative muscles with this planner. Find inspiration using the hashtag: #midoritravelersnotebook\nYou want: a bare-bones, low commitment planner that you\u2019ll stick with, including just enough room to jot down appointments, deadlines, and a few notes.\nTry: Muji Note Book Monthly\nThe details: made with recycled paper, this minimalist monthly planner is slim, inexpensive, and functional \u2014 a beginner-friendly way to start analog planning. The calendar is unmarked, so you can fill in the months and dates as you go along.\nPro tip: if scheduling is your main goal, then this planner is your best bet.\nYou want: a place to flesh out short- and long-term goals, plus accountability to help you reach them.\nTry: Panda Planner\nThe details: this planner includes prompts to get you thinking about a variety of goal-related questions: daily priorities, habits and focuses; upcoming projects and steps; and distractions you hope to avoid.\nPro tip: studies show that writing down your goals makes them much more likely to happen. A Panda Planner commits your goals to paper, and the built-in prompts help you assess (and reassess) your goals and progress.\nYou want: an artistic way to plan\nTry: Action Agendas Coloring Planner\nThe details: a coloring planner provides space for organizing, plus coloring pages to add some creativity to your morning routine.\nPro tip: coloring has been shown to reduce anxiety, stress and depressive symptoms in adults. So sharpen those pencils and color away.\nI love finding new apps to increase my productivity. If I can spend less time on logistical activities and more time on meaningful work, then I consider that a \u2018win.\u2019\nThat said, I also embrace the idea of digital minimalism.\nAs Cal Newport, deep work expert and author of the New York Times bestseller Digital Minimalism, explains:\nWithout writing off the digital world entirely, using a paper planner is a great way to eliminate some of those low-value apps, while reaping the benefits of handwriting \u2014 not to mention mapping out your life in the process.\n", "claps": "1.2K claps", "author": "Aytekin Tank", "comments": [], "link": "https://medium.com/swlh/go-analog-the-benefits-of-paper-planners-a2ffa0755a4e"}, {"title": "TDD Changed My Life \u2013 JavaScript Scene \u2013 Medium", "num_comments": 39, "tags": ["technology", "software development", "javascript", "software engineering", "tdd"], "reading_time": 9, "text": "It\u2019s 7:15 am and customer support is swamped. We just got featured on Good Morning America, and a whole bunch of first time customers are bumping into bugs.\nIt\u2019s all-hands-on-deck. We\u2019re going to ship a hot fix NOW before the opportunity to convert more new users is gone. One of the developers has implemented a change he thinks will fix the issue. We paste the staging link in company chat and ask everybody to go test the fix before we push it live to production. It works!\nOur ops superhero fires up his deploy scripts, and minutes later, the change is live. Suddenly, customer support call volume doubles. Our hot-fix broke something else, and the developers erupt in synchronized git blame while the ops hero reverts the change.\nIt\u2019s been a while since I\u2019ve had to deal with that situation. Not because developers stopped making mistakes, but because for years now, every team I\u2019ve led and worked on has had a policy of using TDD. Bugs still happen, of course, but the release of show-stopping bugs to production has dropped to near zero, even though the rate of software change and upgrade maintenance burden has increased exponentially since then.\nWhenever somebody asks me why they should bother with TDD, I\u2019m reminded of this story \u2014 and dozens more like it. One of the primary reasons I switched to TDD is for improved test coverage, which leads to 40%-80% fewer bugs in production. This is my favorite benefit of TDD. It\u2019s like a giant weight lifting off your shoulders.\nOn my projects, our suites of automated unit and functional tests prevent disastrous breaking changes from happening on a near-daily basis. For example, I\u2019m currently looking at 10 automated library upgrades from the past week that I used to be paranoid about merging because what if it broke something?\nAll of those upgrades integrated automatically, and they\u2019re already live in production. I didn\u2019t look at a single one of them manually, and I\u2019m not worried at all about them. I didn\u2019t have to go hunting to come up with this example. I popped open GitHub, looked at recent merges, and there they were. What was once manual maintenance (or worse, neglect) is now automated background process. You could try that without good test coverage, but I wouldn\u2019t recommend it.\nTDD stands for Test Driven Development. The process is simple:\nOn the surface, it may seem that writing all those tests is a lot of extra code, and all that extra code takes extra time. At first, this was true for me, as I struggled to understand how to write testable code in the first place, and struggled to understand how to add tests to code that was already written.\nTDD has a learning curve, and while you\u2019re climbing that learning curve, it can and frequently does add 15% \u2014 35% to implementation times. But somewhere around the 2-years in mark, something magical started to happen: I started coding faster with unit tests than I ever did without them.\nSeveral years ago I was building a video clip range feature in a UI. The idea was that you\u2019d set a starting point and an ending point for a video, and when the user links to it, it would link to that precise clip rather than the whole video.\nBut it wasn\u2019t working. The player would reach the end of the clip and keep on playing, and I had no idea why.\nI kept thinking it had to do with the event listener not getting hooked up properly. My code look something like this:\nChange. Compile. Reload. Click. Wait. Repeat.\nEach change took almost a minute to test, and I tried a hilariously large number of things (most of them 2\u20133 times).\nDid I misspell timeupdate? Did I get the API right? Is the video.pause() call working? I\u2019d make a change, add a console.log(), jump back into the browser, hit refresh, click to a moment before the end of the clip, and then wait patiently for it to hit the end. Logging inside the if statement did nothing. OK, that\u2019s a clue. Copy and paste timeupdate from the API docs to be absolutely sure it wasn\u2019t a typo. Refresh, click, wait. No luck!\nFinally, I placed a console.log() outside the if statement. \u201cThis can\u2019t help,\u201d I thought. After all, that if statement was so simple, there\u2019s no way I could have screwed up the logic. It logged. I spit my coffee on the keyboard. WTF?!\nI set a breakpoint to figure out what was going on. I inspected the value of clip.stopTime. undefined??? I looked back at my code. When the user clicks to select the stop time, it places the little stop cursor icon, but never sets clip.stopTime. \u201cOMG I\u2019m a gigantic idiot and nobody should ever let me anywhere near a computer again for as long as I live.\u201d\nYears later I still remember this because of that feeling. You know exactly what I\u2019m talking about. We\u2019ve all been there. We\u2019re all living memes.\nIf I was writing that UI today, I\u2019d start with something like this:\nGranted, superficially, that looks like a whole lot more code than clip.stopTime = video.currentTime. But that\u2019s the point. This code acts like a specification. Documentation, along with proof that the code works as documented. And because it exists, if I change the way I position the stop time cursor on the x, y axis, I don\u2019t have to worry about whether or not I\u2019m breaking the clip stop time code in the process.\nThe point is not how long it takes to type this code. The point is how long it takes to debug it if something goes wrong. If this code broke, this test would give me a great bug report. I\u2019d know right away that the problem is not the event handler. I\u2019d know it\u2019s in setClipStopTime() or the clipReducer() which implements the state mutation. I\u2019d know what it\u2019s supposed to do, the actual output, and the expected output \u2014 and more importantly \u2014 so would a coworker, 6-months into the future who\u2019s trying to add features to the code I built.\nOne of the first things I do in every project is set up a watch script that automatically runs my unit tests on every file change. I often code with two monitors side-by-side and keep my dev console with the watch script running on one monitor while I code on the other. When I make a change, I usually know within 3 seconds whether or not that change worked.\nFor me, TDD is far more than a safety net. It\u2019s also constant, fast, realtime feedback. Instant gratification when I get it right. Instant, descriptive bug report when I get it wrong.\nI\u2019m going to admit something embarrassing: I had no idea how to build apps before I learned TDD with unit testing. How I ever got hired would be beyond me, but after interviewing hundreds and hundreds of developers, I can tell you with great confidence: there are a lot of developers in the same boat. TDD taught me almost everything I know about effective decoupling and composition of software components (meaning modules, functions, objects, UI components, etc.)\nThe reason for that is because unit tests force you to test components in isolation from each other, and from I/O. Given some input, the unit under test should produce some known output. If it doesn\u2019t, the test fails. If it does, it passes. The key is that it should do so independent of the rest of the application. If you\u2019re testing state logic, you should be able to test it without rendering anything to the screen or saving anything to a database. If you\u2019re testing UI rendering, you should be able to test it without loading the page in a browser or hitting the network.\nAmong other things, TDD taught me that life gets a lot simpler when you keep UI components as minimal as you can. Isolate business logic and side-effects from UI. In practical terms, that means that if you\u2019re using a component-based UI framework like React or Angular, it may be advantageous to create display components and container components, and keep them separate.\nFor display components, given some props, always render the same state. Those components can be easily unit tested to be sure that props are correctly wired up, and that any conditional logic in the UI layout works correctly (for example, maybe a list component shouldn\u2019t render at all if the list is empty, and it should instead render an invitation to add some things to the list).\nI knew about separation of concerns long before I learned TDD, but I didn\u2019t know how to separate concerns.\nUnit testing taught me about using mocks to test things, and then it taught me that mocking is a code smell, and that blew my mind and completely changed how I approach software composition.\nAll software development is composition: the process of breaking large problems down into lots of small, easy-to-solve problems, and then composing solutions to those problems to form the application. Mocking for the sake of unit tests is an indication that your atomic units of composition are not really atomic, and learning how to eradicate mocks without sacrificing test coverage taught me how to spot a myriad of sneaky sources of tight coupling.\nThat has made me a much better developer, and taught me how to write much simpler code that is easier to extend, maintain, and scale, both in complexity, and across large distributed systems like cloud infrastructure.\nI mentioned before that testing first leads to improved test coverage. The reason for that is that we don\u2019t start writing the implementation code until we\u2019ve written a test to ensure that it works. First, write the test. Then watch it fail. Then write the implementation code. Fail, pass, refactor, repeat.\nThat process builds a safety net that few bugs will slip through, and that safety net has a magical impact on the whole team. It eliminates fear of the merge button.\nThat reassuring coverage number gives your whole team the confidence to stop gatekeeping every little change to the codebase and let changes thrive.\nRemoving fear of change is like oiling a machine. If you don\u2019t do it, the machine grinds to a halt until you clean it up and crank it, squeaking and grinding back into motion.\nWithout that fear, the development cadence runs a lot smoother. Pull requests stop backing up. Your CI/CD is running your tests \u2014 it will halt if your tests fail. It will fail loudly, and point out what went wrong when it does.\nAnd that has made all the difference.\nTDD Day is an all-day live webinar Friday June 14, 2019, brought to you by DevAnywhere.io and Leanpub.\nYou\u2019ll learn:\nRegister now.\nEric Elliott is a distributed systems expert and author of the books, \u201cComposing Software\u201d and \u201cProgramming JavaScript Applications\u201d.

A Harvard graduate from a distinguished Silicon Valley family, she took over YouTube after successful stints at Intel and Google. A rare profile of her in the New York Times called her \u201cthe most measured person in tech.\u201d\nDorsey, Twitter\u2019s co-founder and CEO, is an unkempt idealist who throws himself into wellness trends, mindfulness retreats, and facial grooming experiments. An NYU dropout who once aspired to be a fashion designer, he helped start Twitter after he was rejected for a job at a shoe store. His onstage interview at the annual TED conference was only the latest in his ongoing tour of the media circuit.\nAlthough the CEOs are quite different, their recent media appearances revealed they are grappling with the same kinds of problems on their respective platforms \u2014 and taking a strikingly similar approach to addressing them. This approach could be charitably described as deliberate, even philosophical, and that deliberation stands in stark contrast to the breakneck speed at which the platforms were built, grew, and continue to operate.\nBoth Twitter and YouTube are rife with abuse, harassment, misinformation, manipulation, and every manner of extremism. One platform is stalked by armies of human trolls and bots lobbing death threats at scale. The other sucks users through wormholes to parallel realities where Earth is flat, vaccines cause autism, and radical ideologies are the cure for society\u2019s ills. Both struggled to contain the viral circulation of livestreams of the New Zealand massacre.\nNeither CEO is blind to this \u2014 not anymore, at least. The Times found Wojcicki reflecting on a staff meeting she called to address the appearance on YouTube of bestiality images alongside children\u2019s content. At TED, Dorsey sounded more like one of Twitter\u2019s many critics than the company\u2019s CEO: \u201cIt\u2019s a pretty terrible situation when you\u2019re coming to a service where ideally you want to learn something about the world, and you spend the majority of your time reporting abuse, receiving abuse, receiving harassment,\u201d he said.\nBoth executives acknowledged that they had failed to anticipate the severity of the problems their platforms would create as they grew. This explanation has started to feel more like an excuse in the tech world. No doubt it\u2019s true that the people who built the platforms that now dominate the global flow of information underestimated how their creations could be misused. But at this point, intentions are irrelevant. What matters is how they respond. And to judge by their recent words and their actions until now, Wojcicki and Dorsey are responding very slowly.\nIt\u2019s true that both companies have begun hiring more human reviewers and using machine learning to flag potential policy violations, with YouTube focusing more on problematic content and Twitter on patterns of user behavior. But neither has undertaken fundamental changes to their algorithm or the structure of the platform, and both have used freedom of speech as an excuse for inaction.\nThis timid approach seems to come from the top. A Bloomberg feature in April painted Wojcicki and her team as obsessed with growth and engagement metrics, even as YouTube\u2019s problems mounted. When her employees pressed her to address problematic content, Wojcicki reportedly demurred, saying it wasn\u2019t her job to decide what users could say or see. In the Times profile, Wojcicki took issue with that characterization, pointing to the sheer complexity of content moderation. \u201cIt\u2019s not like there is one lever we can pull and say, \u2018Hey, let\u2019s make all these changes,\u2019 and everything would be solved,\u201d she said. \u201cThat\u2019s not how it works.\u201d\nThe Times\u2019 Daisuke Wakabayashi sat in on a meeting in which Wojcicki and her deputies pondered \u2014 in painstaking depth \u2014 the proper response to a potentially dangerous video called the \u201cCondom Challenge.\u201d They ultimately decided not to remove it. While more sympathetic than Bloomberg\u2019s portrayal, the Times profile concluded that Wojcicki\u2019s \u201cdeliberate style may be at odds with the pace and scale of horrors and just plain stupidity that relentlessly arises on YouTube.\u201d\nThat will sound awfully familiar to anyone who has followed Dorsey\u2019s handling of Twitter\u2019s ongoing troubles with bots, neo-Nazis, and widespread harassment of women and people of color. While Dorsey has been admirably forthcoming about Twitter\u2019s shortcomings, he rarely matches his frank words with decisive actions. An official update on Twitter\u2019s progress toward its goals of healthier interactions showed mostly incremental improvements, such as a 16 percent decline in reports of abuse by users whom the victim doesn\u2019t follow. The company is justifiably proud of the fact that it is now proactively flagging 38 percent of the abusive content on which it takes action, but the bigger surprise is that the company was doing none of this work as recently as a year ago. Until 2018 \u2014 more than a decade after the company was founded and years after the scale of abuse it enabled had become clear \u2014 Twitter had put the entire burden of reporting on its users.\nA year ago, I praised Dorsey for \u201crethinking everything\u201d and admitting he didn\u2019t have all the answers at a time when Facebook was acting as though it did. That\u2019s the first step toward reshaping a platform around the understanding that algorithms will always be gamed, anonymity can shield the hateful, and not all engagement is good. I still believe Dorsey wants to build a better Twitter. To that end, the company has begun looking for healthier metrics to prioritize, and has rolled out a beta-test app called Twttr to test new ideas. So far, it has tested features such as Reddit-style reply threads, hiding replies that may be abusive or spammy, and making like counts and retweet counts less readily visible. At TED, Dorsey suggested that the entire concept of likes and follower counts may be incentivizing the wrong sorts of interactions.\nThe Times profile finds Wojcicki waxing similarly philosophical, albeit perhaps partly to counter her mercenary image, which began to take shape in Bloomberg\u2019s expose\u0301. \u201cOne way I think about some of the decisions is putting myself in the future and thinking: in five or 10 years, what will they say?\u201d Wojcicki said. \u201cIf someone were to look back on the decisions that we\u2019re making, would they feel we were on the right side of history? Would I feel proud? Will my children feel like I made good decisions?\u201d\nThese are the kinds of questions a reflective political leader might ask, and they underscore the sheer power these CEOs wield\u2014not always willingly. Taking action will help only if it\u2019s the right action, and caution is warranted when making changes to platforms this important \u2014 and not just to shareholders.\nBut posing the right questions now does not excuse the failure to ask them years ago, and it does not excuse these companies\u2019 ongoing inability to devise solutions proportional to the problems they\u2019ve created. It\u2019s hard to shake the sense that these companies and their leaders were far less risk-averse regarding features that might help them grow, make money, and demolish competitors than they are when it comes to making sure their creations don\u2019t ruin people\u2019s lives.\nTED\u2019s Chris Anderson kept pounding this point in his interview with Dorsey. Calling the CEO the \u201ccaptain of the Twittanic,\u201d Anderson told Dorsey, \u201cThere are people on board in steerage\u201d who are saying, \u201c\u2018We\u2019re worried about the iceberg ahead!\u2019 And you go, \u2018That is a powerful point\u2019 and \u2018Our ship frankly hasn\u2019t been built properly for steering as well as it might.\u2019 And we say \u2018Please do something!\u2019 And you go to the bridge, and we\u2019re waiting, and we look in, and you\u2019re showing this extraordinary calm \u2014 but we\u2019re all standing outside saying, \u2018Jack, turn the fucking wheel!\u2019\u201d\nOne explanation for why Dorsey and his counterparts have been reluctant to turn the wheel is that it\u2019s not obvious what alternate course they could chart, given the vessels they have built. Hate, bullying, violence, and extremism are endemic in social media, as they are in the real world, and it\u2019s probably impossible to eradicate them on a platform of YouTube or Twitter\u2019s scale. The hard question these companies face is how to contain them, and avoid exacerbating them, without destroying a business model that\u2019s premised on automation. The answer almost certainly involves forgoing some growth and profits and paying more humans to moderate content, which can be a tough sell to investors.\nPerhaps the deeper reason these leaders have been reluctant to make those sacrifices is that they don\u2019t actually see real-world harm as an iceberg. Facebook has livestreamed murders, suicides, and now a terrorist massacre, yet Mark Zuckerberg is still CEO and the company is posting record profits. The unintended consequences of these platforms\u2019 flaws may be fatal to others, but not to the companies or their leaders.\nFor tech companies and their CEOs, the real iceberg is stagnant user growth, declining revenues, shareholder panic. Confronted with Anderson\u2019s metaphor, Dorsey reminded the audience that when he took over the company, his first job was to steer it away from financial ruin and irrelevance. He succeeded because he didn\u2019t dither. He acted.\nIf Facebook\u2019s former unofficial motto of \u201cmove fast and break things\u201d summed up the blitzscaling mentality that gave rise to modern social media, with all its power and problems, it might make sense that the antidote would be to \u201cmove slowly and fix things.\u201d The problem is, the platforms are still breaking as rapidly as ever, and only the fixing is moving slowly.\n", "claps": "1.4K claps", "author": "Will Oremus", "comments": [], "link": "https://onezero.medium.com/tech-platforms-love-moving-fast-except-when-their-users-are-in-trouble-e8496c3a268"}, {"title": "Am I a \u201creal\u201d Software Engineer yet? \u2013 freeCodeCamp.org", "num_comments": 10, "tags": ["technology", "software development", "imposter syndrome", "web development", "programming"], "reading_time": 9, "text": "Am I a \u201creal\u201d Software Engineer yet?\nThis question has haunted me for years. And it seems I\u2019m not alone. Many people experience this same insecurity. They desire to know if they\u2019ve made it. Are they finally good enough?\nWhile \u201cSoftware Engineer\u201d is the standard title handed out by employers, many in the software community have different standards. And to new programmers joining the field, especially those without CS degrees, it can feel like the title is safe-guarded. Only bestowed on the select that have proven themselves.\nMany people refer to this sense of deficiency as Impostor Syndrome, though it goes by many names. Developers experience it in different ways and have differing reactions. To some, it can be crippling, but others might not notice it whatsoever.\nIn this article, I\u2019m going to recount my own ordeals with Impostor Syndrome. While I don\u2019t pretend to have a cure, I hope to shed some more light on the topic and help others who are dealing with it.\nNote: All the comments I\u2019ve shared are real comments I\u2019ve found on the internet. Not all of them were directed towards me, but I\u2019ve heard similar remarks. I\u2019m sure you have too.\nFor me, it started in July of 2016. I had started studying web development as a New Years Resolution. I wasn\u2019t satisfied with my career at the time and was looking for a change. A common origin story that I\u2019m sure many people can relate to.\nI focused on front-end development as I had heard that HTML, CSS and JavaScript were easy to pick up. I spent my evenings after work parsing through Treehouse, Lynda, and Codecademy tutorials. The first three months of 2016 passed by like this. By April, my notebook was full of thorough notes and my GitHub contained a few static sites. But I wasn\u2019t satisfied. I wanted to sink my teeth into a larger project.\nThat was when I decided to create a portfolio site for my wife, who was a product designer. For my skill level at the time, it wasn\u2019t an easy undertaking. I struggled a lot and it took the better part of four months to complete.\nIt\u2019s important to note that while working on my wife\u2019s website, I did my best to surround myself with tech culture. I watched YouTube videos, listened to podcasts, and read blog posts from experienced engineers to keep myself motivated. I daydreamed what it would be like to stand in their shoes. To have a job at a tech company, work on the latest technology, and write \u201cSoftware Engineer\u201d as my Occupation on tax forms. Silicon Valley made it all look so glorious.\nThat\u2019s why I couldn\u2019t have been happier when my wife\u2019s website went live in July of that year. I had done it. I had made my first real website that was going to receive real traffic. Could I finally start calling myself something of a Software Engineer?\nNot according to the Internet:\n\u201cWeb development isn\u2019t real programming\u201d, \u201cJavaScript isn\u2019t a real programming language\u201d, and \u201ca front-end developer isn\u2019t a Software Engineer\u201d were all phrases I heard often. While I was determined to change careers, I was also self-conscious. I couldn\u2019t shake the thought that the naysayers were right.\nIf I\u2019d had a Plan B or a stable career to fall back on, I might\u2019ve given up right then and there. Fortunately, I didn\u2019t. For better or worse, I had no other career or skills to fall back on and I had already invested too much time. So I trudged on, with the sunk cost keeping me afloat.\nI spent the next 18 months studying software development full time. I quit my job and moved in with my in-laws \u2014 which was a journey in-and-of itself. I put everything I had into my career move. I studied Ruby, Node, and some Go and built some small web apps.\nBy January of 2018, it had been two years since the start of my career switch and I had learned a great deal. I knew the fundamentals, I could program in multiple languages, and I had started contributing to open-source projects. I also had a decent portfolio to show for it. I was excited to finally call myself a Software Engineer.\n\u201cNot so fast,\u201d said the Internet.\nAt this point, I had dealt with many doubters. While it still didn\u2019t feel great to hear criticism, I had learned to ignore it for the most part. Furthermore, I had an Ace up my sleeve. There was one final step I could accomplish to put all the doubts to rest: Getting a job.\nYes, a software engineering job. The holy grail. I would have the title, the paycheck, and the acclaim. No more self-doubt. Only deserved validation from an employer.\nAnd that\u2019s what I did. I started interviewing in early 2018 and signed my first offer letter by March of 2018. My official role was \u201cSoftware Engineer\u201d. That was that, the hunt for acceptance was finally over.\nAt least that\u2019s what I thought. It seemed the gate-keeping extended even into the realm of employment. But it was over. I was a Software Engineer \u2014 I had the W4 papers to prove it. The moment I stepped into the office for my first day on the job, all my worries would disappear.\nBut that wasn\u2019t the truth. Who knew that adding obligations and deadlines would make one\u2019s insecurities worse, not better?\nMy anxiety hit a fever pitch the moment I arrived for first day of onboarding. Slack conversations I didn\u2019t understand. GitHub repositories with thousands of lines of code I didn\u2019t comprehend. Development tools I had never heard of or used. My first week on the job was a whirlwind of stress.\nDon\u2019t get my wrong, I was thrilled to be surrounded by such experienced engineers. My team was full of some of the smartest engineers I\u2019d ever met and they were incredibly understanding. They mentored me and ramped me up to speed. But it was still intimidating as hell.\nMany of my coworkers had advanced degrees, some had been programming since they were teens, and others were core maintainers of large open source projects. And who was I? Some guy who learned to code because it looked cool on TV. I felt out of place and the feeling didn\u2019t disappear.\nMy thoughts began to resemble the negative comments that I had worked so hard to prove wrong:\nHow the hell did I get here? Was it luck? Did someone make a mistake?\nI realized that I didn\u2019t need Reddit to point out my inadequacies \u2014 I was quite capable of that myself. It\u2019s true that, with time, I became more familiar with my environment. I began to understand the Slack conversations, the code became more familiar, and I learned how to use the various tools. And yet, I couldn\u2019t shake the feeling that I was a stranger in a foreign land. Every mistake I made only served to prove that point further.\nI anticipated the day that I made one mistake too many and someone finally asked, \u201cHow on Earth did you get hired?\u201d That fear consumed me. I began reading whitepapers, frequenting Hacker News, and taking classes to get a Computer Science degree. All in the hopes that I would finally feel like I fit in. That I was a \u201creal\u201d software engineer. But none of it worked.\nLuckily, I found something that did.\nThe solution that I found for myself was simple yet terrifying.\nTalking.\nI had to talk to someone. I couldn\u2019t keep it bottled anymore. However, I was too nervous to ask any of coworkers a question like, \u201cHave you ever felt like a fraud?\u201d Instead, I started with my close friends. But I soon found myself discussing the topic to anyone I could, including coworkers and teammates. Because the more I talked and listened, the more I realized I wasn\u2019t alone.\nAs it turns out, impostor syndrome is so common that it has become a cliche\u0301!\nMany professionals at the top of their careers experience it. Tina Fey, John Steinbeck, and even Albert Einstein. It was comforting to find out that I was in such good company. Furthermore, when talking with a close friend, he said something that struck a chord with me:\nIt was in that moment that I realized impostor syndrome wasn\u2019t something to fight or ignore. With the right mindset, it can be a tool. That may sound like some feel-good BS, but public speakers employ a similar trick to convert anxiety into excitement.\nThis isn\u2019t to say that my insecurities have magically disappeared. Far from it. Whenever I\u2019m given a new project to work on, my panic makes an unwelcome return. My heart rate spikes and my mind conjures up fantastical feats of failure. However, I\u2019ve learned to interpret this nervous energy as a sign that I\u2019m learning and pushing myself to new heights.\nWhen my manager gives me a complicated task, it means that they trust that I can get it done. I may need to ask for help, research the topic, or simply go for a walk to cool my nerves, but I know I\u2019ll get through it. I still make mistakes all the time and that will never change. It\u2019s all a part of the process.\nAfter all, no one knows everything, not even within their own specialty. Dan Abramov doesn\u2019t know flexbox and David Heinemeier Hansson still looks up ActiveRecord methods he wrote himself. If perfection was a feasible goal, Stack Overflow wouldn\u2019t be as popular as it is.\nSo after all this time, am I a \u201creal\u201d software engineer yet? LinkedIn seems to think so.\nThe better question is, \u201cDoes it matter?\u201d I haven\u2019t always been passionate about tech and I lack the enticing origin story of a Rockstar Engineer. But I\u2019m here now and I\u2019m here to stay. So to those in the tech community who have strong opinions about my title, call me whatever you want. A software engineer, programmer, script kiddie...\nMy title no longer matters to me. What matters is what I do. And what I do is use code to solve problems and architect solutions to make peoples\u2019 lives better.\nBest of all, I\u2019m damn good at it.\n", "claps": "1.2K claps", "author": "Sun-Li Beatteay", "comments": [], "link": "https://medium.freecodecamp.org/am-i-a-real-software-engineer-yet-a0f38a2248c0"}, {"title": "5 Advanced Features of Python and How to Use Them \u2013 Towards Data Science", "num_comments": 10, "tags": ["technology", "artificial intelligence", "innovation", "data science", "machine learning"], "reading_time": 4, "text": "Python is a beautiful language. Simple to use yet powerfully expressive. But are you using everything that it has to offer?\nThe advanced features of any programming language are usually discovered through extensive experience. You\u2019re coding up a complicated project and find yourself searching for something on stackoverflow. You then come across a beautifully elegant solution to your problem that uses a Python feature you never even knew existed!\nThat\u2019s totally the funnest way to learn: discovery by exploration and accident!\nHere are 5 of the most useful advanced features of the Python programming language \u2014 and more importantly how to use them!\nA Lambda Function is a small, anonymous function \u2014 anonymous in the sense that it doesn\u2019t actually have a name.\nPython functions are typically defined using the style of def a_function_name() , but with lambda functions we don\u2019t give it a name at all. We do this because the purpose of a lambda function is to perform some kind of simple expression or operation without the need for fully defining a function.\nA lambda function can take any number of arguments, but must always have only one expression:\nSee how easy that was! We performed a bit of basic math without the need for defining a full on function. This is one of the many features of Python that makes it a clean and simplistic programming language to use.\nMap() is a built-in Python function used to apply a function to a sequence of elements like a list or dictionary. It\u2019s a very clean and most importantly readable way to perform such an operation.\nCheck out the example above! We can apply our function to a single list or multiple lists. In face, you can use a map with any python function you can think of, as long as it\u2019s compatible with the sequence elements you are operating on.\nThe Filter built-in function is quite similar to the Map function in that it applies a function to a sequence (list, tuple, dictionary). The key difference is that filter() will only return the elements which the applied function returned as True.\nCheck out the example below for an illustration:\nNot only did we evaluate True or False for each list element, the filter() function also made sure to only return the elements which matched as True. Very convenient for handling to two steps of checking an expression and building a return list.\nThe Python Itertools module is a collection of tools for handling iterators. An iterator is a data type that can be used in a for loop including lists, tuples, and dictionaries.\nUsing the functions in the Itertools module will allow you to perform many iterator operations that would normally require multi-line functions and complicated list comprehension. Check out the examples below for an awesome illustration of the magic of Itertools!\nGenerator functions allow you to declare a function that behaves like an iterator, i.e. it can be used in a for loop. This greatly simplifies your code and is much more memory efficient than a simple for loop.\nConsider an example where we want to add up all of the numbers from 1 to 1000. The first part of the code below illustrates how you would do this using a for loop.\nNow that\u2019s all fine and dandy if the list is small, say a length of 1000. The problem arises when you want to do this with a huge list, say 1 billion float numbers. With a for loop, that massive memory chewing list is created in memory \u2014 not everyone has unlimited RAM to store such a thing! The range() function in Python does the same thing, it builds the list in memory\nSection (2) of the code illustrates the summing of the list of numbers using a Python generator. A generator will create elements and store them in memory only as it needs them i.e one at a time. That means, if you have to create 1 billion floating point numbers, you\u2019ll only be storing them in memory one at a time! The xrange() function in Python uses generators to build lists.\nMoral of the story: If you have a large range that you\u2019d like to generate a list for, use a generator or the xrange function. This is especially true if you have a really memory sensitive system such as mobile or at-the-edge computing.\nThat being said, if you\u2019d like to iterate over the list multiple times and it\u2019s small enough to fit into memory, it will be better to use for loops and the range function. This is because generators and xrange will be freshly generating the list values every time you access them, whereas range is a static list and the integers already exist in memory for quick access.\nFollow me on twitter where I post all about the latest and greatest AI, Technology, and Science!

The way we develop our APIs must evolve with time so that we can always build good, intuitive and well-designed APIs.\nIn the last few years, GraphQL has been growing in popularity among developers. A lot of companies have started adopting this technology to build their APIs. GraphQL is a query language developed by Facebook in 2012 and released publicly in 2015. It has been gaining a lot of traction. It has been adopted by a lot of big companies such as Spotify, Facebook, GitHub, NYTimes, Netflix, Walmart, and so on.\nIn this series of tutorials, we\u2019re going to examine GraphQL, understand what it is, and see what features make this query language so intuitive and easy to use.\nSo, let\u2019s get started by examining the problems with REST, and how GraphQL solves them. We will also find out why companies have been building their APIs with GraphQL, and why it is the future of APIs.\nA long time ago, when we changed our API design from SOAP to REST, we thought that move would give developers more flexibility in their work. We can\u2019t deny that it worked pretty well for some time and was a good move at the time. As the applications and the web have been getting more and more sophisticated, the APIs naturally evolved as well, following these changes.\nHowever, REST does have a lot of problems. Let\u2019s see what they are:\nEach resource in REST is represented by an endpoint. So, in a real-world application, we would end up having a lot of endpoints for a lot of resources. If you want to make a GET request, you would need an endpoint specific to that request, with specific parameters. If you want to make a POST request, you would need another endpoint just for that request.\nBut, what\u2019s the problem with that? Let\u2019s imagine we are building a huge social media application like Facebook. We will end up with a lot of endpoints which means more developer time is going to be spent developing and maintaining these APIs.\nA real problem that annoys a lot of developers is over-fetching and under-fetching information through REST APIs. This is because REST APIs always return a fixed structure. We can\u2019t get exactly the data that we want unless we create a specific endpoint for that.\nSo, if we need only a tiny piece of data, we have to work with the whole object. For example, if we only need to get the firstName, lastName, and age of a user in a REST API, there's no way we can get exactly this data without fetching the whole object.\nThere\u2019s also a problem with under-fetching of information. If we want to get data from two different resources, we need to make different calls to two different endpoints. In a huge application, this doesn\u2019t scale so well since there will be cases where we only need to get a specific piece of data, not the entire object. Now, imagine we\u2019re building an application that\u2019s going to have 100 endpoints. Imagine the amount of work and code that we need to write. This will become more difficult with time. The code also gets hard to maintain, and developers feel lost in the process.\nOne of the painful points in REST, in my opinion, is versioning. With REST APIs, it is very common to see a lot of APIs with v1 or v2. In GraphQL there\u2019s no need for it since you can evolve your APIs by adding new types or removing old ones.\nIn GraphQL, all you need to do to evolve your API is to write new code. You can write new types, queries, and mutations without the need to ship another version of your API.\nSo, you won\u2019t see GraphQL APIs with endpoints like the following:\nBack in 2012, Facebook faced a problem while they were developing their mobile applications which led them to create GraphQL. Those problems are very common, especially when we\u2019re talking about RESTful API design. As discussed these problems are:\nWith a lot of concepts in mind, developers from Facebook developed a better way to design APIs and later named it GraphQL. Basically, it\u2019s the replacement for REST, with a lot of improvements.\nWith GraphQL, we get a lot of new features that give you superpowers when you are building your APIs. Let\u2019s examine them one by one:\nThere\u2019s no need to build a lot of endpoints! With GraphQL, we only get one endpoint, and with that, we can get as much data as we want in a single request. Basically, GraphQL wraps all of your queries, mutations, and subscriptions in one endpoint and makes it available to you. It improves your development cycle because you don\u2019t need to make two requests to get data from two different resources. Also, imagine that we\u2019re building a huge application, we won\u2019t get a lot of endpoints and a ton of code as with REST. We will get a single endpoint, and with that endpoint, we can make as many requests as we want.\nAlso, as I said above, an \u201cendpoint-only\u201d approach makes your API self-documented since there\u2019s no need for you to build documentation because your developers already know how to use it. They can understand the API just by looking at the code, or by looking at the playground. We\u2019re going to learn more about it later on (next tutorial in this series). Seems magical, but it is just GraphQL!\nNo more over-fetching or under-fetching of information. You fetch only the data that you need. Remember the poor performance issues that we discussed initially? We don\u2019t have that anymore since GraphQL improves the performance of your API, especially in case of slow network connection.\nA lot of people think that GraphQL is pretty complicated because it involves a schema and a single endpoint. Once you start developing APIs with it, you discover that it\u2019s easier than you thought. An \u201cendpoint-only\u201d API helps a lot when you\u2019re developing your website/app. It makes your API more self-documented, and there\u2019s no need for you to write a lot of documentation about it.\nIf you don\u2019t use JavaScript as your main language, that\u2019s not a problem. GraphQL is an agnostic query language which means you can use it with any language. At the time of writing this tutorial, GraphQL has support for more than 12 languages.\nThe fact that GraphQL is an open source query language means that the community can contribute to it and make improvements to it. When Facebook released it to the community, it gained a lot of traction and approval from developers. Now, GraphQL has been growing rapidly as more and more developers are starting to build APIs with it. However, some people have been asking if this is really going to replace REST or become the new way to build APIs for real-world applications.\nAt first, I thought that GraphQL was only hype and just another way to create APIs. However, when I started to study it, I found out that GraphQL has the essential features that are required to create modern APIs for modern applications because it really plays well with modern stacks.\nSo if I could say something to you now is: yes, GraphQL is really the future of APIs. That\u2019s why big companies are betting on it.\nIn November 2018, GraphQL created a GraphQL Foundation, in partnership with the Linux Foundation. This query language is encouraging its developers to build more documentation, tools, and support for the language. This foundation will ensure a stable, neutral, and sustainable future for GraphQL. So, this is another reason to consider GraphQL to be the future of APIs.\nOf course, it won\u2019t replace REST immediately because many apps still use it and it\u2019s impossible to rewrite them overnight. As more and more companies adopt GraphQL, both UX and DX will improve.\nGraphQL is really the future of APIs, and we need to learn more about it. That\u2019s why I decided to create a series of 4 tutorials that will show how we can work with the best of GraphQL, starting from Queries and Mutations, then Subscriptions, and Authentication.\nIn the next tutorial of this series, I\u2019m going to dive deep into GraphQL, show how GraphQL works with types, and create our first Queries and Mutations.\nSo, stay tuned and see you in the next tutorial!\n\ud83d\udc26 Follow me on Twitter!\nThis article was originally posted at Hashnode.

Your task is to draw seven colored circles in a row and based on a timer change the intensity of each circle. When a circle is brightened its predecessor returns to its normal intensity.\nThis simulates the effect of a string of rippling lights, similar to the ones displayed during the Christmas Holidays.\nTier: 1 \u2014 Beginner\nDescription: It\u2019s important for Web Developers to understand the basics of manipulating images since rich web applications rely on images to add value to the user interface and user experience (UI/UX).\nFlipImage explores one aspect of image manipulation \u2014 image rotation. This app displays a square panel containing a single image presented in a 2x2 matrix. Using a set of up, down, left, and right arrows adjacent to each of the images the user may flip them vertically or horizontally.\nYou must only use native HTML, CSS, and Javascript to implement this app. Image packages and libraries are not allowed.\nTier: 1 \u2014 Beginner\nDescription: Practice and test your knowledge by answering questions in a quiz application.\nAs a developer, you can create a quiz application for testing coding skills of other developers. (HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Python, PHP, etc...)\nQuiz app built with React (wait for it to load as it is hosted on Heroku)\nTier: 1 \u2014 Beginner\nDescription: The numeric system represented by Roman numerals originated in ancient Rome and remained the usual way of writing numbers throughout Europe well into the Late Middle Ages. Roman numerals, as used today, employ seven symbols, each with a fixed integer value.\nSee the below table the Symbol \u2014 Value pairs:\nRoman Number Converter\nTier: 2 \u2014 Intermediate\nDescription: Create an application that will allow users to search for books by entering a query (Title, Author, etc). Display the resulting books in a list on the page with all the corresponding data.\nYou can use the Google Books API\nBookSearch-React\nTier: 2 \u2014 Intermediate\nDescription: Card memory is a game where you have to click on a card to see what image is underneath it and try to find the matching image underneath the other cards.\nWhen the User clicks on the 2nd card:\nFlip \u2014 card memory game\nSMB3 Memory Card Game\nTier: 2 \u2014 Intermediate\nDescription: Create an application that will convert a regular table with data provided by the User (optionally) into a Markdown formatted table.\nTables Generator / Markdown Tables\nTier: 2 \u2014 Intermediate\nDescription: The purpose of String Art is to provide the developer with practice creating a simple animated graphic, using geometry in the animation algorithm, and creating something that\u2019s visually pleasant to watch.\nString Art draws a single multicolored line which smoothly moves until one end touches a side of the enclosing window. At the point, it touches a \u201cbounce\u201d effect is applied to change its direction.\nA ripple effect is created by only retaining 10\u201320 images of the line as it moves. Older images are progressively faded until they disappear.\nAnimation libraries are not allowed.

This is a type of architectural pattern that useful in many application since it allows any number of apps to utilize the same service.\nThe BGE itself is invoked through a series of function calls rather than through directly coupled end-user actions. In this respect using the BGE is similar to using an API or a series of routes exposed by a web server.\nThis challenge requires that you develop the BGE and a very thin, text-based presentation layer for testing that\u2019s separate from the engine itself. Due to this, the User Stories below are divided two sets \u2014 one for the BGE and one for the text-based presentation layer.\nBGE is responsible for maintaining the game state.\nstartGame() will randomly place these ships on the board in any direction and will return an array representing ship placement.\nCells in the hits and misses array will contain a space if they have yet to be targeted, O if they were targeted but no part of a ship was at that location, or Xif the cell was occupied by part of a ship.\nshoot() will accept the player number the shot is being made for along with the coordinates of the shot. The data it returns will be for that player.\nThis YouTube video shows how a text-based Battleship Game is played.\nThe following example is provided as a demonstration of the Battleship game if it is unfamiliar to you. Remember you are to implement a text-based presentation layer for testing.

Real-time functionality can be added later (the bonus features).\nChatty2\nTier: 3 \u2014 Advanced\nDescription: API\u2019s and graphical representation of information are hallmarks of modern web applications. GitHub Timeline combines the two to create a visual history of a users GitHub activity.\nThe goal of GitHub Timeline is to accept a GitHub user name and produce a timeline containing each repo and annotated with the repo names, the date they were created, and their descriptions. The timeline should be one that could be shared with a prospective employer. It should be easy to read and make effective use of color and typography.\nOnly public GitHub repos should be displayed.\nGitHub offers two API\u2019s you may use to access repo data. You may also choose to use an NPM package to access the GitHub API.\nDocumentation for the GitHub API can be found at:\nSample code showing how to use the GitHub API\u2019s are:\nYou can use this CURL command to see the JSON returned by the V3 REST API for your repos:\nTier: 3 \u2014 Advanced\nDescription: Knowing how to spell is a fundamental part of being fluent in any language. Whether you are a youngster learning how to spell or an individual learning a new language being able to practice helps to solidify your language skills.\nThe Spell-It app helps users practice their spelling by playing the audio recording of a word the user must then spell using the computer keyboard.\nWord Wizard for iOS\nSpeak N Spell on Google Play\nTier: 3 \u2014 Advanced\nDescription: Surveys are a valuable part of any developers toolbox. They are useful for getting feedback from your users on a variety of topics including application satisfaction, requirements, upcoming needs, issues, priorities, and just plain aggravations to name a few.\nThe Survey app gives you the opportunity to learn by developing a full-featured app that will you can add to your toolbox. It provides the ability to define a survey, allow users to respond within a predefined timeframe, and tabulate and present results.\nUsers of this app are divided into two distinct roles, each having different requirements:\nCommercial survey tools include distribution functionality that mass emails surveys to Survey Respondents. For simplicity, this app assumes that surveys open for responses will be accessed from the app\u2019s web page.\nLibraries for building surveys: SurveyJS\nSome commercial survey services include: Survey Monkey and Typeform\nYou are welcome to contribute to the project in the GitHub repository!

But how are they different and why use one over the other?\nNote: Examples are given in JavaScript. Your Mileage May Vary with other languages.\nWhen you create a function with a name, that is a function declaration. The name may be omitted in function expressions, making that function \u201canonymous\u201d.\nFunction declaration:\nFunction expression:\nWe often see anonymous functions used with ES6 syntax like so:\nHoisting refers to the availability of functions and variables \u201cat the top\u201d of your code, as opposed to only after they are created. The objects are initialized at compile time and available anywhere in your file.\nFunction declarations are hoisted but function expressions are not.\nIt\u2019s easy to understand with an example:\nThe above does not throw an error, but this would:\nIt might seem like function declarations, with their powerful hoisting properties, are going to edge out function expressions for usefulness. But choosing one over the other requires thinking about when and where the function is needed. Basically, who needs to know about it?\nFunction expressions are invoked to avoid polluting the global scope. Instead of your program being aware of many different functions, when you keep them anonymous, they are used and forgotten immediately.\nThe name \u2014 immediately invoked function expressions \u2014 pretty much says it all here. When a function is created at the same time it is called, you can use an IIFE, which looks like this:\nor:\nFor an in-depth look at IIFEs, check out this comprehensive article.\nA function passed to another function is often referred to as a \u201ccallback\u201d in JavaScript. Here\u2019s an example:\nThe problem here is that mapAction will be available to your entire application \u2014 there\u2019s no need for that. If that callback is a function expression, it will not be available outside of the function that uses it:\nor\nthough mapAction will be available to code below its initialization.\nIn short, use function declarations when you want to create a function on the global scope and make it available throughout your code. Use function expressions to limit where the function is available, keep your global scope light, and maintain clean syntax.\nThere are so many phrases that get thrown around at tech meetups and conferences, assuming that everyone is already down with the lingo. I\u2019m often not down with the lingo. It\u2019s common for developers to act astonished that I lack a piece of knowledge.\nThe truth is, I often just don\u2019t know the right word for it. As humans, but especially developer humans, we love to dismiss those who don\u2019t \u201ctalk the talk\u201d, so this series is about getting a solid understanding of programming concepts that one \u201cshould know\u201d.\nThis is the second article in the series.

I didn\u2019t know it was a perianal abscess at first. I coughed while walking home from work and suddenly, there it was. I thought I\u2019d pulled something.\nY knew something was wrong when I called out of work the next day.\n\u201cAre you sick?\u201d she asked.\n\u201cMhm, yeah.\u201d\n\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d\n\u201cOh...you know.\u201d\nShe frowned.\nI couldn\u2019t bring myself to tell her. It seemed my fear of farting in front of her extended to talking about that dirty place where they come from. I blame my father. It is not that he told me not to fart or talk about butts in front of women, it is just that he never did and so I must have learned it through osmosis.\nSo, I told Y, \u201cIt\u2019s just a bad cold.\u201d\nAnd I coughed.\nThe pressure grew fast and hot like a temper and started to hurt. I knew I should see a doctor, but I didn\u2019t speak Russian well enough.\nI turned to my brother for advice.\n\u201cDo you fart in front of your girlfriend?\u201d I asked him.\n\u201cIn bed?\u201d\nI frowned.\nHe asked, \u201cWait, do you not fart in front of Y?\u201d\nI shrugged.\n\u201cDude, you\u2019re thirty!\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m twenty-nine!\u201d I protested. \u201cIt\u2019s just that after you fart in front of someone, there is no mystery left \u2014 you know?\u201d\n\u201cYou think your farts are a mystery?\u201d\n\u201cNever mind \u2014 it\u2019s just weird, I can\u2019t do it.\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s natural. You need to tell her. And you need to go to the doctor!\u201d\nHe added the last bit as I coughed and then screamed as tension shot through my body, igniting the pain in my rump. I found Y on her computer in the bedroom and confessed. I crawled up into bed with her like a wounded puppy and looked out of the window.\n\u201cMy butt hurts,\u201d I admitted.\n\u201cOh?\u201d\n\u201cAnd I am sorry, but I feel like I \u2014 well, sometimes I need to fart.\u201d\nShe looked at me like as I\u2019d imagine one looks upon an orphan wandering around the aftermath of a flood.\n\u201cI think you need a doctor.\u201d\nAnd so, we went. Doctors have a policy in Russia about a patient\u2019s dignity in front of loved ones.\nThat policy is: they don\u2019t give a fuck.\nPrivacy curtains stood abandoned in the corner of rooms as day after day, doctor after doctor played the game of I-could-have-sworn-I-left-my-keys-around-here-somewhere inside my butt, in front of Y. I felt like someone afraid of heights, 3000 feet in the air, in an airplane made of glass.\nAt one point, while one doctor had a glass tube pushed five-inches deep inside of me, I turned to look at Y and thought, is this how you see me now? And I tried to turn my head to look up at the doctor for sympathy, but he cried,\nThey eventually sent me to a military hospital, put me up on a table and sliced me open \u2014 it was excruciating; if an orgasm can make you see god, I was looking up the devil\u2019s nose.\nAfter it was over, Y led me, limping, to the doctor\u2019s office. He spoke English better than most doctors I\u2019d seen. He looked from Y to me.\n\u201cMaybe you should wait outside,\u201d he told her.\nShe gave me a warm smile and stood up.\n\u201cNo,\u201d I said. I took her hand, \u201cShe can stay, she knows everything now.\u201d\nThe doctor gave us both a grim nod and said, \u201cWell, with your condition, if you don\u2019t make some serious lifestyle changes, it could come back.\u201d\nI squirmed at the thought of reliving the last two weeks. \u201cWhat do I need to do?\u201d\nHe gave me a stern look. \u201cYou need to stop holding in your farts.\u201d\n\u201cWhat?\u201d\n\u201cYes \u2014 well, you see your condition is very common in men in their late twenties who grew up in predominantly male households \u2014 I had sisters myself. Here, let me show you.\u201d\nThe doctor turned a form over on his clipboard and began to draw. He held it up and showed us a picture of what looked like two cows waiting to cross either side of a busy road.\nHe pointed as he spoke, \u201cYou see, when you hold it in, these two muscles clench, cutting blood off from the phalingera, and when that happens enough, this little guy here splits which creates a cavity for a growth to form.\u201d\nY looked at the chart and back at me. \u201cIs there a way to help the smell?\u201d she asked finally.\n\u201cDiet,\u201d the doctor said. \u201cAlways diet. Maybe some candles.\u201d\nI tried to keep my face calm, but it was a struggle.\n\u201cStop that,\u201d the doctor said.\n\u201cStop what?\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2019re holding it in.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m not!\u201d I turned to Y, she patted me on the shoulder. \u201cIt\u2019s okay babe,\u201d she said.\n\u201cI swear! I\u2019m not. I\u2019m just in pain!\u201d\nThe doctor shrugged and turned to Y. He switched to Russian, but I understood enough. He said, \u201cGive him lots of compliments, he\u2019s a fragile one.\u201d\nY helped me get home. I laid in bed with an ice pack beneath me as Y laid beside me and read. I turned to her.\n\u201cAm I still sexy?\u201d\nShe kissed me.\n\u201cSo sexy.\u201d\nI began to drift off, but before I did, I said, \u201cYou can fart in front of me now too you know?\u201d\nShe gave me a disgusted look and said,\n\u201cDon\u2019t be gross.\u201d\nThank you for reading.

A quiet basement place run by an old guy who liked jazz and drank whiskey.\nHiroki said her watercolor paintings expressed a feeling he didn\u2019t have words for. Something like a blend of nostalgia, tragedy, and hope, as portrayed by gentle, flowing arcs of color.\nHe said she painted pictures like nothing he\u2019d ever seen.\nHer name was Toshiko.\nHiroki met Toshiko by chance, after accidentally falling down the stairs that led to the bar. He pushed open the old wooden door, took a seat by the counter, and ordered a whiskey.\nThe girl next to him sipped from a gin-tonic, and watched Hiroki\u2019s glass as it filled. It looked as though the act reminded her of something \u2014 like it was part of a long distant memory.\nWhen she noticed Hiroki, the girl stared at him a moment, her head tilted. Later she told him the sensation was like noticing something new in an old photograph.\n\u201cWhen I first saw her,\u201d Hiroki said, \u201cI just felt like I had to talk to her. Like I had to say something.\u201d\n\u201cSo what did you say?\u201d I asked.\n\u201cI said, \u2018Uh... have we met?\u2019\u201d\nI laughed.\n\u201cYou\u2019re an idiot.\u201d\n\u201cMaybe,\u201d he said. \u201cBut being stupid enough to fall down those stairs was the whole reason we met.\u201d\nHiroki talked about Toshiko often.\nHe organized small exhibitions in places like Koenji and Shimokitazawa, got her interviews in local magazines, and had her featured on the occasional website. He wanted people to see her work \u2014 to feel it and to swim in it, just like he did.\nToshiko went along with it, but she wasn\u2019t really interested in exhibitions, interviews, or websites.\nShe just wanted to paint.\n\u201cBut I don\u2019t fret the small stuff,\u201d Hiroki said. \u201cIf she keeps making art, the rest will work itself out.\u201d\n\u201cShe\u2019s that good?\u201d\nHe nodded.\n\u201cShe\u2019s that good.\u201d\nTo hear Hiroki talk about Toshiko was to hear the words of a man who was young, passionate, and in love.\nAt the time, I felt like none of those things. And yet, I believed him when he spoke.\nOr perhaps I simply wanted to.\nSome time soon after, Hiroki disappeared.\nOne day I realized I couldn\u2019t get in touch with him. He didn\u2019t answer his phone or reply to my messages. He didn\u2019t do social media. We didn\u2019t have mutual friends. I didn\u2019t know where he worked.\nAll I knew was where he lived.\nSo a week after Hiroki disappeared, I went to his apartment in Kichijoji.\nHiroki\u2019s apartment was one of four single-room apartments in a quiet old building some twenty minutes walk from the station.\nThe door was unlocked, but Hiroki wasn\u2019t home.\nInside, I found a suit jacket draped over a chair, an acoustic guitar in the corner, and a small table that played home to a few issues of Weekly Shonen Jump and a rice cooker. The mattress on the floor was an unmade bed covered in recently washed laundry. Perhaps he\u2019d meant to fold it later.\nI sat down in the chair. The air felt stale and old.\nIt didn\u2019t look like Hiroki had run away.\nIt looked like he\u2019d simply gone out and not come back.\nOn the small stool next to Hiroki\u2019s bed I found a box of matches, and next to it, a watercolor painting.\nIt was a painting of a house in the countryside. It reminded me of Nagasaki, and of home. I thought of a girl I wanted to talk to but never did, and long walks with a friend I thought I would grow old with. I thought of coming home to an angry father, and meals cobbled together between pauses in arguments.\nI looked at that painting for a long, long time.\nThe box of matches was from a bar; the address on the side for a basement place, somewhere in Shinjuku.\nThat night, I found myself at the bottom of a flight of stairs, standing in front of an old wooden door.\nI pushed open the door, took a seat by the counter, and ordered a whiskey.\nThe girl next to me sipped from a gin-tonic, and watched my glass as it filled. It looked as though the act reminded her of something \u2014 like it was part of a long distant memory.\nWhen she noticed me, the girl stared at my face for a moment, her head tilted. It was like noticing something new in an old photograph.\n\u201cUh... have we met?\u201d I asked.\nShe laughed.\nShe said her name was Toshiko.\nWe talked about music, and drinks, and life in general. We rode a conversation down a river of whiskey and gin tonics, and let silences fill with the talk of others \u2014 old men with their books, old women with their heartbreak \u2014 until it was just the two of us and a lonely piano, sifting its way through a mist of cigarette smoke and hazy memories.\nWhen I asked about Hiroki, Toshiko shook her head.\n\u201cIt\u2019s like he vanished,\u201d she said, \u201cand now I can\u2019t paint.\u201d\nThe comment felt heavy, like an anchor for emotions hidden in the darkness. I wanted to ask more \u2014 to understand \u2014 but before I could, Toshiko finished her drink, and she left.\nI sat by myself for a time, alone with a half-finished glass of whiskey, and The Bill Evans Trio playing Waltz for Debby.\n\u201cShe grew up in Ibaraki,\u201d the bartender said. \u201cShe moved here to study painting.\u201d\n\u201cOh?\u201d\nHe nodded.\n\u201cBut her talent is her curse. Her skills aren\u2019t appreciated in the country, but her heart can\u2019t settle in the city. She\u2019s trapped between who she is and where she\u2019s going.\u201d\nThe bartender said Toshiko couldn\u2019t get used to studying her art. She didn\u2019t want to analyze or understand it, and she didn\u2019t want others to dig into it for deeper meaning. She was most comfortable lost in the act of creation; lost in the act of capturing people and their lives in splashes of blended color.\nThese days, he said, Toshiko worked part-time at a convenience store in Higashi-Nakano, and painted in her free time.\n\u201cShe\u2019s a regular here,\u201d the bartender said. \u201cAnother soul in search of a home.\u201d\nThe bartender\u2019s words echoed in my head.\nHis bar struck me as a gathering place for the lonely and the lost \u2014 where nostalgia hung in the air with the smoke and the music. It was a world of grey, but that was the comfort of it \u2014 a shared sense of despair.\nBy contrast, Toshiko brought to mind gentle, flowing arcs of color, thrown against paper \u2014 rambling and aimless, but beautiful, too.\nHopeful.\nI spent my mornings reading at Hiroki\u2019s apartment, and my nights talking at the bar.\nWith Toshiko I talked about music, art, and living as a shadow in a city of a million faces.\nAnd with the bartender, I talked about Toshiko.\n\u201cShe doesn\u2019t like the taste of whiskey,\u201d he said, \u201cand she never drinks it. But something about it makes her happy.\u201d\nI\u2019d noticed it, too. It was a look in her eyes when she saw it; a sliver in time where she saw something the rest of us didn\u2019t.\n\u201cDo you know why?\u201d\nThe bartender shook his head.\n\u201cI don\u2019t.\u201d\n\u201cYou know, I don\u2019t even like whiskey,\u201d I said. \u201cI ordered it the first time because it felt right, but when I saw the way she looked at it, I couldn\u2019t order anything else. I still can\u2019t.\u201d\nThe bartender nodded.\n\u201cI know,\u201d he said.\nOne night, I asked Toshiko why she painted.\n\u201cSometimes,\u201d she said, \u201cwhen I\u2019m out, I see things in people and places. Something like an essence, or a spirit, or a feeling. I don\u2019t quite have the words for it. The closest I ever get to it is when I paint.\u201d\n\u201cYou told Hiroki the same thing, didn\u2019t you?\u201d\nShe paused for a moment.\n\u201cHow did you know?\u201d\n\u201cBecause that\u2019s why he fell in love with you,\u201d I said.\nAnd I realized in that moment, it was why I had, too.\nIn Toshiko was something I always wanted; a simple, beautiful, purity of expression.\nI felt it when she talked about her work, and how it suddenly felt lost to her. I felt it the first time I\u2019d seen it, standing in an empty apartment staring at a painting of a house in the countryside, wondering where my friend had gone.\nI imagined Hiroki had felt that, too.\n\u201cHow did you start painting?\u201d I asked.\nToshiko thought a moment. She glanced at my glass of whiskey. She looked like a little girl standing before a door with a very old key in her hand.\n\u201cMy father gave it to me,\u201d she said. \u201cHe gave me my very first watercolor set. It was cheap \u2014 probably something from a local 100-yen store \u2014 but it was the start of everything.\u201d\nShe said she didn\u2019t remember there being a reason for it. She thought maybe it was a spur of the moment thing.\n\u201cI don\u2019t remember much of my father,\u201d she said, \u201cbut I still remember his smile that day, and the sound of his laugh when he heard my own.\u201d\nI watched the shadows play across her face.\n\u201cI remember I hugged him,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd he smelled of whiskey.\u201d\nWhiskey was woven into the fabric of Toshiko\u2019s childhood memories.\nIt was why she loved the scent of it.\nBut it was woven into other memories, too. Memories of broken lives and broken marriages. Of broken promises and broken homes. Broken hearts.\nIt was was why she refused to drink it.\n\u201cPeople say whiskey is a complicated drink,\u201d Toshiko said. \u201cBut for me, it\u2019s a very simple drink \u2014 it just happens to be mixed with a lot of complicated feelings.\u201d\nThe following night, she gave me a package.\n\u201cWhat\u2019s this?\u201d I asked.\n\u201cIt\u2019s a painting. I wanted to give it to Hiroki, but I think it\u2019s better if you take it now.\u201d\n\u201cYou can paint again?\u201d\nShe nodded. \u201cSince last night,\u201d she said.\n\u201cWhy don\u2019t you give it to him yourself? When he gets back?\u201d\nShe shook her head.\n\u201cIt\u2019s not for him anymore.\u201d\nThe painting was of two boys sitting on a park bench; one of them in color, the other in black and white. They were wrapped in winter coats and thick scarves, marveling at a light winter snow.\nIn the bottom-right corner, Toshiko had written the date and a title.\n\u201cH & H\u201d\nI looked at that painting for a long, long time.\nThe next day, I found out Hiroki had died. His landlord told me when I tried to visit his apartment again.\nHe said Hiroki was hit by a truck riding his bicycle home. There was a bag of groceries nearby; the police assumed he was on his way home from the supermarket. He wasn\u2019t carrying anything but coins at the time \u2014 No phone, no wallet, and no ID. His bicycle was unregistered.\nThe police door-knocked for clues. It was slow, painstaking work, but eventually they found his apartment.\nI thought of a broken body and a mangled bicycle on a winter night. Of spilled groceries and scattered coins on the pavement. I imagined a foggy, ragged breath, fading into a dim, lonely silence.\nAnd for whatever reason, I thought of a watercolor painting of a house, somewhere far away in the countryside.\nAnd I wept.\nWhen I told Toshiko, it was like she already knew. She nodded, sipped from her gin tonic, and stared up at the smoke by the ceiling.\n\u201cI will miss him,\u201d she said.\nAnd I realized then that if Toshiko held any other feelings about that moment or Hiroki, I would not see them here. They would express themselves in gentle, flowing arcs of color, thrown against paper.\nRambling, aimless arcs I hoped would be beautiful.\nBeautiful and hopeful.\nWhen I left the bar that night, Toshiko walked with me up the stairs. We stayed there a time, watching a gentle rain fall upon lonely Shinjuku streets.\n\u201cYou shouldn\u2019t come back here,\u201d she said.\n\u201cWhat? Why?\u201d\n\u201cThis place, it\u2019s not for you. It\u2019s for people who lose what they can\u2019t get back.\u201d\n\u201cWhat about you?\u201d\n\u201cI lost Hiroki,\u201d she said. \u201cI lost your friend. And the color of his memories is my muse now.\u201d\nShe kissed me gently on the lips, and looked into my eyes.\n\u201cBut you still carry him with you,\u201d she said. \u201cYou still have him, and you always will.\u201d\nI sometimes think about that rainy night, and the minutes that passed before Toshiko and I separated; when I wanted to kiss her, and hold her, and not let go.\nI think about that bar in Shinjuku, and the bartender who hides behind his doors the stories of those who visit \u2014 the ghosts and spirits who might never find what they\u2019re looking for, but find in the bar a comfortable purgatory.\nAnd when I think of Hiroki, I think of a painting of two boys sitting on a park bench in winter; one of them in color, one in black and white.\nAnd I wonder which is me.\n\u2014 -\nMusic\nRead more more about the spirits that haunt the bar on Twitter.\n...\nIf you enjoyed this story, please consider supporting my writing on Patreon here.\nI also write a free monthly newsletter about creativity and publishing here.\nThanks for reading! \u2014 Hengtee\n", "claps": "20K claps", "author": "Snippets", "comments": ["I have to\u200a\u2014\u200awant to\u200a\u2014\u200abelieve that you\u2019re a whiskey drinker, having written this \u2764", "Are all Japanese stories this cozy and mystical?

This was expected; to say our findings might shock the world was an understatement \u2014 we had taken what people knew about life and death and flipped the idea on its head.\nIt was only natural that many didn\u2019t want to believe it, and it\u2019s perhaps only natural that many still don\u2019t.\nBut that\u2019s life, really; whether this one or the next.\nBelief, I think, is a matter of choice.\nI remember the day our findings made the news. I was tired and worn out. It had been a long day, and a longer night, and I felt anxious. I turned off my computer, left my phone on my desk, and took a book to a local cafe.\nAt a table by the window, I sipped at coffee and tried to empty my mind. I sometimes glanced at Sara as she served customers, wiped the counter, or stared into space. The sight of her was comforting.\nI remember deciding I would finally talk to her. I had always thought of Sara as my soulmate, and had long felt a connection between us, like an invisible string tying our hearts together.\nFor the longest time, I put that feeling down to an overactive imagination, but now I knew it was true.\nPeople looked to poke holes in our results, and find fault in our data. The amount of skepticism in the news was healthy, but the ignorance and outright attacks were more than a little overwhelming.\nIt\u2019s funny to think of how difficult it is to argue with cold, hard facts, but how often we see them crumble beneath faith and strong emotions. It\u2019s like there\u2019s the truth we\u2019re willing to accept, and the truth we\u2019re not.\nIn the end, I didn\u2019t speak to Sara that day. I thought about it, and knew what I wanted to say, but couldn\u2019t quite find the words or the timing.\nAnd even though I\u2019d been through this experience countless times, I wanted it to be different with Sara. I wanted it to have the appropriate weight and gravitas.\nI wanted it to be special.\nFor those who met and talked to successful transmigrants, it was more difficult to outright deny the research. The anecdotal evidence shared a theme; transmigrants had a deeper understanding of the human condition, and a reciprocal empathy outside of what could be considered normal.\nTalking to them, one man said, felt like talking to someone who saw colors beyond the human spectrum.\nMy favorite description was in the New York Times, and read, \u201cIn his eyes were hundreds \u2014 perhaps thousands \u2014 of years, and this depth of experience colored his very being, from the way he smiled to the way he walked.\u201d\nIt was delightfully unbelievable, and yet entirely true.\nThe following morning, Sara spoke to me while she brewed coffee. She had seen the news and was curious, and had noticed my name tag.\n\u201cYou\u2019re with Globaltech,\u201d she said.\n\u201cI am.\u201d\n\u201cYou guys are all over the internet. Congratulations. It\u2019s a big discovery.\u201d\n\u201cThanks. But you know, it\u2019s still a little hard to wrap my head around it all.\u201d\n\u201cYou and the rest of the world,\u201d she said.\nThe conversation felt easy and natural. Pleasant, and light. I wondered why I hadn\u2019t simply said hello when I first saw her.\n\u201cSo are you a part of the big team, then?\u201d she said. \u201cYou know, the transmigration department?\u201d\nI shook my head.\n\u201cI wish I was,\u201d I said, \u201cbut I\u2019m just a data sifter. Not quite smart enough to roll with the big guys.\u201d\nBut to be honest, I was just hesitant to talk about it. There was still so much we didn\u2019t know. So much impact we had to think about. So much potential and so much risk.\n\u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d she said, \u201cyou look pretty smart to me.\u201d\nHer cheeky smile was nostalgic, her tone of voice playful and mocking. It was like her brain wanted to give me the benefit of the doubt, but her instincts wouldn\u2019t let her.\n\u201cLooks, deceiving, etcetera,\u201d I said.\nAnd though the banter was not love yet, it resembled something similar, and I enjoyed it because I knew where it was going.\nI knew where it went.\nInitially, we only wanted to organize people\u2019s memories.\nWe knew where memories were stored, and we had a basic idea of how they functioned, so we wanted to catalogue them for more efficient recall. We thought if we could find a way into a person\u2019s memory library, we could create a tagging system.\nAs expected, locating the memories wasn\u2019t the hard part; giving them a logical order was. The brain isn\u2019t particularly keen on reorganizing itself, and when we attempted to herd memories into a single location, we lost more than we saved.\nBy observing patterns in brain activity, we were able to help people recall the past with more clarity, and we came to understand how the brain creates real estate for new memories. From there, we tried to work backwards.\nThe idea was if we could locate a person\u2019s first memory, we could map a path to their most recent. With enough maps, we could find patterns, and we expected these patterns to be the keys to our success.\nHowever, when we started digging deeper, test subjects began to share memories outside of their own lifetime. They recalled vivid images of times before they were born, countries they had never visited, and friends and family they had never known.\nIt took a long time to understand exactly what all of these random, disconnected memories meant, but eventually it clicked. It was like digging through a library and finding another beneath it, and one below that, and on and on and down and down, like an eternal tower of collected memories.\nWe realized we had stumbled into libraries of past lives.\nWe had discovered proof of transmigration.\n\u201cYou\u2019re not wearing your name tag today,\u201d Sara said.\n\u201cHave you seen the people outside the building?\u201d I said. \u201cAnd the people out front with the protest signs? It\u2019s a jungle out there.\u201d\nFor the most part, people were in one of two categories: those who wanted it, and those who wanted it gone. The first group wanted us to open testing to the public; their fear was that access to past memories would be reserved for the rich.\nThe second group simply thought we were committing grave crimes against nature; if we were meant to have those memories, they said, we would have had them to begin with.\nSara watched a few protesters walk by outside the cafe, and sighed.\n\u201cI guess I can understand why people are worried,\u201d she said. \u201cBut why won\u2019t Globaltech open testing to the public? Why make a big announcement like that and then go dead quiet?\u201d\nI thought about it for a time.\n\u201cWell, the process is inconsistent,\u201d I said. \u201cEveryone is different, and there are so many variables to consider with each individual. The process of unlocking memories is still more dangerous than they\u2019re willing to admit.\u201d\n\u201cIs that so?\u201d she said.\n\u201cI mean, well, that\u2019s my best guess,\u201d I said, \u201cbeing a simple data-sifter and all.\u201d\n\u201cOf course.\u201d\nSara brewed the rest of my coffee with a smile that charmed and irked me in equal measure, because I knew she had won. I also knew that if she ever asked me for the truth \u2014 or anything at all, for that matter \u2014 I would give it to her in an instant for another glimpse of that smile.\nI always did.\nOver time, we discovered patterns through each layer of a person\u2019s memory. And though we couldn\u2019t interfere with the organization of a memory library, we were able to observe the unique way each was organized, regardless of the life being present, or past.\nWe thought of these patterns as memory fingerprints.\nI snuck back to work through the basement parking lot, and went to my office.\nThe space was a mess of memos, case studies, and miscellaneous paper work. I sat down, looked at my reflection in the blank computer screen, and took a long, deep breath.\nIt was like a thick forest of memories before me, but I was sure that somewhere in those reports, interviews, and recorded recollections, was a pattern. And if I could find that pattern, I could carve a path through that forest, and eventually, draw a map.\nBut when I thought about Sara, and the spontaneity that came with first meeting her, and learning to know her and love her for the first time, I didn\u2019t know if I wanted to carve that path anymore. Some journeys, I thought, were better for the surprises they brought. They were better without a map.\nBut eventually, and inevitably, I turned on my computer and got to work.\nLove, I told myself, was a matter of choice.\nOur first investors \u2014 and so, our first major test subjects \u2014 were mostly rich, Silicon Valley types who were terrified of death, and wanted to live forever.\nIn meetings they expressed a desire for a method to track transmigration. They wanted to leave their riches not to family, but to their future selves, so they might build long, storied careers over multiple lifetimes.\nThe problem was that though we could identify a unique memory library, it was still impossible to know where the next one would be built. I had spent months reading and rereading interviews, but I had yet to find any causal relationships between lives; it appeared to me the jumps were entirely random \u2014 body to body, brain to brain, life to life.\nIn order to track transmigration, it would be necessary to database the entire world\u2019s memory fingerprints, and tag all of them at birth so they could be processed accordingly. This alone would be hugely complicated, and require the cooperation of every country on the planet.\nSuch a change also brought with it a host of ethical questions many of our investors had yet to consider. We didn\u2019t bring these up, however, because we needed the money to continue.\n\u201cI don\u2019t know why they don\u2019t just make it public, and let people do it,\u201d Sara said. \u201cThe world is so divisive on the issue, you know? Wouldn\u2019t it be in Globaltech\u2019s best interests to create positive rapport around the idea?\u201d\n\u201cI see where you\u2019re coming from, but I don\u2019t think it\u2019s as simple as just signing people up and collecting good reviews. This goes so much deeper, because it connects us in a way previously unimaginable. It strikes at the heart of many people\u2019s core value structures, and the very beliefs they\u2019ve built their lives upon.\u201d\nSara pouted.\n\u201cI don\u2019t see what\u2019s so scary about it,\u201d she said. \u201cI really don\u2019t.\u201d\n\u201cSo if I had a sign up sheet with me, and I gave it to you, would you do it? Would you go through the process, knowing you could never go back?\u201d\n\u201cI know I would,\u201d she said. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t even think twice about it.\u201d\nThere was a glimmer in her eyes when she spoke. It was a purity of self-confidence, and trust in her own decisions. It was a trait that, as far back as I could remember, I had always lacked, always respected, and always loved.\n\u201cI\u2019m sure if you did it then, it would go well,\u201d I said.\n\u201cHm?\u201d\nI shook my head.\n\u201cIt\u2019s nothing,\u201d I said. \u201cForget about it.\u201d\nThe reason we never made the process public was simple: not everyone was ready for the weight of their past lives, and we didn\u2019t have a reliable way of identifying who was.\nGoing through the transmigration process was like unlocking every floor, and every door, in every memory library in your brain. You gained unlimited access in an instant, but none of those doors would ever lock again. That was the cost.\nSo when people got lost, or found books that horrified them, or could not bear the weight of so many different libraries, the brain would sometimes react by shutting off access to the past entirely. It was like burning all the books as a knee-jerk survival tactic. But what it left was little more than an empty, breathing husk, capable only of experiencing the present.\nTo carry the memories of twenty, fifty, or a hundred lives meant to carry the feelings and emotions that sculpted each of them \u2014 on one hand happiness, knowledge, and experience, but on the other regret, loss, and sadness.\nAll of these emotions played out over and over, again and again, and rested entirely on the shoulders of a single, vulnerable soul.\nIt was a weight not everyone could bear.\nSara followed the transmigration news with an inquisitive eye and an open-minded humor. It was a topic we could easily share, and our best excuse to keep talking.\n\u201cDid you see they\u2019ve started a transmigrational search petition?\u201d\n\u201cA search petition?\u201d I asked. \u201cFor what?\u201d\n\u201cIt seems the internet wants Globaltech to do a dedicated search for the current iteration of Jesus Christ.\u201d\n\u201cOh. I don\u2019t know if that\u2019s going to work out.\u201d\nThe idea of looking for Jesus was very much a needle-in-a-haystack kind of a deal, but the petitions did shine a light on how little people knew of our research. It also made me sad to think we wanted transmigration to find us people to solve our problems, instead of using it to solve them ourselves.\n\u201cBut wait,\u201d Sara said. \u201cJesus isn\u2019t the only one. There are also petitions for Mother Teresa, Elvis, Jeff Buckley, Gandhi, and... Buddha.\u201d\n\u201cBuddha? But Buddha was enlightened.\u201d\n\u201cI know! Isn\u2019t it crazy?\u201d\nSara messed up my coffee that day because she was laughing, but her smile brought to mind the memory of us walking along the beach on a cool afternoon. I remember knowing I had to tell her I was going to war, and wondering if that laugh would still be waiting for me when I got back.\nI never found out.\nThere were debates over extending criminal punishment into future lives, and whether criminals in one life should be considered criminals in the next. The death penalty was abolished, because it suddenly felt like a free pass.\nBusinesses contacted us to ask whether they should make transmigrational investigation a part of their vetting process, and Globaltech began considering a consultation team for just these kinds of requests.\nElsewhere, a prominent alt-right spokesperson was mobbed when a report leaked, revealing he had once been a slave on a plantation in Georgia. His party fell into a spiral of infighting and disillusion that looked something like a karmic whirlwind.\nIn other, quieter parts of the world, blankets of mass-suicides were reported in small communities that rolled the dice and hoped for better luck the next time around. This news was always the heaviest, because I had never imagined it a possibility, however logical it might have been.\nLife too, I came to realize, was a choice.\nI sometimes woke at my desk at odd hours of the evening, alone except for a desk full of papers, and the dull light of my computer screen.\nIn my dreams, I watched a flood of past lives interweave across an endless series of rooms, like an M.C. Escher painting at a scale beyond comprehension.\nAnd yet, somewhere in those rooms was a pattern like the hint of a color painted across the walls, or a feeling that hung in the air like the gentle scent of spring flowers.\nIt was a connection like an invisible string, tying two hearts together.\nPerhaps surprisingly, religion didn\u2019t change very much.\nThere was an initial uproar over the consequences of a transmigrational reality, but most people chose to stay right where they were. And while some religions combed old texts for an answer to the question of traveling souls, many others chose to deny it outright.\nI was surprised at first, to think people could deny facts, science, and research, but upon further thought, I realized that was simply how the world worked. People believe what they want, and choose to believe otherwise when it fits with their belief structure.\nReality struck me like a house built upon a series of choices; a house too many people didn\u2019t want to build a second time.\nIn Sara\u2019s every movement were flashes of her former lives.\nIn her every gesture was everything she had ever been; a countless number of pasts combined to create a unique present moment.\nI was in love all over again, but a certain part of it would be forever unrequited. Sara could never love me as I loved her, because even though life was destined to run a course to our inevitable romance, she would never understand it as the multilayered, interwoven phenomenon that I did.\nIn these moments, I felt a keen sense of regret for my decision; a decision that felt like reading the last page of a book first, and only now realizing what I was missing out on by knowing the ending.\nA month before Globaltech announced our research findings, they offered all of us in the department a chance to undergo the transmigrational unlocking process for free.\nEveryone had read the paperwork and knew the risks, so the vast majority said no.\nFor my part, I was going through something of an existential crisis; I didn\u2019t have many friends, and my relationship with my family was tenuous at best. I craved a sense of perspective.\nI said yes.\nWhen I looked at Sara, I saw the past.\nThough we had first met at her cafe two months after I started work with Globaltech, before that I had met her in the snowy mountains of Japan, and let her slip through my grasp when she was the daring pilot of a hot air balloon traveling across Europe. I had watched her die in my arms, and also returned the favor, and on three occasions we had grown old together.\nI knew her well enough to know that once we fell into a shared orbit, we were powerless to resist the gravity that pulled us together. When it came to our romance, a part of me was content to let the flow of life bring our hearts into balance.\nBut another part of me wondered if this was just a step in the transmigrational journey, and if at some point, it would end.\nThe research team was happy to have a transmigrant in the office, because it meant for more detailed analysis, and more detailed feedback. I took part in interviews each day, describing old memories as I wiped the dust from their book covers, and recalling the sensations that came with them.\nThe memories came at a slow and gradual pace, sometimes in dreams, but mostly in quiet moments, where stray thoughts brought flashes of people and places that felt at once both new and old at the same time.\nI told the team how my outlook on life and the world was changing. I realized that every decision I had ever worried about was ultimately meaningless, because I had made it hundreds of times before and the world had kept spinning. The wars and struggles that defined our generation were ultimately petty, because they had happened before and they would happen again, and still, the world would continue to spin.\nI told the team I realized that love would never make as much sense as I wanted, no matter how many lives I lived, but I would always keep chasing it because I always had. But even love, I said, was just another feeling along a spectrum of so many others \u2014 pushing us to action and driving us to change, but ultimately leaving little lasting impact.\nI told them multiple pasts made me want to enjoy the present moment, because the best thing about transmigration was enjoying each life for its individual color, and the blend of feelings and circumstance that made each unique.\nBut I did not tell them that between these lives was a feeling like a string pulling one life to another \u2014 sometimes to heartbreak, and sometimes to loss, but occasionally to an interweaving of souls, and a settling of hearts.\nI didn\u2019t have words for the depth of that feeling, so I kept it to myself.\n\u201cIf we know that transmigration is true,\u201d Sara said, \u201cWhy are there not more enlightened people?\u201d\n\u201cWe don\u2019t have nearly enough data to really comment, unfortunately.\u201d\n\u201cBut what about you? What do you think?\u201d\n\u201cI think for most of us,\u201d I said, \u201cit\u2019s a process that takes thousands of years, maybe longer. In all the data, I can\u2019t find any connections between lives, so if enlightenment is the goal, it feels like trial and error every time; over and over, life after life. My best guess is we\u2019re either blocked from our past memories as a kind of defense mechanism, or there\u2019s some key to it and we still haven\u2019t found it.\u201d\n\u201cSo there\u2019s no connection from one life to another? No karmic carry over? No staircase to raised consciousness? Nothing?\u201d\n\u201cI...\u201d I started, and then thought for a moment. \u201cWell, there is one thing.\u201d\n\u201cWhat is it?\u201d\n\u201cThis sounds silly, but would you believe me if I told you it\u2019s possible to love across lives? From one life to the next, over and over, like a collection of short stories with a shared theme?\u201d\n\u201cAs in, maybe you loved me in a few past lives? Something like that?\u201d\n\u201cUh... yes?\u201d\nI watched the thought weave a picture in Sara\u2019s mind.\n\u201cThat sounds nice,\u201d she said finally, \u201cbut you know, you don\u2019t have to make up a fancy lie if you just want to ask me out on a date.\u201d\nI laughed.\n\u201cI... hm. I guess I don\u2019t, do I?\u201d\n\u201cSo?\u201d\n\u201cSo, do you want to go out some time?\u201d\n\u201cHow about a movie? tomorrow night?\u201d\nThere was a smile that spread across Sara\u2019s face in that moment, and it came with the flash of a hundred different memories, all at once.\nIt was the look I fell in love with.\nI decided to review our collected data all over again \u2014 every success, every failure, and everything in between.\nI had been looking for the effects of one life on another; the evidence of a traceable karma, or an action and reaction between lives. But I wondered now: what if transmigration was not causal, but thematic?\nI wondered if certain emotions or actions ran like a narrative through individual lives, or if a person\u2019s past lives were ruled by feelings or encounters that repeated until some kind of goal was met.\nGlobaltech believed this might help with locating a person\u2019s future life, so they gave the green light, and I started reading.\nSara never met me at the cinema the following night, and she wasn\u2019t at the cafe the day after.\nInstead, I found her in the hospital, asleep in a cozy room with a big window, at the end of a corridor on the fourth floor.\nShe\u2019d fallen into a coma, the doctor said. It was a brain aneurysm.\nAnd though I wanted to cry for the injustice of such timing, and for the way fate had conspired to end our romance before it even started, I found that I simply couldn\u2019t.\nI had a thousand memories of love found and love lost, and all of them told me this was how life was. This was how it went.\nWhether this life, or the next.\nThe day Globaltech finally announced that we still didn\u2019t know how to locate future lives, the world responded with something that felt like a collective sigh for the hopes and dreams of the future.\nWhen I had sifted our data, I hoped I might find a case like my own; something with a clear thread that linked transmigrations across a single soul.\nIn the end, we didn\u2019t find anything. Not a single clue.\nWe were left only with thousands of maps; each one detailing the path a soul had traveled, but leaving its future a mystery.\nWhen I spent time with Sara\u2019s family, I found myself wishing I could be sadder and more miserable, instead of wrapped in a blanket of empathy and understanding.\nI lived with a nostalgia for the times that were just like this one \u2014 times of loss, and heartbreak, and death. It was a story in which the setting and the characters changed every time, but the plot remained ever constant.\nWith the knowledge of transmigration came the feeling that important experiences had been taken from me and replaced with a dull aching in my heart; an aching for what once was, and for what was destined to repeat again and again.\nIt was a very peculiar sadness, and one I could not share.\nI wondered if this was the reason we were never meant to remember our past lives.\nWithout any concrete benefits outside of a superior peace of mind, it became difficult to get further funding for our department. We realized that the vast majority of people didn\u2019t want a longer past; they wanted a brighter, clearer future.\nWe continued research on a smaller scale at prisons and in hospices, where access to past lives gave people perspective and hope, but without any major breakthroughs, we were unable to secure funding for larger, more in-depth studies.\nAnd though transmigrational prejudice is still a problem in some parts of the world, transmigration and the transmigrationally aware are slowly becoming just another part of the cultural fabric that makes up our world.\nNot long after Sara was taken off life support, I quit my job at Globaltech and decided to travel. I packed a backpack with some clothes and a few books, and headed for Asia.\nSometimes, I stare at the passing scenery from public transport and wonder if I made the right choice; I wonder if knowing I would meet Sara again was worth missing out on the experience of truly loving her and losing her in this life, however fleeting that experience might have been.\nBut there is no precedent for this feeling in my memories, so I simply carry it with me, like another book in my backpack.\nAnd I like to think that however much the universe might conspire to keep us apart, and wherever Sara might be in her new life, there is still a connection between us, like an invisible string tying our hearts together.\nAnd I like to believe it will always be like that. Whether this life, or the next.\nBecause belief, after all, is a matter of choice.\n\u2014 -\nMusic\n...\n...\nIf you enjoyed this story, please consider supporting my writing on Patreon here.\nI also write a free monthly newsletter about creativity and publishing here.\nThanks for reading! \u2014 Hengtee\n", "claps": "8.2K claps", "author": "Snippets", "comments": ["Your work of fiction was beautifully written.. it was the perfect split of romance and the debate on technology (even though its not real).

I absolutely must have meat for lunch and dinner or else my inner demon would unleash and bring upon wrath on this world.\nA few months back I was having a conversation on food with my friends and they mentioned that meat production is more environmentally damaging than the production of plant based food items. And of course, I had to object in disbelief. It just doesn\u2019t make sense, food is food how is the production of one more environmentally damaging than the other?\nConfident that the difference in carbon emissions between meat and plant products is not much, I read up multiple sources all of which led to similar statistics as such:\nWhat do they do in beef and dairy production?* Seriously! If you are doubting the numbers above(as I did), the final numbers are the median of emissions intensity in the world for each food product and they were retrieved from Food and Agriculture Organisation of the United Nations (FAO).\nAfter staring at and pondering on the statistics for a bit, I thought to myself well...my consumption wouldn\u2019t make a significant carbon footprint anyway. Or would it?\n*Question answered here: https://www.vegansociety.com/go-vegan/why-go-vegan\nAfraid to seek the truth, I plucked some courage and soldiered on to analyse the meat carbon footprint of my lunches for a year. I only analyse lunches because it is the most protein dense meal of my day. Furthermore, I prepare my lunches in advance and would measure the amount of protein I\u2019m consuming to achieve some muscle growth. On average, I try to hit about 60g of proteins per lunch and I would prepare 4 lunch boxes a week.\nTo my horror, here\u2019s what I uncovered:\nTo clarify, the calculations done above were as such:January protein CO2 emissions =( (amt of poultry eaten in Jan * CO2 generated per kg of poultry produced) +(amount of pork eaten in Jan* CO2 generated per kg of pork produced) +(amount of beef eaten in Jan* CO2 generated per kg of beef produced) ) *4 days = 45.2kg\nSo on and so forth for all the months in a year.\nConsidering that the numbers above are a conservative estimate and that these numbers only account for 4 lunches a week, one can only imagine my carbon footprint if I considered all meals for all days throughout the year.\nNow how impactful are my consumption habits to the Earth exactly? It is obvious that changes in an individual\u2019s diet alone(in this case mine) will not cause a significant change but as a global, collective effort, carbon emissions can be fiercely reduced. As of now, 15% of the world\u2019s greenhouse gas emissions are contributed by raising livestock for food. With the population expected to increase to 10 billion, humans will eat 70% more meat by 2050. Then greenhouse gases from food production could rise by as much as 92%.\nThe predictions on future carbon emissions are devastating and frankly, I as much as I love meat, I absolutely adore what Mother Nature has blessed us with and I cannot emphasise enough, how thankful I am for having clean air.\nDetermined to not give up meat completely(at least not now) but also wanting to reduce my carbon footprint, I experimented with alternative meal plans to evaluate how drastic changes have to be made to reduce the damage caused by my consumption habits.\nAs seen in the bar chart above, beef production is one of the most detrimental meats to produce and reducing beef consumption would yield the biggest decrease in my carbon footprint. As such, I decided that I should only consume beef for one week a month at most and each portion of beef prepared should be reduced. With a reduced amount of beef, the protein is to be compensated by introducing eggs into the diet.\nBy replacing beef with proteins that have smaller carbon emissions, we can see that my carbon footprint decreased by 304.2 kg which is a whooping 45.2% reduction in my lunches\u2019 carbon emissions! I would definitely, convert to this alternative meal plan because the changes made not only fulfil my protein goals but are also very easy to implement. Who wouldn\u2019t love more pork, fish and eggs in their diet?\nIf you\u2019re wondering why I did not use chicken to replace beef it\u2019s because I already consume chicken very frequently. It is the most affordable meat and any increase in chicken consumption would definitely cultivate a repulsion for chicken meat.\nWith much hype on becoming vegan(which seem like an almost impossible state for me to achieve), I decided to explore a slightly more plant based diet to see how much more my carbon footprint can be reduced from Diet Alternative 1 above.\nWith introduction of lentils to replace a portion of pork, my carbon footprint decreased by 6.1kg from my Diet Alternative 1 and that is a 1.7% decrease in my lunches\u2019 carbon emissions. Frankly, I find the results rather underwhelming given all the hype about how going vegan would make you a lot more environmentally friendly.\nAnd the hype is not wrong. What I would like to highlight here, is that going vegan definitely puts you on the high way to achieving sustainable consumption habits. But be aware how working your way to becoming vegan is exactly benefitting the Earth.\nWith reference to the bar chart, we see that the amount of carbon emissions generated from fish, poultry and even pork products do not differ greatly from emissions generated by plant based foods. Furthermore it might take 3 servings of plant based foods to achieve the same protein amounts as 1 serving of meat, thereby levelling the carbon emission amounts for both food types. What matters in this case, is that high impact food types like beef, lamb, goat and dairy are to be replaced by smaller impact food types regardless of meat or plant based foods.\nAlthough a smaller carbon footprint can be achieved by consuming low impact meats, consuming plant based foods in place is a more sustainable way to feed a growing population. Since a plant based diet only requires one third of the land needed for a meat and dairy diet, adopting a plant based diet can significantly reduce the strain on food and other resources.\nThere are many reasons why Mother Nature would thank you for becoming vegan and you can explore them here: https://www.vegansociety.com/go-vegan/why-go-vegan.\nOur meat consumption habits are not sustainable and I hope my epiphany from analysing my own diet would have you to think twice about your food consumption habits too.\nReferences:\n", "claps": "164 claps", "author": "Rongyi Ang", "comments": [], "link": "https://medium.com/@rongyiang/meat-heat-11f33aa7cae5"}, {"title": "They\u2019ll run out of things to talk about. \u2013 The Every Day Novelist \u2013 Medium", "num_comments": 1, "tags": ["food", "writing", "creativity", "commonplace book", "cooking"], "reading_time": 3, "text": "When I saw this quote today, I knew I had to use it for The Commonplace Book Project.\nI hear writers say all the time that they just don\u2019t have that much to say.

I savor these types of moments, when the water is calm and there\u2019s a low hum of highway traffic. Sometimes I\u2019ll listen to music or read a book and linger for half an hour or so before moving on.\nThe last two days have brought true spring weather. The leaves have bloomed, everything is green again, and pollen is absolutely everywhere. Life, reborn. Yesterday, I went in circles, first around a lake by bike, then on foot around a pond.\nA bicycle is my primary mode of transportation. I use it every day for work, but commuting 70km (around 44 miles) per week through traffic and construction can be a slog. Especially in the rain. When the weather is nice, though, I like to get outdoors and work up a sweat.\nIn the early days of the internet, my first AOL screenname was Biking4Lif. I can\u2019t remember if Biking4Life was already taken or there was a character limit. I must have been around 12 at the time. I biked everywhere in my hometown, exploring every nook and cranny of the subdivisions that sprouted and grew behind my house on the aptly named Main Street.\nAs a teenager, I dreamt of riding in the Tour de France, and used to watch 30 minute highlight reels about the race on ESPN a couple years before Lance Armstrong lost a testicle and decided doping was a good idea. But there was something majestic, even exotic about speeding through the French countryside and suffering during long climbs up the Alps and Pyrenees. I never thought I\u2019d actually one day live here.\nDespite having been here for a little more than 8 years now, there are so many areas I have yet to explore. The pond at Saint Nicolas park was completely new for me the first time I visited in February. Now that I live close by, I can be there in less than ten minutes. There are places where it feels untouched by time.\nToday, I ventured south along the Maine to where it intersects with the much larger Loire river, before turning around near a town called Savennie\u0300res. There were many people of all ages out and about, walking and biking and jogging. I saw campers parked along the banks and folks paddling in boats, fathers teaching daughters to cast a line into the lake, and toddlers haunched over to pick up slimy wet rocks. I zoomed by on my bike, stopping occasionally for a water break or to take a picture of a rather scenic view.\nThere and back was about a 30 km (18.64 miles) roundtrip, which isn\u2019t super far, but then again I did this on a mountain bike. Sometimes I rue not having a road bike here with me. They\u2019re much lighter and faster and remind me of those days of wanting to be like Mario Cipollini, sprinting across finish lines with my arms spread wide. But, having front and rear suspension enables me to do more technical riding over bumpier off-road terrain. There\u2019s always a trade off.\nThere are segments of this path where there\u2019s no one around in any direction and the path is shaded by overhanging limbs from trees. In those moments I\u2019m transported back home, where a vast network of bike paths go on for many, many miles.\nOn the way back, I stopped to read for awhile on a bench in Parc Balzac, near the lake.

No, not a question, said while wagging a finger and doing an Amanda Priestly impersonation, it simply does.\nPhotography shouldn\u2019t suck, as it\u2019s never been easier. Which might just be a big part of the problem.\nIt\u2019s so easy today, that a self anointed expert, with YouTube followers in the six figures, can profile a new lens while shooting it with one hand and recording himself on his iPhone with the other.\nSomething that easy isn\u2019t likely to engage one\u2019s brain, but that\u2019s not the whole answer, as people who really want to be good at photography suck at it as well.\nMaking photography easy has been the goal of camera manufacturers since Kodak introduced the Brownie. Easy things should be easy, like playing bass kind of easy.\nYou hear about the guy who signed up for five easy lessons on playing bass? He missed the last three because he had a gig.\nThere\u2019s plenty of bass players out there, but there\u2019s only one Bootsy Collins, and whatever he did to become great wasn\u2019t easy to learn, or easy to survive for that matter.\nPhotography starts out easy enough. it only becomes hard once you start getting good at it. It\u2019s fun, a learnable craft, a hobby, but be careful. You feed it after midnight, like my buddy did, and it can turn into a real monster.\nLearning this craft in the darkroom days was difficult. We all know this, even those of us who\u2019ve never worked in one. It\u2019s a cliche. Still, we use this as a touchstone to mark the craft\u2019s decline. The ease of digital lowered the bar, lowered the self-culling rate that once encouraged low and medium talents to find the lightproof, revolving door and show themselves out.\nMy buddy took it a step further. He raised an interesting point that is worth exploring.\nHe challenged me to think of a world where nothing in media was \u201creal\u201d, whether that medium was working in fiction or nonfiction, everything and anything could be depicted on screen in a realistic manner. He used the release of James Cameron\u2019s The Abyss as the watershed. When that film came out in 1989, thirty years ago, its main selling point was the lifelike digital effects. Not the acting, or story telling, or anything else that is crucial to good film making. Just the special effects. Everything written about the movie, the reason people went to see it, was to see the groundbreaking computer trickery.\nThat\u2019s the place where today\u2019s young photographer grew up. If you think it, you can photograph it. They\u2019ve never known a world where post-production didn\u2019t exist.\nCombine that mindset with the infamous shaky camera Folgers Coffee commercial (which first aired at about the same time). Once, these commercials were carefully scripted stories designed to sell coffee, but now the story was gone. The narrative was replaced by style. Remove the story and there\u2019s no need for a moment, a resolution, or even a call to action (to put it in advertising terms).\nOf course, all narrative wasn\u2019t abandoned, and style didn\u2019t completely replace substance, but I do think there\u2019s something to this.\nImagine you\u2019ve grown up hearing only elevator music. There\u2019s still music, it\u2019s just that all the soul and creativity has been removed. With that as your base, what kind of music do you think you\u2019d create yourself?\nGarbage in, garbage out.\nMusic of course has an advantage over photography. If you want to tap into the power of classic music created by passionate artists who knew their craft, you sample it. You piggyback your new work onto the strong shoulders of those who came before you. There\u2019s no need to reinvent the wheel when James Brown\u2019s (pre or post Bootsy) wheel is still rocking and rolling along nicely.\nFilm directors use this same trick as well with the montage set to a pop music classic. It\u2019s easy to take a pretty woman and turn her into Pretty Woman when Roy Orbison has done all the heavy lifting.\nYou can\u2019t sample Eddie Adams. Joking! Don\u2019t be silly, of course you can. Just don\u2019t expect that your Lego recreations will help bring any wars to a quicker end. They will however look splendid hanging in some hipster\u2019s dining room. Oh the irony.\nAnd this is where we\u2019re at.\nWe\u2019ve gone from the mostly practical effects of the first three Star Wars films, which required a stunt person to do something risky and amazing, to the later versions that have Jedi Knights sprinting around like Benny Hill. As viewers we\u2019re invested in the first and laugh at the later.\nYes, I just searched \u201cstar wars benny hill\u201d on YouTube and this came up (along with many others). It\u2019s from the first Star Wars movie of course, but still makes the point. You\u2019re welcome.\nPhotography is about experiencing the moment. Observing something in real time and sharing it with the viewer in a visual appealing way. You\u2019ve got to be in the room to make that happen. You\u2019ve got to be on the street in Saigon. You\u2019ve got to know what it smells like before you can properly see it. This isn\u2019t writing after all. That\u2019s what photography is all about.\nPhotography today is like listening to music made by people who\u2019ve only experienced Muzak. They\u2019ve never heard the original version of Walk This Way. They don\u2019t know who Aerosmith is and Run DMC just frustrates them.\nAnd that\u2019s before we get into the whole old-white-males thing.\nThere\u2019s nothing older and whiter than Muzak (I\u2019m not sure on its gender), and that\u2019s what photography has become today. The influences that you should be studying aren\u2019t always at your fingertips. It takes work. It takes time. Sometimes it even takes money. You might need to buy a book now and then. It\u2019s easier to just get on the elevator and tap your toes. Don\u2019t fight it. Don\u2019t make any waves. Accept of course when someone makes a joke or two that offends you, then it\u2019s time to release the Kraken.\n(At this point I\u2019d like to offer my humble apologies to all the bass players out there.)\nPhotography is bland and lacks soul because it got rebooted. The past was forgotten so it was forced to start over. Right now it\u2019s in the Brownie stage of evolution. Everybody has a camera, it\u2019s easy, it\u2019s cheap and it is accessible. People are using it in very straightforward way, like how the first fashion photography mimicked the illustrations that Vogue had previously relied upon.\nThe fashion magazines and the photographers who served them evolved quickly, but they were motivated. Magazines made money. Lots of it. The photographers who served them best, who brought in readers, made money too. Sadly, we don\u2019t have that motivation anymore. Most of the photographers you see getting published today are working for peanuts on the frontend, and don\u2019t make any licensing fees for their work on the backend.\nWhere\u2019s the motivation in that?\nThe best photographers have largely left the party. The marketplace has forced them out. You can see it in the political coverage coming out of Washington DC and on the campaign trail. We\u2019re back in the Ektachrome 160, pushed a stop days. Pictures of record. Beto stood on another countertop. Here\u2019s the proof.\nDon\u2019t expect any of this to change anytime soon. Without competition there\u2019s no stress on the marketplace. No motivation to get better. No reason to evolve. The people who would have applied that pressure, who would have inspired and motivated the pack, have moved on.\nYou know it\u2019s true.\nThe same can be said for sports photography, portraits, street, name your genre. The low and medium talents are thriving. They think they\u2019re in the show, and they are. The fact that nobody cares to watch the show anymore is lost on them.\nTo answer the second question, the contest scandals, that aren\u2019t really contest scandals because the rules are vague, changed, or rationalized into meaningless drivel. This trend is also due to the rebooting of the craft. It\u2019s like the ectoplasm photos of the 1920\u2019s, or press photos before the idea of not setting things up was firmly established (say in the 1950\u2019s for most of us and around 1900 and never for National Geographic). People do it because they think the results are cool and they get rewarded for it.\nAt some point, well maybe, people will collectively realize that the power of photography lies in its ability to record a scene as it is, not as we imagine it to be. That the odd power line or telephone pole in an otherwise \u201cperfect\u201d landscape, makes the picture and doesn\u2019t ruin it.\nWell, we can hope. Evolution is a notoriously slow process.

What does it cost to host Unsplash?\nBack in 2016, Unsplash had just crossed 1 billion images viewed and 5.5M photos downloaded per month.\nOur team was smaller and our product was a lot less developed, which led to less services and less in-house processing. We had one main application, a traditional Rails monolith, that consumed a handful of services to create the basic Unsplash experience.\nHeavy features like search and realtime photo stats were in their infancy, which led to much simpler data processing requirements and the use of 3rd party services like Keen and a handful of CRON jobs.\nThe final monthly breakdown for April 2016 was:\nTotal (USD): $17,658.62\nA lot has changed.\nFor one, Unsplash is a hell of a lot bigger. 10+ times bigger. We now get more traffic from our API partners than our own website and official apps, despite these growing significantly.\nPartnering with some of the largest consumer facing apps in the world has pushed our engineering team to match their practices around redundancy, monitoring, and availability, which requires more supporting resources and services.\nOur product team has continued to push the envelope for core features like search and contributor stats, requiring more and more data to be processed in greater and greater volumes.\nAll of these things have pushed our architecture to be more complex, while also increasing the baseline costs.\nTotal monthly cost: $29,763\nWe continue to use Heroku as our main web platform. Despite its premium cost over AWS, Azure, and Google Cloud, Heroku\u2019s built-in deployment and configuration tools allow our team to move faster, more confidently, and more reliably.\nAs we\u2019ve detailed previously, the alternatives would undoubtably be cheaper on paper. But in reality, the increased simplicity and freedom offered by Heroku for a small, product-focused team is a major cost savings advantage.\nIn addition to our main web servers and databases using Heroku, we use Fastly for distributed CDN caching, Elastic Cloud for our Elasticsearch clusters, and Stream for our feed and notification architecture.\nTotal monthly cost: $7,679\nOur team is small for Unsplash\u2019s size, with our total product team counting in at just 11 people.\nWith no one dedicated to dev-ops, ensuring Unsplash is running smoothly and never goes down, requires a lot of instrumentation and reporting.\nDespite the volume of metrics we monitor and report on, New Relic, Sentry, and Datadog remain fairly inexpensive solutions. Our logging is certainly our largest monitoring expense, but the detailed information is crucial when debugging issues or rolling out new features.\nTotal monthly cost: $15,223\nData processing has been the area with the largest relative increase since 2016. Back then, analytics and data were an afterthought in our development process. We relied on tools like Google Analytics for user analytics and Keen for product metrics like photo views and downloads.\nSince then, we\u2019ve needed to expand our data collection, aggregation, and reporting significantly, both from a product and a company perspective. As Unsplash has grown, the volume has also increased considerably, with hundreds of millions of events tracked every day.\nWe\u2019ve replaced Google Analytics and Keen with an open-source data pipeline, Snowplow Analytics. Snowplow takes care of the data collection and formatting, allowing Tim, our data engineer, to focus on data aggregation, modelling, and visualization.\nWe\u2019ve also expanded the role of the data architecture in the product to handle all of our machine learning and search processing. As we go forward, we expect this to continue to be the biggest area of expansion.\nTotal monthly cost: $42,408\nImgix is our single biggest expense, but we love it. Yes there are cheaper options, but trust us when we say that they aren\u2019t as good for what we do.\nWe send petabytes of data through Imgix\u2019s CDN and render more than 250 million variations of our source images every month. Their reliability, performance, and flexibility is unmatched, and negotiating our contract through them actually allows us to discount our CDN costs due to their bulk negotiations with CDN providers.\nThe final monthly breakdown for February 2019 was:\nTotal (USD): $98,653\nComparing across the years, some trends emerge.\nDespite growing top-line metrics over 12x and significantly expanding the systems to include more features, reliability, and redundancies, hosting costs in total have only increased 5x.\nThere are few reasons backing this:\nAt the same time, the ratio between our hosting costs and the non-hosting software we use, like Github, Looker, and Slack, continues to increase, as it\u2019s a function of engineering team size. To put that in perspective, per engineer, Unsplash supports more users than Facebook at the equivalent point in time.\nHopefully getting a behind-the-scenes look at what it costs to run a site like Unsplash will help you with your own business, or at least give you a better understanding of what\u2019s involved.\nIf you\u2019re in a position to be able to share your company\u2019s costs, we\u2019d love to see.\nIf you have any questions, or want to dive deeper into this topic, give us a shout on twitter @lukechesser & @chrisliverani.

For the better.", "num_comments": "unspecified", "tags": ["growth", "referees", "football", "soccer", "sports"], "reading_time": 6, "text": "There is no doubt that football (or soccer if you like) is the world\u2019s most popular sport. The FIFA website reports that over half of the global population saw coverage of the 2018 FIFA World Cup, this means around a whopping 3.5 billion people, 51.3% of the global population watched some football over the summer of 2018.\nAll these people tuned in to admire France\u2019s heroics to overcome a gallant Croatian team. And whilst everyone can appreciate the skills of players like Mbappe or Griezmann, not enough people stop to appreciate the skills of the many referees that are part of this tournament.\nThe amount of work and sacrifices these individuals make to reach the pinnacle of international football are unbelievable. These referees have dedicated their lives to one of the most hated and controversial jobs in sports so that 3.5 billion people could enjoy football.\nI have spent over 10 years doing that same job in Italy and Australia\u2019s domestic leagues. I started my adventure in Milan, Italy, circa 2008, and since then I have turned into a completely different person.\nBack then I was quite shy, very self-conscious and lacked any type of real confidence. Today I\u2019m the exact opposite of that 19 years old, and I owe it all to football refereeing. This is what I learned.\nMany may think that in order to referee a football match all you need to do is know the rules, blow a whistle and show a card. If you\u2019re one of them, sorry to break it to you, but you couldn\u2019t be any wronger.\nWhen you\u2019re out on the field you have to interact with players, coaches and the other referees part of your team. Communication is pivotal in a successful performance. Players at any level, from juniors through to elite expect to be listened to and are never shy when it comes to express their opinion to an official. Referees need to be able to build relationships with all of the parties on the field to control the game and communicate effectively. When you watch a game you don\u2019t notice how referees talk to players, especially when they do it away from the spotlight. The importance of effective communication on the pitch becomes paramount for those who aspire to reach elite levels both in refereeing and real life. Through refereeing, I learned how to be understood quickly without beating around the bush. Maximum results minimum efforts. At the same time, I learned how to understand players\u2019 moods and how to approach tough individuals. All of this is no different to what we deal with in our everyday lives, referees practice this week in, week out.\nDuring a match, officials are called to make an incredible number of decisions which all have direct consequences on the outcome of a game.\nMany young people start refereeing in their teens as I did or even younger, and most life decisions you make can always be rectified if they turn out to be wrong. On the field of play, that\u2019s not the case: it doesn\u2019t matter how hard it is but you have to make a call. Even not making a call is a decision.\nRefeering strengthened my self-confidence when making decisions on the pitch, it forced me to make decisions in any circumstance by putting me under the spotlight. That transferred across to real life. I slowly started behaving more and more like a referee at work, I started making decisions independently whenever I was able to, most of which luckily were right, improving my productivity and reliability. To this day it is still recognised as one of my biggest strengths.\nThere is no need to lie, referees make mistakes. Lots of em. So does everyone, every day. The big difference is that when you are a football referee, everyone is judging you and every single decision you make.\nThe pressure that comes along with refereeing a football match is incredible, at every level referees will always be under scrutiny and most of the times criticised, whether they\u2019re right or wrong.\nThanks to the exposure social media and cable tv give to football, any decision an official makes will go viral within minutes of it happening. Sure, when I started Facebook & co. weren\u2019t as strong but coming from a country where football is bigger than religion, we\u2019d cop battering left, right and centre from local newspapers and local radio stations.\nThis kind of exposure has strengthened me incredibly. Many times I have been publicly criticised, had fingers pointed at and even had people stopping me in the middle of the road telling me I was wrong in last weekend\u2019s game. I had to build thick skin or I wouldn\u2019t have been able to go referee the following weeks. Sadly many stop officiating because of this criticism, but you\u2019re one of those who keep going you\u2019ll build your resilience and mental toughness to levels that you would have not expected when you started.\nHaving the strength to stand back up after a mistake and dealing with all the criticism plays a great role in workplaces. Especially as a designer when you have to please all of your stakeholders' fantasies having such thick skin helped me going through a lot.\nBeing a referee has taught me how to deal with any sort of pressure in my life. During a 90 minutes match, a referee runs an average of 12km alternating full-speed sprinting, jogging and sometimes just standing. This is very demanding at the elite level considering the speed players run at. On top of that add players and team officials complaining about anything you do, add a roaring crowd, being streamed on television and online and making a decision every 22 seconds, and you\u2019ll have the perfect recipe for a stressful experience. Many would crumble under this sort of pressure, but referees have been trained their entire career to cut out the noise, the camera lights, and focus on the game and making the right decision.\nThis doesn\u2019t happen overnight but through years and years of stepping through different levels and competitions domestically and internationally. Learning how to deal with external pressure, focusing on your performance and on what is in your control is fundamental for high performing roles where the stake in place are high, both in a work and home environments.\nCommon sense is a dying skill. You can\u2019t teach it in a class, some may learn overtime but unfortunately, fewer people every day value the use of common sense. There are things in life that don\u2019t have an answer or even a guideline on how to be dealt with.\nRefereeing taught me that there are situations where you have to do the right thing for the game. I learned when to break the rules for the good of the game because sometimes you just have to use good sense and sound judgment about a situation. Sometimes the simplest solution is the best solution, but being able to use common sense to see that it\u2019s not that common.\nRefereeing has been an amazing experience, these are just some skills that this discipline has made me develop over the years. When I look back at the decision I made to take on refereeing as a hobby, I had no idea what expected me. I couldn\u2019t be any more grateful for it. The things I learned, the experiences I lived and the memories that I will keep with me forever are priceless, and I wish more people could see who referee really are.\nI hope this article gave you a good insight from a different point of view on one of the most controversial roles in the world of sport.\n", "claps": "72 claps", "author": "Alessandro Arbizzani", "comments": [], "link": "https://medium.com/@alessandro.arbizzani/football-refereeing-changed-my-life-for-the-better-3ca38b5e7a83"}, {"title": "FIFA You Should Train Your Bots to Play Real Football", "num_comments": "unspecified", "tags": ["technology", "this happened to me", "artificial intelligence", "gaming", "sports"], "reading_time": 4, "text": "You do not think that I am an avid gamer, just in my free time I sometimes play mobile or computer games where you need to play for a long time and you need to achieve something, for example, an RPG where you need to improve your character or sports games, where need to assemble your team. And I also love sports, especially football, so FIFA is my favorite. But since I don\u2019t have much free time, I prefer the mobile version of this game so that you can play on the subway while you go home, or in any other free time when it\u2019s harder to get to the laptop.\nThe most interesting thing for me is the selection of the ideal composition for my team, buying and selling players, matches against real people, but sometimes you have to play games with bots when all sorts of in-game competitions appear, for example, for different holiday events. Then you have to play a huge number of games, where everything starts with an easy game and ends with games against teams with approximately the same rating as yours. But of course, this is done if you are not a beginner and you have a team with a high rating and with good compatibility. If you are a beginner, even the first games will be hard for you, but I will not even talk about difficult bots, there are no chances at all.\nNext, let\u2019s assume that you have a team with a good rating and you have been playing for a long time. In games with weak opponents, you will immediately feel that your opponent is weak and cannot even catch up with you in speed, bad passes, holds the ball poorly and does not hit the goal at all. Bots with a medium rating are already somehow trying to compete with you, but everything is also very simple there. I have no questions for these bots, they really play badly and should be for teams that have a rating lower than yours, although it would be interesting to be believable if these bots would sometimes play better than your team because even outsiders can win.\nTeams with the same rating as yours, or having at least a couple more units, are already playing much better, but they also can\u2019t do anything against you. And here I have questions, why does a team with the same rating as my team play much worse than my team, cannot beat my players, cannot pass well, cannot beat from afar and score goals. This is really very strange, I would like a more similar to a real football game, although I like to win and receive awards. Teams with a rating much higher than mine are already playing well, it turns out to fight with them, they defend the gate very well and take the ball away, give a good pass and sometimes score nice goals. But then you still need to improve the realization of the moments, because they score a lot less for the team, which is the favorite.\nI don\u2019t have so many questions for these bots, although it would be possible to shift their complexity so that teams with the same level as yours play like a team that is stronger than you so that weaker teams sometimes win against you and that strong teams don\u2019t give you a chance.\nSometimes when I play in these tournaments there are situations when I need to be distracted, and I decide not to pause the game and just leave if the score in the game allows me to do it. At this moment bot begins to play for my team, and I want to notice, makes it disgusting. Sometimes I specifically release the joystick and watch what happens. My team holds the ball well, sometimes it takes the ball from an opponent, but my players never give the ball to a partner and just run with the ball forward. And the strangest thing is, they never hit the goal, they just run into this gate and don\u2019t score, because the goalkeeper intercepts the ball.\nThe most important part of playing football is to score goals and win matches, so for me, it is very strange that the bot used for my team is not trained to fulfill the most important part of the game of football. Of course, the question is, why do I trust my team to this bot. But if it is there, why not use it, especially if you are a busy person, but you really want to go through these competitions. In fact, it\u2019s not very difficult to train a bot to score goals, I think to simplify the task, it would be possible to include the same bot for my team, which is used for my opponent, but it\u2019s very strange to put a bot who cannot score goals.\nI think it will be much easier to create my own deep neural network for the playing during the moments when I leave. There are already many ready-made bots that handle non-mobile versions of this game. But in any case, it will not solve the problem for bots created by FIFA, because they are very weak and would be worth improving them. But I hope this situation will change soon and I will be able to play this game with all pleasure.\n", "claps": "300 claps", "author": "Il Kadyrov", "comments": [], "link": "https://towardsdatascience.com/fifa-you-should-train-your-bots-to-play-real-football-7432121027c6"}, {"title": "Want to Learn a New Skill Faster?

Almost anyone can learn anything \u2014 with the right technique. Better learning approaches can make the process enjoyable.\nThe key to rapid skill acquisition isn\u2019t complicated.\nBut it takes time.\nThe good news is, you don\u2019t need to be an expert \u2014 you just need to practice enough to get the results you want.\nThe benefits of learning something new are enormous, especially for your working memory.\n\u201c..skill mastery is associated with increased activity in areas not engaged in skill performance, and this shift can be detected in the large-scale networks of the brain,\u201d explains Cornell University.\n\u201cIn addition to making existing synapses more robust, learning causes the brain to grow larger, says Scientific American. Just like other muscles, your brain strengthens itself over time as you learn new things.\nLearning new things also makes you happier. Research has found dopamine is closely linked to the learning process.\nWhether you aim to learn new technology, another language, or improve a skill you already know, using the best approaches can help you learn better, and faster.\nApplying the best learning style changes everything.\nThink about things you have learned recently and how you originally learned them. How did you learn and how long did it take you?\nAnd most importantly, do you still remember?\nDowntime is crucial to retaining anything you choose to learn.\nBreak-time is an important component of any serious learning session.\nAccording to recent research, taking short breaks, early and often, can help you learn things better and even improve your retention rate.\n\u201cEveryone thinks you need to \u2018practice, practice, practice\u2019 when learning something new. Instead, we found that resting, early and often, maybe just as critical to learning as practice,\u201d said Leonardo G. Cohen, M.D., Ph.D., a senior investigator at NIH\u2019s National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke.\nBetter breaks help the brain solidify, memories during the rest periods.\n\u201cI noticed that participants\u2019 brain waves seemed to change much more during the rest periods than during the typing sessions,\u201d said Marlene Bo\u0308nstrup, M.D., a postdoctoral fellow in Dr. Cohen\u2019s lab.\nWhatever you choose to learn over time, it\u2019s important to optimise the timing of rest intervals for better results.\nIn general, the longer you want to retain the knowledge, the longer your study break should be, says a study by Cepeda, Pashler, Vul, Wixted, and Rohrer.\n\u201c..students who took a one-day break did the best when tested after ten days, whereas those who took a whole month did best after six months. Thus, it appears that cramming all our studying into one session actually diminishes long-term learning.\u201d\nYou can significantly improve your skill acquisition by taking intentional long breaks in between sessions.\nWhen you begin to pick up a new skill or learn anything new, it\u2019s easy to binge-learn and obsessively work on it over time.\nBut spreading out learning, also known as distributed practice, with better breaks between sessions is known to be a better approach to learning.\n\u201cBreaks are important to minimise interference. When your hippocampus is forced to store many new (and often similar) patterns in a short space of time, it can get them jumbled up,\u201d writes David Cox of The Guardian.\nDistributed practice works really well if you lead a busy life.\nSo, instead of trying to learn that new language quickly, give yourself a lot of time overall, and break the process into small chunks throughout the day.\nExperts at the Louisiana State University\u2019s Center for Academic Success recommends 30\u201350 minutes sessions.\n\u201cAnything less than 30 is just not enough, but anything more than 50 is too much information for your brain to take in at one time,\u201d says learning strategies graduate assistant Ellen Dunn.\nSlow and steady learning has proven to work better for the brain as it changes and consolidates the new information.\n\u201c..changes in the brain allow for faster, stronger signalling between neurons as the brain gains new skills. But the best way to speed up those signals is to introduce new information to our noggins \u2014 slowly,\u201d explains Hadley Bergstrom, a neuroscientist.\nLearning in short burst allows links between neurons to steadily strengthen.\nThe next time you choose to learn how to play an instrument, code, paint, learn new technology, draw, or learn a new language, give yourself enough time to make real progress that lasts.\nDecide what you want, choose to learn in short bursts, make it easy to practice, and plan your breaks on purpose.

That includes both volumes, the executive summaries, the table of contents, and the appendices. While I didn\u2019t read the appendices word for word, I did a scan on just about every page. On top of reading the report, I also read some of the popular analysis on CNN and FoxNews, and I watched a few pundits discuss and debate the report. The following is my citizens summary of the Mueller report, of which I have broken down into six key takeaways.\nFirst, the Mueller report clearly explains that the office of the president is no longer important because almost no one actually listens to or does what the president says. In other words, America is able to function without a president.\nSecond, the report clearly paints Washington D.C. as the central bank for global political capital, and therefore, foreign interests, corporate interests, religious interests, and anyone else that has an interest, uses D.C. as a place to vie for influence. In other words, Washington D.C. is the main venue for power brokers that work with the American political machine. According to the report, the capital of the United States is actually not functioning as the capital of the nation, but instead serves as a marketplace for trading favors and exchanging political capital. America is, therefore, functioning without a working capital city or a president.\nThird, President Donald Trump is paranoid, emotional, and makes rash decisions. He also does not listen to his advisors. Trump is convinced that many people are out to get him, and he believes this because he thinks that he has superpowers. Trump is effectively a little boy who was told by his mother that he is special, and therefore he needs to be careful of other people who will be jealous of his specialness.\nFourth, Trump tried to illegally stop a perfectly valid investigation that was looking at Russian meddling into US elections, however, no one followed the president's orders. Trump was, therefore, unable to commit the crimes that he intended to because no one listened to him. Trump may go down in history as one of the most ineffective gangsters in America. Trump may also become the first dictator of America, as the report clearly illustrates his propensity for dishonor and seizing power.\nFifth, President Trump and his family committed no crime or conspiracy regarding collusion during or after the election. Jared Kushner largely dismissed the Russian attempt at influencing the Trumps as a waste of time. The primary reason that no crime was committed was because the Russians didn\u2019t actually have anything of value to offer the Trumps. The report describes a situation however where the Trumps probably would have committed a crime if the Russians did, in fact, have something to offer.\nSixth, and most importantly, is that people need to let go of political concern, and stop enabling the media to create a political shit show for entertainment purposes. The Mueller report clearly describes a political environment where the entire federal government system is corrupt, broken, and staffed by droves of lunatics driven only by their own self-interests. The report also makes it clear that Trump is not unique, and therefore if you don\u2019t like Donald Trump, you also shouldn\u2019t like anyone else in Washington D.C.\nIn summary, the Mueller report tells Americans that their federal government is broken and needs to replaced.\n", "claps": "120 claps", "author": "Dop Mania", "comments": ["Amusing, I was expecting something a bit more like a summary though.", "I think a review of facts tends to get lost on people, many of whom already have an opinion.

The clumsy, incompetent son of the famous Corleone crime family says that Eric Trump, second child of President Donald Trump, aka Donnie Bratso, aka The Orange Godfather, has been assuming all of his inept, ham-fisted characteristics without asking permission.\nThe Corleone scion, who lived for most of his career in Las Vegas managing the family\u2019s gambling interests, is demanding $200 million from the Trump family in \u201cpersonal damages and accumulated royalty fees.\u201d\nSpeaking from his rundown room at The Sands Hotel, Fredo added, \u201cThis move by Eric Trump was very uncool.

Usually, it is at that point when we think we have no options that our lives take radical turns.\nMy little girl was sick. I was flat out of money and my wife was an hysterical nagging mess. I couldn\u2019t blame her, what\u2019s a man when he\u2019s got no money? Of what use is a vegetable of a human being that can\u2019t even save the life of the one he loves.\n\u201cYou don\u2019t love us!\u201d She cried.\n\u201cWhat am I to do? There are no jobs. The last foreman robbed me off my wages and I broke his nose in anger. Maybe I shouldn\u2019t have but a man can only take so much from a fellow Jew. If Romans treat us like shit, should we do the same to our kin too?\u201d\n\u201cEnough sermonising Tobias, If you channelled half the fire in you towards getting funds to treat our Hannah instead of brawling with your colleagues and losing jobs, that would be fine. Instead you just \u2013\u201d\n\u201cEnough of this already woman!\u201d\n\u201cNo! It would be enough when you actually do something useful. Our daughter is dying Tobias, do something!\u201d\nI\u2019d had enough. There\u2019s no winning her, especially when she\u2019s right. I needed to do something fast if I didn\u2019t want to lose our daughter to some illness that a few shekels of silver would cure. If her nagging was unbearable at that point, then I couldn\u2019t imagine how it would be if something terrible happened to Hannah. She\u2019s the last flicker of light in our gloomy home and anything other than a recovery would break us in half.\nI needed to do something. I had to see Sirach.\nWe grew up together \u2013 brothers of necessity after our home in Samaria was sacked, our fathers killed and mothers taken off as slaves. We looked after each other, stealing what we could and surviving any way we could. In time, we grew to be known for pulling off some of the most dangerous heists in the city of Jerusalem. I only did what I could to survive but Sirach however had grander plans to rise and control some portion of the game. I was to help him, offering counsel while he called the shots and found others to get their hands dirty on our behalf. We would have been big time bosses...\nBut I met Edna, fell in love, and got married.\nI hadn\u2019t seen Sirach since I left with Edna. She made me turn my back on who I once was and I\u2019m eternally grateful that I could know some semblance of peace. But like a dog going back to its vomit, I needed to call a brother from my past to help me out. When you have a child born out of love, there\u2019s nothing you wouldn\u2019t do to save her.\n*******************\n\u201cSo you could show up after all these years. Funny how others seem so appealing when you need help, even after walking away from them because of some whore from Samaria.\u201d Sirach said with a smirk.\nI couldn\u2019t escape his scathing tongue, not if I hoped to get his help. He took it on the wrong side when I left to build a family and the passage of time didn\u2019t appear to have softened him one bit.\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry Sirach. I don\u2019t expect you to understand but I fell in love and had to make sacrifices. I\u2019m sorry I had to turn my back on the life we had built and the dreams we had but I needed to do what I did.\u201d\n\u201cYou don\u2019t just turn your back on one family to build another, Tobias. I\u2019m not saying you shouldn\u2019t have found love but you messed up brother. I know you need my help now but here\u2019s my answer before you even tell me what\u2019s going on and what you want from me. No.\u201d\n\u201cBut Sirach...\u201d\n\u201cGet out Tobias, you\u2019re not welcome here.\u201d\nI felt defeated. Sirach doesn\u2019t dally. When he says something he means it and even I couldn\u2019t change his mind back then without a lot of prodding. So what hope did I have when I\u2019d walked out on him years ago, leaving sour grapes behind to ferment and stink up the situation?\nI turned and walked towards the exit, imagining the look of anguish on Edna\u2019s face and the hopelessness of Hannah.\n\u201cWait!\u201d\nI stopped and turned.\n\u201cThere\u2019s something I can do to help but you don\u2019t have family privileges anymore so it wouldn\u2019t be for nothing. We just might need your skills in pulling off a job at some Roman\u2019s home in the heart of the city. I know your daughter\u2019s sick but you should also have kept in touch. Do this and you would have enough to take care of her and substantial change to make something of yourself. Go with Baruch here, he\u2019ll fill you in. It\u2019s tonight. I only hope you haven\u2019t gotten rusty but I need not worry; you\u2019re a natural.\u201d\nI heaved a sigh of relief but the worry didn\u2019t still leave my face. To save Hannah, I have dip myself into the murky pit I climbed out of years ago.\n************\nWe got in easy. Sirach\u2019s men learnt from the best and their planning as well as execution was flawless. Baruch\u2019s and the others already had the guards in the problem areas subdued and I was left to unlock the door to the treasury and avoid whatever booby traps lay in our path to the treasure.I\u2019d never seen so much unique stones in my life. Baruch said just one piece was worth a fortune and we had packed five bags to go with. Light enough to ensure we moved fast, worth enough to have us pretty much made for life and I began to envisage a quick recovery for my Hannah and a comfortable life afterwards.\nBut that was when everything went to shit.\nUnknown to us, the guards that were relieved of duty were still within the premises, having a warm bath and fooling around with the maids. When they were moving out, one of them noticed that the replacements that had been subdued by Baruch and the others were not at their posts. We couldn\u2019t run without putting up a fight. It was bloody, and by the time it was over, Baruch was dead with most of the men, two others escaped with some of the loot.\nI was knocked unconscious and by the time I came to, I was chained up in a dungeon with some guy named Joab who told me everything that happened.Life was pretty much over for me. Robbing a Roman is punishable by death at the worst and slavery at best, but Baruch killed two guards so I could only hope for the former. I was going to die but it would have been fine because I did what I could to save my daughter.\nHowever, nothing broke me more than when Edna showed up in a week later \u2013 puffy eyed from crying \u2013 to tell me that Hannah died two days earlier because she didn\u2019t have any money to get her to the physician.\n***************\nPain.\nIntense, constant throbbing shot up my feet and hands but I couldn\u2019t do a single thing about it. I thought the whips were bad. I thought I would pass out and just die but I didn\u2019t. Death would have been a mercy I didn\u2019t deserve yet after all that had happened.\nI looked over to my left. Joab seemed to be oblivious to what I was going through and was busy yelling curses at the Romans and anyone in sight from his new pedestal.\n\u201cCalm down Joab, save your strength.\u201d\n\u201cFor what exactly; to just hang here like some scarecrow in a farm for people to point at and kids to stone? No, I\u2019ll rather go with a bang than a whimper. Let these Romans know they didn\u2019t break this Jew like they have done the others.\u201d\nIn the few days I spent with him, I realised Joab couldn\u2019t be reasoned with so I let him be. Beyond the physical pain I endured, I could never get the thought of Hannah\u2019s loss out of my mind. It tortured me. I hoped to see her again but how\u2019s that even possible with what I did? As the scriptures said, I would end up in Sheol while my innocent child would be with Yahweh.\nThen they brought him. Somehow, from high up he seemed different. He didn\u2019t fight or stare down the Romans when they whipped him. He let them do whatever they wanted \u2013 even when they stripped him down and cast lots to share his clothing. In a way, there was some inevitability about him, like he wanted them to do it.\nHe said nothing.\nWhen they nailed him and raised him to be between us, he just hung his head and breathed slowly, waiting for the end to come. When he said he was thirsty some soldiers fixed a sponge soaked in cheap wine to him on a stalk of hyssop and further mocked him.\n\u201cHe fed thousands and healed scores. He saved others, let him save himself.\u201d\nThat was when it hit me. This was the Galilean everyone had told stories about. If only I had sought him out to save Hannah when I heard he was in Jerusalem instead of going to Sirach. But he looked so ordinary beside me that it was hard to believe he had as much power as people ascribed to him.Seeing a new target he could mock despite being in the same situation, Joab began to direct his insults at the Galilean.\n\u201cAren\u2019t you the Messiah they say you are? Save yourself and us!\u201d\nI didn\u2019t know what made me speak but it felt right standing up for someone. Joab was a killer and had no right to say the things he did.\n\u201cDon\u2019t you fear God? You received the same sentence as this man but we did what we did. We deserve our place here but this man, I doubt it. He has done no wrong!\u201d\nI looked at the Galilean, still silent with his head bent, his eyes focused on a few women below and a young lad he would later address as John.\u201cRemember me Jesus, when you come as King!\u201d\nJesus raised his head, smiled at me and said, \u201cI promise you that today, you will be in Paradise with me.\u201d\nAt about midday, the sun stopped shining and a strange darkness enveloped the countryside for a few hours and the earth shook violently. Suddenly, Jesus cried out and died. Some hours later, I closed my eyes and succumbed to the kind of gloom that shrouded the city. I died.\nI thought it was over. But when a strange kind of bright light washed over me like the sun does when someone opens the curtain covering your window, I stirred awake. I looked around and realised I wasn\u2019t alone. A multitude of bodies began to float, as I did towards the source of the light that I later knew to be Jesus. His face shining brighter than the day ever did, adorned with that same smile he cast upon me on the cross before we died.\nThat was when I understood what was going on.\nDying he destroyed our death, rising he restored our life.\nThe darkness was no more. I was going to live again; I was going to see my little Hannah.\n****************************************\n3AM. Lagos, Nigeria.\nI\u2019d just had the strangest dream and it was as if I\u2019d seen it before. Nursing a cup of water while trying to figure out what it was all about, I couldn\u2019t shake the feeling that I needed to write about it and try to recreate what I\u2019d seen before it became clear.\nI sat down at my desk, set my glass down and welcomed the shiny grin of my computer coming to life. The first thing my out-of-hibernation computer displayed as I unlocked it stopped me for a bit. But it wasn\u2019t bad at all; if anything, I knew I needed to write and I know exactly what I had to share.\n\u201cThe Gospel according to Luke...\u201d\nI smiled, closed the window, opened up Microsoft Word and began to type.\nGolgotha...\nTHE END\n", "claps": "228 claps", "author": "Deoye Falade", "comments": [], "link": "https://medium.com/@deoyefalade/golgotha-235aa8373f35"}, {"title": "31-Day Writing Challenge: 2019 \u2013 The Every Day Novelist \u2013 Medium", "num_comments": "unspecified", "tags": [], "reading_time": 3, "text": "I am so, so excited!

Everyone loves pizza. It\u2019s fast and easy. The demand is high. It\u2019s the classic American staple. But you\u2019ve got a ton of competitors, marketing is tougher than you thought, rent is getting higher, the app designs are stale, every week is a 52-week low, and it\u2019s getting harder to differentiate\u2014you know, the typical stuff. So, you think to yourself, \u201cI need to do something nobody has ever done before. Something new, something progressive.\u201d You start brainstorming ideas and come up with a brilliant one that sounds something like, \u201cSo then you could view the pizza details and swipe right if you like it and swipe left if you don\u2019t. Kind of like Tinder, but for pizza!\u201d\nYeah, no. You cannot design something like that, because Tinder has a patent on the interaction of swiping right to like and left to dislike. \u201cOkay, okay, fine,\u201d you say to yourself. \u201cThat is the hallmark of its entire app, so then just get rid of the swipe feature, and we\u2019ll make a minimum viable product (MVP) solution of just having a \u2018like\u2019 and \u2018dislike\u2019 button at the bottom.\u201d Tough luck, kid. Tinder has a patent on that, too.\nDesigners are always looking at how other companies solve similar design challenges and use them as inspiration for ideas. It\u2019s a fun (and sometimes not so fun) process that can even cause others to criticize you for not doing enough research if you don\u2019t look at a competitor\u2019s solutions. For designers and nondesigners alike, it\u2019s important to understand which designs are off-limits for use as inspiration. Companies take a lot of time to think up product-defining UI elements, so it makes sense that they don\u2019t want others copying something they\u2019ve spent a lot of energy creating. These UI features can be as detailed as Apple\u2019s iPhone X home-button-less navigation, for which it filed a giant patent that\u2019s still in review, or as small as Facebook\u2019s \u201clike\u201d icon.\nIt can take one to two years for design patents and up to five years for utility patents.\nThe ballpark overall cost for a design patent is $2,000 to $3,000. Unlike other types of patents, yearly maintenance fees are not required. If you\u2019re a big company, this is pretty cheap.\nAll of the patents listed in this article last about 15 years.\nConveniently, you can find them on Google Patents, which indexes them from more than 100 patent offices around the world. You can search by type, keywords, or company, because patents are all public material. If you ever have the time, it\u2019s a good idea to look through patents once in a while.\nAccording to UpCounsel, \u201cthe only section in a patent that is legally enforceable\u201d is written in the claim, which is limited to one sentence. For non-design patents, it makes sense to hit up the claims section first. In design patents, that one sentence is often vague and reads something like, \u201cThe ornamental design for a display panel of a programmed computer system with a graphical user interface, as shown and described,\u201d which is not very helpful. Therefore, the parts to pay attention to are the solid lines in the attached drawings. The dotted lines are just supporting details to show you what environment it appears in, like if it\u2019s mobile or desktop. The dotted lines can also be contextual, which helps you know, for example, that something is scrolled or if it specifically appears in a messaging app. The title will also tell you if the patented item is an animation or a graphical interface. Unfortunately, patents usually don\u2019t include a description of how the thing is supposed to work\u2014sometimes a bit of guessing is involved.\nYou can patent:\nYou cannot patent:\nSometimes you can find a company\u2019s hidden plans while looking at patents. I found a couple of blueprints for designs that are not yet in a product (if it ever does at all). Which makes sense, because the insurance for a patent lasting 15 years costs less than one year of auto insurance. To a company, that\u2019s essentially free insurance\u2014and if it finds an opportunity to sue someone for copying its designs, that\u2019s free money. Samsung is probably well aware of this: In 2018, the company held 61,608 active patent families\u201434% more than second-place Canon, which held 34,905 patent families. Companies will patent any half-decent idea it legally can, with the full expectation that many of those ideas won\u2019t ever make it to production\u2014but might just pay off in litigation.\nWe\u2019re so used to seeing the slide-to-unlock pattern that it might feel surprising that such a ubiquitous pattern is locked in (pun intended) by Apple. Back when slide to unlock launched, this was a pretty new idea, so it makes sense that Apple wanted to mark it as theirs, and rightfully so. I\u2019d imagine that this patent covers most horizontal slide-to-unlock designs. Now, this doesn\u2019t mean you can\u2019t design a pattern where you slide to unlock. It just means that if you do, it needs to look significantly different. There was a big legal case where Samsung had to pay Apple $120 million for having a similar design.\nWhen tapping on a folder of icons, icons in the folder get displayed in an expanded state below. The double outline on the selected folder and the arrow on the expanded state are both integral design elements to this patent.\nChat UIs all tend to follow a similar-enough pattern, which is why this patent is particularly important. It looks like Apple decided its message bubbles were an iconic part of the user experience, so make sure you don\u2019t copy their shape with the little tail on the last message, and find a way to differentiate your chat interface.\nThis bad boy is off-limits. You can only use the Touch ID icon in situations such as a mockup with a modal asking for your fingerprint ID that uses Apple\u2019s native features. You can\u2019t use this icon on your version of your eCommerce iOS app in the login field, for example. I actually did that once and got called out by my client who knew better, so I learned this one the hard way. To be honest, it\u2019s a great icon\u2014nice and circular, so you aren\u2019t forced to work with that weird long fingerprint shape. Good job, Apple.\nAs voice UIs become more of a design trend, people will surely look toward existing UIs like Siri, Alexa, and Google Assistant for inspiration. Apple took the initiative to patent the visualization when voice is transcribed from human to machine, which takes the appearance of a colorful array of waves.\nThis patent covers the styling of the \u201clike\u201d button and any animation that comes with it. Pretty straightforward. The patent does not dictate exactly how the \u201clike\u201d button animates, so Facebook could still change the design in the future.\nGiven all the patents around these floating icons, it\u2019s apparent that Facebook put a lot of attention and resources into its livestreaming services. This was also around the time Twitter\u2019s Periscope and Instagram Live were getting popular. When the user selects an icon/emoji on the horizontal panel during a livestream, their emoji has an animated bubbling effect that\u2019s visible to other viewers. This was an interesting project from Facebook, since you could see other people\u2019s reactions in real time as a timeline rather than the traditional ticking number. Facebook has patents for emojis that float up and for emojis that float horizontally. It seems that none of these patents are being used in production today, but Facebook still created patents for all the different versions for testing purposes. The company created a variation of the floating emoji feature that rises from the center when the tap targets are in the center of the screen, plus another variation of the same concept but with the tap targets at the bottom of the screen.\nThis is a somewhat hidden, nice-to-have feature that adds a sense of personality to Facebook\u2019s brand.\nThis was a really clever solution on Facebook\u2019s part to consolidate the emojis that were present on the UI. Since reactions are such an integral part of the experience, it was important that Facebook emphasized the ability to react. Putting emojis in an expanded state leaves room for other actions, while the opportunity to show the fun and playful side with additional animations remains.\nFacebook has patents on simple screens such as the ones shown here, where the user creates a new post. It also has patents for the desktop version, which looks quite different when the user creates a new post. This is a new patent, granted in August 2018. The specific parts highlighted here are the icons and text at the bottom of the screen.\nThis patent was granted in November 2018 for a feature we have yet to see in production. By my guess, when scrolling through the comments for a specific post, an animation of the user\u2019s profile photo spins into view, and their reaction (in this example, the user hit \u201clike\u201d) also expands in size next to the user\u2019s profile. From these patent wireframes, it\u2019s unclear as to whose profile this belongs to. We don\u2019t know if these are reactions from other users that you can see in real time, or if it\u2019s an animation for an action that you took.\nI got really excited when I saw this feature, because, to my knowledge, it\u2019s not yet in production. Facebook has the rights to the layout of this design, in which the user can message restaurants and book a reservation. This patent was assigned back in 2017, so it\u2019s unclear if this is still in the works or if Facebook deprioritized it. Either way, it would be interesting to see this feature create competition with other booking apps like OpenTable, Resy, and Yelp.\nThis pattern of rectangles became the hallmark of Microsoft\u2019s core brand and is used on all Windows devices. When you click on the start menu on a desktop, you also get a small grid of options. When designing a dashboard, make sure you don\u2019t design something that is also just a bunch of rectangles resembling the layout in this patented wireframe.\nMicrosoft covered its butt by also patenting the mobile grid layout featured on Windows Phones. The unique part is the proportion and placement of these grids, which is off to the left, so there is space for a navigational icon on the top right. It seems, however, that this design is legacy. The current design (below, far right) has the grid filling the entire screen and can take up multiple columns. But you still couldn\u2019t do a rolled-back version like the original, because this patent is still active.\nI found this while looking through Microsoft\u2019s patents and thought it was a really clean design for a gallery. I\u2019ve used Windows for 25 years now, and I can\u2019t recall a time when I\u2019ve seen this layout used. I searched and asked around\u2014turns out it\u2019s the legacy Xbox 360 dashboard. I still wanted to include this because it\u2019s a cool layout, and someone else might end up designing a more modern version without realizing it\u2019s owned by the giant corporation called Microsoft. Yikes. It\u2019s a pretty old design \u2014 the patent was granted in 2010 \u2014 but you still can\u2019t do something like this until 2024, when the patent is expected to expire.\nRemember this? I always thought this design was kind of wack. But I\u2019m throwing it in here because I\u2019m surprised Snapchat still patented a circle among rectangles, which seems like a bit of overkill for this design. The company has since updated its UI to display a more unified grid.\nThe transition is subtle, but when you open a snap, it begins as a circle and fills the rectangle. If you pull the snap down slowly, you can see it go from a rectangle back into a circle and return to the user\u2019s profile area.\nSamsung has its own version of swipe to unlock, which is two arrows pointing inward. I wasn\u2019t able to find a mockup of this idea in play; it seems to have moved on to just the text hint for unlock.\nNetflix has really brought the carousel game to the next level and has done a ton of work to nail down the hover experience. When you hover over a show, the image expands, a video clip starts playing, and the essential details are displayed. The hover state also pushes other carousel items outward to make space for the expanded state. This is a very bold design: Netflix decided to strip out all information to avoid bombarding the user. The consequence of this design is that the title of each film or show has to be present and legible on each card. Netflix as a brand has valued the personality of the content over the unity and consistency of title placement. This is a new patent, granted in February 2018.\nBecause I don\u2019t use Netflix very often, I didn\u2019t realize this existed until I was doing my research. When you hover over an item, a clickable arrow appears. On click, it gives you a larger preview of the show. There are also more tabs with details of the show. This is a nice system that allows for progressive reveals on multiple levels. This patent was granted in March 2018.\nDesigners love Airbnb. It has some of the cleanest designs, and the company\u2019s work is an inspiration to all. Airbnb designers were some of the folks who really took the idea of \u201cdesign and experience first\u201d to heart and got others to follow suit. The company has been leading the industry with design-first thinking, because it\u2019s hard for existing businesses to change their working models, and, well, you can\u2019t exactly get executives to learn about design in a day.\nFor this patent, it took me a long time to decipher what exactly Airbnb has patented. Airbnb says that when a floating panel is set in this orientation on the screen (to the right of its grid), the company has rights on the animation that occurs when the user scrolls. If you look closely, there is an expanded area \u2014 \u201cGreat price\u201d \u2014 that appears when you scroll. This is a new patent that was granted in November 2018.\nThis patent is also new, granted in October 2018. The design seems to be rather generic: tabs at the top and some mosaic orientation of images, with the potential for a price label. It\u2019s unclear from the look of this design if it\u2019s a sneak peek at an upcoming experience, a return home page design, or a different page somewhere in the experience that I can\u2019t find. Be careful when replicating a pattern like this since it\u2019s pretty generic.\nYou might be able to get away with a swipe right to dislike and swipe left to like, but in the patent diagram, only the cards are solid lines (the \u201cliked\u201d part is a dotted line), which makes me think that any pattern of swiping left and right would be difficult to justify. Either way, if you try something like this and end up getting fingers pointed at you, you might have to fight the hazy lines of legal.\nSorry, but Tinder made sure you couldn\u2019t do that MVP (which stands for minimum viable product, also understood as \u201cokay, we don\u2019t have time, so let\u2019s scrap the cool stuff and go with the bare bones\u201d) version.\nThe look of having multiple profile circles underneath your own, matched with a list of contacts and a button, is reserved for Tinder. This is a pretty specific layout.\nIt\u2019s fun to learn which UI elements companies deem part of their core brand and which might not be entirely obvious to the casual consumer. More important, as designers, it\u2019s important for us to be well-read on which patterns are off-limits. Obviously, we aren\u2019t looking to directly copy experiences, but having that knowledge in our back pocket can be handy when talking with nondesigners.\nCompanies like Uber basically have every screen in their experiences patented, and other companies like Google have way too many to even begin to digest. I encourage you to do some research yourself on companies that you\u2019re taking inspiration from.\nAfter doing this work, I learned that patents can be incredibly small, like the shape or placement of an icon. They can also be generic and vague, like a group of rectangles with a certain proportion and orientation. Patents can also be detailed and descriptive, like Netflix\u2019s progressive reveal on its carousel.\nSo, if you\u2019re a UI/UX product designer trying to make it big, you have to familiarize yourself with existing patents. Just because you don\u2019t see it doesn\u2019t mean it doesn\u2019t exist!\nAnd if you have something truly unique that is a hallmark of your company\u2019s product, consider creating a patent for your company with the help of the legal team. It\u2019s not that costly for the company, especially since a patent lasts 15 years. And hey, nothing says \u201cdon\u2019t fuck with me\u201d more than having your own patent.\n", "claps": "4.5K claps", "author": "Christie Tang", "comments": ["My mind is playing this out to a logical conclusion: the largest tech companies could, theoretically, patent the \u201cbest\u201d UI patterns, leaving everyone else to be forced to design, well, crap (from the standpoint of usability and delight).

It dismisses the user\u2019s current screen and brings them back to their previous one. Users rely on this dismissive button as a safeguard to prevent them from making unwanted changes to the system.\nTo make your users feel safe, the Cancel button should signify a fallback to safety, not a call to action. This is why Cancel buttons should never have a color.\nColor on buttons signal a call to action. A Cancel button is not a call to action because no changes to the system occur after it\u2019s pressed. Therefore, you should never emphasize it with color, otherwise you\u2019ll give users that impression. Instead, they should get the impression that no changes occur and that the button is their escape commitment.\nThe Cancel button should have a neutral color to signify the neutral, non-committal button. When users notice that the Cancel button is without color, they\u2019ll recognize it as the fallback to safety quicker. This is essential for users who activate a confirmation screen by mistake and want a quick escape.\nWhen each button on a screen has a color, they\u2019re competing for attention. This causes users to ponder each action longer. A neutral colored Cancel button makes it faster for them to decide by not competing. Users who are prepared to take action won\u2019t get distracted by the Cancel button.\nNot all Cancel buttons are labeled \u201cCancel,\u201d but they function the same as one. For example, a Cancel button could have the label, \u201cNot Now\u201d, \u201cNo Thanks\u201d, \u201cMaybe Later\u201d, or \u201cSkip\u201d depending on the context. If the button has a dismissive behavior, you should treat it as a Cancel button because it serves the same function.\nThe more buttons there are on a screen, the more necessary a clear escape is. When all buttons have a color, the escape isn\u2019t clear. But when the Cancel button is a neutral color, it makes the button choices more intuitive.\nWhen using gray on a button, it\u2019s important to make the gray dark enough. Otherwise the button isn\u2019t legible and may look like it\u2019s in a disabled state.\nTo ensure your button is legible, check the color contrast with a WCAG 2.0 contrast ratio tool such as Contrast Checker. This will tell you if the gray you\u2019re using passes the accessibility guidelines for color.\nMost of the time when users activate a confirmation screen, they\u2019re ready to take action. But for the times they activate it by mistake or change their mind about taking action, the Cancel button needs to offer safety.\nA colored Cancel button sends out the wrong signals. It causes users to perceive it as a call to action instead of a fallback to safety. Neutralize your Cancel button so users have an easier time using your confirmation screen.\nOriginally published at https://uxmovement.com on March 27, 2019.\n", "claps": "373 claps", "author": "UX Movement", "comments": [], "link": "https://medium.com/@uxmovement/why-cancel-buttons-should-never-have-a-color-6ce7e763d7f1"}, {"title": "7 Tips To Organize Colors for UI Design \u2013 UX Planet", "num_comments": "unspecified", "tags": ["ux design", "ui", "ui design", "design", "ux"], "reading_time": 6, "text": "Colors matter. Colors are one of the most important building blocks of any interface (along with typography and space). They have a tremendous effect on the overall perception of a digital product.\nIt's vital to structure colors. If you don\u2019t structure colors, you can find overwhelmed by how many colors you use by the time you reach the end of the design project.\nBuilding a consistent system of colors \u2014 reducing the number of used colors, and eliminating unnecessary duplicates seemed like the right thing to do. But how to achieve this goal?\nHere are seven practical tips for structuring colors in a new design project:\nAn interface inventory is a procedure of categorizing the components making up your app or website. Interface inventory will show how many colors you use in your product.\nIf you\u2019re working on a website, use a tool like CSS Stats to see how many unique colors you have in your style sheets.\nIf you\u2019re creating an inventory in Sketch, use the Sketch-Style-Inventory plugin to aggregate all colors. You will be able to merge similar styles.\nFor existing products, it\u2019s also recommended to check the number of times each color is actually used in code. By doing that you\u2019ll notice that some of the colors are used in many different places, while others are used only once. The insight you get will help you organize your palette.\nIf you\u2019re working for an established brand, most probably the brand has an established brand palette of colors.\nYou can\u2019t go creative with brand colors because by doing that you\u2019ll deviate from brand guidelines.\nTry to use brand colors for UI elements that make the structure of your design \u2014 headers, footers, menus, etc.\nIf your brand color works both for light and dark background, you can use it as a layout color for your design.\nWhen it comes to selecting whites and blacks, it\u2019s always better not to choose extreme versions of colors. White doesn\u2019t have to be absolute white (#FFFFFF). Similar to that, black doesn't have to absolute black.\nDepending on how strict you want to be with your color palette, you may want to include a range of tints (a color mixed with white) and shades (a color mixed with black). But be careful! Having too many tints and shades can make the procedure of color selection harder for designers.\nLow contrast neutral colors are bad for elements that require reading but absolutely fine for elements like input fields. Input fields don\u2019t need to stand out very much so low contrast neutral color can help you create a perfect UI container.\nIdeally, you should have a small number of approved primary colors (1\u20133 primaries that represent your brand) and a sufficient number of accent colors.\nInteractive colors are colors that we use for interactive elements \u2014 buttons, links, and other UI controls that users can click or touch.\nIf possible, try to use only one color as your primary interactive color. By doing that you\u2019ll help your user memorize this color.\nYou can create lighter and darker versions of your interactive color. Color shades can help you convey different states for your UI elements \u2014 for example, a pressed state/hover state.\nColor can be a helpful wayfinding tool for your users. It\u2019s a good idea to use the same color for links and buttons. By doing that you help your users to recognize interactive elements.\nDenotive colors are colors that mean something. You\u2019ll need to have colors for states such as error, warning, and success.\nUse a share of red to indicate the error state. If one of your brand colors happen to be red, it\u2019s better to avoid using it for error messages. Why? Because by doing that you make users associate your brand color with problems.\nUse a shade of green to indicate success state. If one of your brand colors is green, it\u2019s absolutely fine to use it for success state. Users will associate your brand color with a positive outcome.\nIdeally, you should have only one color for error and another for success. But be sure that colors you choose for error and success work both for low and high- contrast backgrounds.\nDisabled state is traditionally grayed out. Usually, designers use low opacity color for that. One crucial moment that you should remember when selecting disabled state color \u2014 make sure the color has enough contrast, so it\u2019s readable for your users.\nIf you\u2019re saving your colors in the design system, make sure to give clear names for each color you use. Color names should be both easily understood and memorable. Both designers and developers should be able to easily refer to particular colors defined in the system.\nTry to avoid using gradation of adjectives (lightBlue, darkBlue); use functional names instead \u2014 names that describe the color by the place in the UI.\nCreate accessible color palettes so people who are color blind be able to use your products.\nThere are a variety of color contrast checkers you can use to ensure your color palette works for everyone who will use your products.\nIn some cases, modifying existing colors won\u2019t create any problems, in others, you might break the entire UI. That\u2019s why the color palette that you create and apply for UI must be carefully tested.\nWhile it's possible to use visual regression tools for that purpose, you can achieve much better results by conducting manual testing.\nIf you\u2019re in the process of finding the right colors for your project, here is a collection of tools that can help you with:\nFollow UX Planet: Twitter| Facebook\n", "claps": "458 claps", "author": "Nick Babich", "comments": [], "link": "https://uxplanet.org/7-tips-to-organize-colors-for-ui-design-97bbefed8a8a"}, {"title": "Steal Your Way to a High Performance Landing Page \u2013 Hacker Noon", "num_comments": "unspecified", "tags": ["marketing strategies", "saas marketing", "landing pages", "ppc marketing", "marketing"], "reading_time": 8, "text": "The first time I was asked to create a landing page for a software product I had no clue what the page has to look like.\nThree years passed before I gained some confidence at launching something. During that time, I studied every website I could find and worked hard on building one that would make selling as easy as possible. The first thing I started with an analysis of competitors.\nIn this post, I\u2019m going to share my observations and ideas that were found on our competitors\u2019 websites during the last three years.\nIn our project, we constantly change our landing pages and create additional pages for our products to maximize ROI.\nHowever, it is not always clear what I have to change, and what kind of A/B test I have to run. That is why I always keep my eyes on competitors. And I will provide the analysis of their pages below. For the analysis, I take 20 landing pages of our direct competitors.\nA couple of words about our company. We produce desktop photo editing software for Mac and PC. It\u2019s important \u2014 a desktop software product for photographers.\nIn our business, a landing page is probably the most important part of the website or particular marketing activity. Usually, there are up to 5 key elements that make it work. I used to think about a landing as a blank canvas so putting some elements on it have to attract visitors.\nFirst of all, a landing page must drive interest, inspire and explain what a product is about. Furthermore, there are some other things it has to do:\nEverything has to be done in a very short period of time.\nUnfortunately, there is no magic wand to craft a perfect landing page. But my goal is to highlight and test a specific set of elements, which are constantly used by the majority of competitors. I hope the analysis and my findings inspire you to try something new on your websites.\nThe list is ranked by Alexa index:\nThe factors that are described below are important for my particular case and may not be the same for your tasks. In any case, everyone needs proofs on daily disputes with colleagues.\nThe list of elements:\nTitle, Description, Call-to-action on the first screen, Free Trial, Register to get a Free trial, Price on a page, Product advantages, Features list, Interactive elements, Video, Screenshots, Before-after photos, Header, Fixed header, Footer, Any social proofs, Customers\u2019 feedback, Awards.\nThe final table looks like that:\nWith the help of collected information, let\u2019s determine how often each particular element is used.\nThere are several interesting statistical facts:\nI don\u2019t have specific conversion rates for any of the pages, so I can\u2019t define which element works (statistically). However, the goal of this analysis is to define the list of ideas. This information is more than enough to accomplish that.\nSo, here are my key findings:\nShort and memorable title forms visitors\u2019 expectations. It must emphasize product advantages and differentiate a product from competitors.\nHere are some competitors\u2019 examples:\nPractically, I was not able to statistically prove the impact on a conversion rate of a title. The factor is certainly important, but changing it slightly, the impact can\u2019t be revealed, and I am afraid to make radical changes.\nA free trial button dramatically reduces sales conversion rate for people who are familiar with the product. At the same time, the lack of a button makes it impossible to acquire new customers.\nFinding the compromise is a big deal not only for the landing page optimization but for the product in a general. The majority of competitors uses the trial model on their pages, which forms customer habits. It is difficult to convince to buy a software product without giving a try.\nHere are some competitors\u2019 examples:\nThese tests are endless, but the optimal model can exist: create two separate landing pages for new visitors and for visitors who are familiar with the product. Based on my findings, new visitors get a trial and the others react to the \u201cBuy now\u201d button.\nAdobe works this way. Their home page changes when the visitor is logged in:\nAlmost all our competitors (85%) pages contain a call-to-action on the first screen, that can seriously affect a conversion rate. It is definitely worth testing.\nHere are some competitors\u2019 examples:\nMy tests showed that pages with a single Call-to-action work better than pages with multiple buttons, for example: \u201cBuy\u201d and \u201cTry now\u201d simultaneously.\n70% of competitors show a detailed list of their products\u2019 features. The exception is Adobe Lightroom, which doesn\u2019t need an explanation. Before your product is so popular and most visitors already know how it works, you need to explain your product features.\nThere are many different ways to explain what the product is about: screenshots, videos, interactive elements and more.\nSurprisingly, most pages (65%) do not use any form of social proofs. It is important to test the impact of reviews, awards, ratings and other forms of social proofs. This can be a great way to differentiate from competitors as a customer oriented company.\nHere are some competitors\u2019 examples:\nIt is important to remember that the idea that works for me may not be appropriate for your goals. Moreover, different types of traffic, optimization methods will show different results. This is only the list of ideas, which deserve have to be tested. And so the final list is:\nI hope my analysis inspires you to make some improvements on your websites. Before making any changes, analyze your current behavior data to make a meaningful comparison with future changes.\n", "claps": "65 claps", "author": "Vasyl Sergienko", "comments": [], "link": "https://hackernoon.com/steal-your-way-to-a-high-performance-landing-page-149ea067520d"}, {"title": "Why I Had Sex in Public \u2013 traceybyfire \u2013 Medium", "num_comments": "unspecified", "tags": [], "reading_time": 3, "text": "Some people have sex in public for excitement, but my ex and I had far more utilitarian reasons.

Her parents sit in the kitchen, smirking over coffee. Is she having sex up there? Did a serial killer break into the house?\nNo, she just got accepted into college.\nYou\u2019ve watched the scene a hundred times. TV commercials. Movies starring Liam Neeson or Bruce Willis as the father.\nThis is how we\u2019re trained to react to good news. As if we\u2019ve just had mind-blowing sex. Frankly, it\u2019s a problem.\nSuccess doesn\u2019t always feel like that. But we expect it to. That\u2019s why I felt so strange when my tenure letter arrived. The official one. I stood there for half a minute, waiting for the flood of ecstasy.\nIt didn\u2019t come. And neither did I.\nSo I said to myself, \u201cWeird,\u201d and finished making dinner. Since then I\u2019ve been wondering what success really feels like. Here\u2019s some thoughts.\nWe think we know how to feel and act after a big win. We don\u2019t. Not always. Not all of us. Sometimes it feels weird. Like you don\u2019t know what to do with yourself. And that\u2019s fine. Let yourself feel weird.\nAlmost everyone thinks they want a varsity jacket. We see them in the halls and imagine we\u2019ll feel different wearing one. So we run six miles every day for three years. Then the day comes. We make varsity.\nBut you know what? Making varsity changed nothing. You feel the exact same as you did yesterday. It\u2019s not that you feel cheated. You just didn\u2019t need that jacket as much as you thought. You still love running. It\u2019s still hard. Everyone still tells you to smile more.\nAnd the jacket itself looks kind of lame. Turns out, the school colors don\u2019t flatter us as much as we thought. You\u2019ll stick to your normal black and red. Maybe the coach asks why you never wear the jacket. You say you don\u2019t know. You don\u2019t want it to get dirty.\nThe first thing many of us want to do with our success is share it far and wide. You\u2019re supposed to do that, right? Everyone else does. Sometimes, maybe. But only if you want to. Some victories feel better in private.\nAsk yourself if scrolling through superficial \u201cCongratulations!\u201d messages from a hundred people you barely know will bring you any real joy.\nConsider why we always feel compelled to shout, as if the success itself isn\u2019t enough. Maybe it\u2019s because we didn\u2019t climax like an 18-year-old girl in a Liam Neeson movie, like we thought we would, and it bothers us.\nWe think maybe one of our friends will do it for us. Or at least they\u2019ll use enough emojis that we can imagine a real flood of emotion. But even the most masterful emoji arrangement can\u2019t help.\nMaybe you shouldn\u2019t force yourself to feel something that doesn\u2019t exist. Your best moments don\u2019t have to make you burst into song.\nFew events ever match the pure joy and excitement of waking up to find a bunch of wrapped boxes under a tree. We did almost nothing to earn them as kids. They were free. And so pretty.\nAnd then we grew up. Now we don\u2019t expect magical creatures to leave free shit under trees and pillows. But an expectation lingers.\nWe still hunger for the feeling. Instead of leaving out milk and cookies, we apply to elite colleges. We compete for awards. We go job hunting. Seek promotions. Submit things to publications. And we expect it all to bring the same Christmas morning feeling.\nImagine the labor and planning that went into your last success. You didn\u2019t just go to sleep one night and wake up to find a promotion under your pillow. You assembled it over time, piece by piece. You made it. Enjoying something you made feels different.\nYou\u2019re an adult now. You forget that sometimes.\nMaybe that Christmas morning feeling simply fades a little. Autonomy can be such a buzzkill. It feels good to earn something day by day. To watch something grow. But it\u2019s not the same feeling.\nWhat really floods over some of us is a feeling of relief. A victory can make you suddenly realize how much work you\u2019ve done.\nYou don\u2019t scream and bounce up and down because you\u2019re tired. You\u2019ve busted your ass for this accomplishment. For years. So maybe you\u2019re not going to pop open the champagne.\nMaybe you\u2019ll have some wine and go to bed early for once. You deserve to taste a life where you\u2019re not constantly hustling. And yet, you also know you may have to hustle once more. So you\u2019re going to enjoy a break.\nLots of us live for the viral moment. That\u2019s about as close to Christmas morning as some of us get anymore. Who hasn\u2019t gone to bed hoping they\u2019ll wake up to a huge spike in traffic on their site?\nSure, success can happen that way. But we\u2019ve forgotten that it\u2019s not crucial. You can just consistently produce quality content over a long stretch. You can sell a product that actually helps people.\nAnd you can be fine. You\u2019ll support yourself and your family. You\u2019ll do solid work that matters to you and others.\nSuccess isn\u2019t about the orgasm moment. And it\u2019s not about the bling. In my 20s, I used to display my plaques and diplomas and starred book reviews on the wall of my apartment. Inspiration, right?\nSoon after a string of wins, I fell into a web of struggle. Rejection still happened, on professional and personal fronts alike. The awards I felt so proud of started giving me a wicked case of claustrophobia. One of them even fell from its look and hit me.\nThe universe was telling me something. So I listened and unhung all the proof of my so-called talent. Stuck it in a closet. My mind began to clear. Like everyone says now, if it doesn\u2019t bring you joy... This idea applies to trophies, too. You wouldn\u2019t think so, but it does.\nSome of us don\u2019t want our past wins stifling our future.

And so, naturally, I scurried off to Google to find it, copy it, and paste it into my piece.\nThankfully, a thought slapped me across the face rather suddenly (The Muse is good for more than just inspiration):\nI\u2019m quoting Hemingway, but I don\u2019t really know that much about him, either his work generally or his thoughts on writing. Sure, I read The Old Man and the Sea in 9th grade. And I see the same three quotes of his peppered throughout Medium articles about writing. But I don\u2019t really know him as a writer very well. And it feels a little gross using a quote from him like this.\nSo I set out to actually read Hemingway.\nI found a couple little collections of his essays and letters and spent a few hours meandering through them, trying to understand an author who has almost become a caricature of himself \u2014 you know, the guy who wrote short, direct sentences and talked a lot about hunting big game and drinking.\nThankfully, I discovered someone much richer than that: a man who \u2014 unsurprisingly, in retrospect \u2014 was a far \u201cfuller\u201d character than I had realized, in his thinking and writing generally, but more specifically, in his approach to his art.\nWhat follows is a collection of my favorite quotes from the letters and essays of Ernest Hemingway on writing, along with my own brief thoughts on each. My hope is that they will provide a little more nuance in how we think about Hemingway the man and the craft of writing.\nGood writing is essentially descriptive, not moral.\nI suppose this implies that, as writers, we should, from time to time, to be flexible enough to stick our heads up our own...\nHope for the Muse to show but don\u2019t leave your dynamite at home.\nEvery writer should have a favorite word.\nWhenever I see this passage quoted, they always include the \u201cwrite one true sentence\u201d bit but tend to leave off the part about the fire and the orange peels. Which is strange because I think that\u2019s the most important part.\nI imagine Hemingway sitting at his desk, staring at his typewriter, trying to think of what advice to give aspiring writers. But he\u2019s stuck. Writer\u2019s block. He\u2019s procrastinating.\nSo he remembers that time when he tossed an orange peel into the fire and watched the blue flame emerge. That, at least, he knows is true. So that\u2019s where he begins his advice, literally. That was his one true sentence that lead to his now famous \u201cWrite one true sentence\u201d quote.\nAs writers we ought to be in the world and experiencing it\u2014not as a research project, but as a life well-lived.\nThey key to communicating emotion is to write about the action that precipitated it.\nQuite the challenge, Old Man.\nInspiration depends on deliberate restraint.\nAction is the remedy for helplessness.\nMinimalism of craft allows for freedom to see truly, and so, to make.\nIt\u2019s okay to have seasons and rhythms to your writing; it can\u2019t be summer all year long.\nThere\u2019s a lot here: That love and writing share the same engine.\nWhen you live, live. When you write, write.\nEven if there are no laws of prose writing, best to act as if there are.\nThere\u2019s a primal energy is framing writing as competition, as warfare.\nThe 99th percentile is non-linear.\nWrite for wonder.\nThere\u2019s a profound psychological truth here: Better to think of feeling as an effect rather than a cause.\nInteresting proposition: True writing necessitates personal tragedy, but personal tragedy can never be the topic of true writing.\nPerhaps nothing gives life more meaning than death. And yet, how many of us have the courage to write about death?\nLet them yip.\nHemingway is best know as a proponent of brevity and simplicity of writing.\nBut that\u2019s not quite true to the man himself or his writing.\nAfter spending an admittedly brief time reading his letters, essays, and other thoughts \u2014 many of which were about writing itself \u2014 I think Hemingway would rather be known as a proponent of essentialism.\nI imagine he would say something like this:\nMore than anything else, the writer is charged with being in the world, observing it carefully, and sharing the essence of his or her experience. That in an act tinged with more than a little of the miraculous, by distilling experience down to the naked essentials, the writer is able to create something universally true and beautiful.\n", "claps": "1.3K claps", "author": "Nick Wignall", "comments": ["Ah man, I thought that was \u201cscurried off to the off-licence to get alcohol\u201d! that would have been hilarious\u2026 did you mean to plant that seed?

They stayed there, flooding my eyes. I haven\u2019t been to Paris yet. Some days, I feel like I haven\u2019t been anywhere yet. And Notre Dame was burning, the art and architecture falling to the fire. I watched as the spire came down, as gargoyles fell into the flames. I will see Paris one day, but I won\u2019t see Notre Dame the way it was, and that breaks my heart.\nIt\u2019s done, and all is not lost. They will rebuild. Donations have been coming in from around the world to make sure it happens. But something interesting happened in the aftermath of this tragedy: social media \u201cexperts\u201d began weighing in with their opinion that if billionaires could so quickly donate funds for the recovery and restoration of Notre Dame, then they could really be saving the world by donating those funds instead to world hunger and climate change prevention initiatives.\nIt\u2019s just basic math. They have more than they need, and they are more than capable of spending their money in the way of their choosing. Of course, I haven\u2019t seen a breakdown of their total donations to know how they\u2019re allocating those funds. Many of them may very well contribute to helping with the global climate crisis or feeding the poor. I wouldn\u2019t know. But I do know that they have always had the capacity to help.\nWhat\u2019s unfortunate is that because many of us live paycheck-to-paycheck, we absolve ourselves of the responsibility for helping others within our means. It\u2019s the billionaires who need to save the world so we don\u2019t have to give a dollar or lift a finger and can feel morally superior to all of the rich elitists with their private planes and glittery lives.\nIt\u2019s easy to point a finger rather than to turn to our own budget at times when our conscience is pricking us to find a way to help in the world. We feel overwhelmed at the enormity of the task before us, and it seems easier just to say that the ones with the most money can make the most difference. In doing so, we forget that every single person\u2019s choice matters. If we were all to try, it would mean more than a one-time large donation of funds from a person of wealth. If we all kept trying, we could truly make a difference.\nBut when we assume that our one meager donation won\u2019t help, we often turn to blame and shaming others who we perceive as being frivolous with their funds, assuming we would do better if we had the chance. In all of the accusations around waste, Notre Dame is still marred by fire, and the humanitarian issues we claim to be concerned about are still ongoing problems. We feel better to vent about the choice than to empower ourselves to do what we can to help.\nThere\u2019s another issue that we\u2019re overlooking here, too, while we are busy discussing whether or not the restoration of Notre Dame makes sense in the grand scheme of things:\nIt\u2019s important to feed the hungry. Of course, it is. But art feeds us, too. It feeds our very souls. It\u2019s why tears filled my eyes when the art and architecture of Notre Dame burned. Maybe many of us will never stand in front of the structure, will never be able to afford that trip or care to even do so. But there was something about just knowing that it existed, that beautiful places exist where we can go and feed more than our bellies.\nAs a writer, I\u2019m fully aware that many people do not value what I do because they don\u2019t see its contribution to society in the same way other jobs are viewed. But I know, in my heart, that art is important. It gives us something to live for. Whether we\u2019re talking about a book we read or a song we heard or a painting we saw, art is part of what makes life worth living. It inspires us and gives us hope, and sometimes it\u2019s the rope that helps us hold on when nothing else is connecting.\nIt\u2019s not a choice, but it makes us feel better to say that billionaires could save the world if they wanted to, if their ethics matched our own. It\u2019s so much easier than acknowledging that we all have a responsibility to do what we can on whatever financial level we find ourselves. We don\u2019t have to be independently wealthy to start recycling or reduce our reliance on plastics. We don\u2019t have to be billionaires to carpool or find other ways of reducing carbon emissions. We don\u2019t have to be wealthy to help out a neighbor who is struggling or to find a worthy community organization to help others in a hard spot.\nThat\u2019s not the choice. The choice at hand is deciding that we all have a personal responsibility for doing what we can do and being a part of finding solutions for the problems we observe. It\u2019s not just on the billionaires to save us. It\u2019s on all of us.\nThe choice isn\u2019t between the beauty that makes life worth living and every humanitarian issue in existence. Both are important, although I realize that it\u2019s difficult to appreciate art without shelter and nutrition. Maslow\u2019s Hierarchy of Needs shows us the importance of those basic necessities, but I will never understate the importance of art, beauty, and inspiration that helps us survive the most difficult times in our lives.\nIt matters. It\u2019s all well and good to shout to the rafters that the rich are being morally irresponsible in the face of all the other issues in play, but maybe we should have taken that moment of silence for the destruction of Notre Dame before launching into a criticism of the people who were moved to save it.\nArt moves us, and that matters. It\u2019s important. To say that it isn\u2019t is to undermine every school art program inspiring children to keep going even when their lives are difficult. It undervalues every artist who pours their heart and soul into giving back with the gifts and resources that they have to resonate with those their art is meant to reach. It downplays the value of inspiration and hope in our lives, and it paints the issues in a dangerous either/or light that divides us rather than connecting us in our shared humanity.\nIt isn\u2019t a choice. We don\u2019t have to make that call. But we can choose to do our part to help in whatever way we can. It could be a dollar a month to a worthy cause or simply making more eco-conscious decisions. It could be giving our time when we don\u2019t have other resources to give. We can keep pointing fingers at the billionaires who could be doing so much better, but doing so won\u2019t change anything. They\u2019ve always been able to help more, but we\u2019ve always been able to help, too.\nIf we want to save more than art, maybe it\u2019s time we realize that it\u2019s not someone else\u2019s job to do it. Perhaps we can begin to empower ourselves to choose what cause calls to us and what we can do to help. Maybe even taking notice of our own internal conflict around saving Notre Dame can be that motivating factor that helps us move from a place of judgment to a place of empowerment to do what we can, when we can, and how we can to solve the issues that pull our own heartstrings.\nMeanwhile, Notre Dame will be rebuilt.

Long loading times can have a devastating impact on your application\u2019s conversion rates. On the other hand, optimising page load time leads to noticeable improvements in customer experience, conversion rates, SEO and ultimately, your product\u2019s success.\nSo let\u2019s say that you have recently built a website or a frontend application using a modern JS framework (Angular, React, VueJS etc.). How can we make sure that performance is not going to hold it back from success?\nFirst things first. We have to somehow gather some data. When it comes to measuring a frontend application\u2019s performance, the tools I trust the most are:\nBoth tools can help you keep track of all the major performance KPIs (Pagespeed Index, Time to Interactive, First Contentful Paint, etc.).\nLighthouse is included in your Chrome\u2019s dev-tools, and by analysing your website/web-app, it can give you some really useful hints on how to boost it up.\nWith Speedcurve you can have all these KPIs, plus the ability to monitor them across time.\nSo now that we are able to measure our success, let\u2019s move on with optimising the parts of our website that play the biggest role.\nImages are a key part of every website. On average, images make up for more than 60% of data that are loaded on web pages. Being such a critical component of almost all websites, image optimisation is, in my opinion, the most important, and perhaps the lowest hanging fruit.\nThe most important thing to check is that you are not using a bigger resolution than the one you really need. So you have to resize your images to fit exactly the requirements of your layout.\nFurthermore, you have to make sure that your images are as responsive as your layout is. There is a great tool that I have been using lately, which can help you generate all the different versions of the images that you might need and also generate the HTML5 code that can utilise them. It\u2019s called Responsive Image Breakpoints Generator. I usually prefer generating 8\u201310 different images.\nOf course you can use the generated HTML5 code in any frontend app or website. In addition, if you are into gulp, you could automate this process with the gulp-responsive plugin.\nLazy loading basically means that we defer the loading of images that are not required immediately. Typically, any image that is not visible to the users on their current viewport, can be loaded at a later point in time, when the image enters or is about to enter the viewport.\nNo matter which framework you are using, you can find a plugin that can lazy-load the images for you (e.g. v-lazy-image in VueJS), however you could build your own implementation too. Just make sure that you are utilising the modern way to detect when an element enters or exits the browser\u2019s viewport, the IntersesectionObserver API.\nIf you have already optimised the size and the number of images that your website loads, and especially if it\u2019s going to be available globally, you could also use a content delivery network (CDN) to serve them.\nIn a few words, a CDN caches your images on its globally distributed network of servers. So if a user from Australia requests an image from your website, instead of retrieving that image from your server in Europe, the CDN is going to deliver it from another one, closer to that user in Australia. This cuts down the round trip time needed to load the image.\nAll modern frameworks optimise your code during the production build time (code-splitting, tree-shaking, minification, etc.). What you can do on top of that?\nHTML is the backbone of nearly every web app. When it comes to referencing resources within your HTML document there are a few best practices you should follow. It is recommended to:\nAngular, React, and VueJS all provide you with lazy-loading features. You only have to split your code properly, according to your own needs and load only the modules that you need, as soon as you really need them. For instance, if you have an e-commerce app, you have to make sure that the Basket module or the Payments module are not loaded when the user is in the home page.\nIn general, for all the assets that are essential to your frontend (images & code) you should apply compression and cache them properly.\nFile compression will make your app\u2019s assets a bit lighter and decrease the round trip time needed to serve them. One of the most commonly used file compression methods is Gzip, an excellent method for shrinking code chunks, documents, images and audio files.\nBrotli is another file compression algorithm, and it\u2019s growing in popularity. This open source algorithm is regularly updated by software engineers from Google and other organisations. It has proven itself to compress files at a much better ratio than other existing methods.\nYou can enable your preferred compression method on nginx, apache or whichever server you are using, by modifying their configuration files (enabling brotli on nginx or enabling brotli on apache).\nWhen it comes to caching, the most commonly used caching technique (also recommended by Lighthouse) is called Leverage Browser Caching. Again, you can enable it by modifying your server\u2019s configuration files (enabling Leverage Browser Caching).\nWhen it comes to websites and frontend applications, performance is a huge topic and we should take it seriously.\nI hope this article helped you understand and enabled you to tackle some of the most important things that we need to take care of when we want to improve an application\u2019s performance.\nFor a detailed checklist, make sure that you check out the Front-End-Performance-Checklist.\nCheers! \ud83d\ude80\n", "claps": "835 claps", "author": "Dimitris Kiriakakis", "comments": [], "link": "https://medium.freecodecamp.org/how-to-boost-your-front-end-applications-performance-72ce872b08c"}, {"title": "All you need to know about Promise.all \u2013 freeCodeCamp.org", "num_comments": 3, "tags": ["web development", "technology", "software development", "javascript", "nodejs"], "reading_time": 3, "text": "Promises in JavaScript are one of the powerful APIs that help us to do Async operations.\nPromise.all takes Async operations to the next new level as it helps you to aggregate a group of promises.\nIn other words, I can say that it helps you to do concurrent operations (sometimes for free).\nYou have to know what is a Promise in JavaScript.\nPromise.all is actually a promise that takes an array of promises as an input (an iterable). Then it gets resolved when all the promises get resolved or any one of them gets rejected.\nFor example, assume that you have ten promises (Async operation to perform a network call or a database connection). You have to know when all the promises get resolved or you have to wait till all the promises resolve. So you are passing all ten promises to Promise.all. Then, Promise.all itself as a promise will get resolved once all the ten promises get resolved or any of the ten promises get rejected with an error.\nLet\u2019s see it in code:\nAs you can see, we are passing an array to Promise.all. And when all three promises get resolved, Promise.all resolves and the output is consoled.\nLet\u2019s see an example:\nIn the above example, Promise.all resolves after 2000 ms and the output is consoled as an array.\nOne interesting thing about Promise.all is that the order of the promises is maintained. The first promise in the array will get resolved to the first element of the output array, the second promise will be a second element in the output array and so on.\nLet\u2019s see another example:\nFrom the above example, it\u2019s clear that Promise.all waits till all the promises resolve.\nLet\u2019s see what happens if any one of the promises are rejected.\nAs you can see, if one of the promises fails, then all the rest of the promises fail. Then Promise.all gets rejected.\nFor some use cases, you don\u2019t need that. You need to execute all the promises even if some have failed, or maybe you can handle the failed promises later.\nLet\u2019s see how to handle that.\nAssume that you have to perform a huge number of Async operations like sending bulk marketing emails to thousands of users.\nSimple pseudo code would be:\nThe above example is straightforward. But it\u2019s not very performant. The stack will become too heavy and at one point of time, JavaScript will have a huge number of open HTTP connection which may kill the server.\nA simple performant approach would be to do it in batches. Take first 500 users, trigger the mail and wait till all the HTTP connections are closed. And then take the next batch to process it and so on.\nLet\u2019s see an example:\nLet\u2019s consider another scenario: You have to build an API that gets information from multiple third-party APIs and aggregates all the responses from the APIs.\nPromise.all is the perfect way of doing that. Let\u2019s see how.\nTo conclude, Promise.all is the best way to aggregate a group of promises to a single promise. This is one of the ways of achieving concurrency in JavaScript.\nHope you liked this article.

This is a framework/library way of thinking. It\u2019s like asking, I want a cool html library. All web components are interoperable by definition to play well with others.\nCustom components and widgets that build on the Web Component standards, will work across modern browsers, and can be used with any JavaScript library or framework that works with HTML.\nThis is also why tools like Bit (GitHub) are a powerful combination with Web components, as you can easily organize a collection of reusable components your team can share, develop and use across projects and applications.\nWith all the chatter around web components, Stencil, Svelte, Lit HTML etc, I decided to take a look at what web component libraries are available around the web today to get a head start on the future. Feel free to suggest more!\nUsually, the title \u201cMaterial\u201d positions a UI component library right at the top of the star-count and downloads count. Google\u2019s Material-components-web library is the web-component version of the Material-UI library. While still a work in progress, these Web Components can be incorporated into a wide range of contexts and frameworks. Definitely keep track of this one.\nGoogle\u2019s Polymer library lets you build encapsulated, reusable Web Components that work like standard HTML elements with an experience as simple as importing and using any other HTML element. Polymer elements is a GitHub organization containing over 100 reusable Polymer components as standalone repositories you can browse and use off-the-shelf. Example:\nI think this one is promising. It\u2019s a rather new library containing a set of nearly 30 evolving open source web components for building the UI of mobile and desktop web applications across modern browsers. Development is active and I\u2019ll definitely keep track of this library. Check it out.\nWired elements is a 7K stars collection of elements that appear hand drawn. Built for wireframes, the elements are drawn so that no two renderings will be exactly the same \u2014 just like two separate hand-drawn shapes. Useful? maybe. Awesome? definitely :) Play with them online here, even with React and Vue.\nElix is a community-driven reusable set of customizable web components for common user interface patterns. To ensure high-quality standards the components are measured against the Gold Standard checklist for web components, which uses the built-in HTML elements as the quality bar. I\u2019m really excited about this one, and they\u2019re looking for contributors... :)\nThis rather old 1.5K stars library is basically a component that provides custom subtypes of the standard HTML <time> element. By formatting a timestamp as a localized string or as relative text that auto-updates in the user\u2019s browser, you can create custom extensions to use anywhere. Nice.\nBuilt by SAP\u2019s UI5, this library is a set of lightweight, reusable and independent UI elements. The components are not however built on top of UI5, but are standalone elements. You can use across frameworks and apps. The design of the components is aligned to the SAP Fiori Design Guidelines and incorporates the Fiori 3 design. Check out the live playground and APIs.\nRun demo:\nPatternFly Elements is a collection of nearly 20 flexible and lightweight Web Components, and the tools to build them. PatternFly Elements are lightweight in size and boilerplating (which is pretty much the web component standard), work in React, Vue, Angular, vanilla JS, anywhere HTML elements are used.\nThis isn\u2019t a library, but rather Google\u2019s web component discovery portal built around Polymer elements and friends. I\u2019m listing it here since it\u2019s a useful way to update on new web components from the Polymer team and provides some useful resources to read when starting with web components.\n", "claps": "1.92K claps", "author": "Jonathan Saring", "comments": ["Very fun!

I never found someone who had the same background as I did, and most likely mine won\u2019t match yours exactly.\nNonetheless, I hope that my story inspires others and acts as a valuable data point that can be added to your success story dataset.\nI took a Visual Basic for Applications (VBA) course in high school (nine years ago). In my freshman engineering course (seven years ago), I learned some C, Python, Matlab, and Labview. I graduated from a good university with a chemical engineering degree and a good GPA (three years ago). I hadn\u2019t done any programming outside of school, in high school or college, until I decided I wanted to learn last year.\nAfter college, I got a job as a Process Engineer at a refinery. I worked there until I changed careers into Software Engineering.\nI enjoyed solving technical problems, but I knew I wanted to get into the business/startup world at some point. I always kept the thought of an MBA in the back of my mind, but every time I looked at the price tag of the top schools, my interest waned.\nOn May 27th, 2017 I found myself googling about MBAs again, and somehow I stumbled upon software engineering. It seemed like a perfect fit.\nSoftware engineers are in increasing demand, salaries are great, and it\u2019s the perfect industry from which to get into the startup world without needing a ton of initial capital. All you need is a computer, and your opportunities are limitless (kind of).\nIn no other engineering discipline can you just have an idea, start building it, show it to users, and iterate with little capital and low barrier to entry. In chemical engineering, you essentially need a running plant or a lot of money to design a plant if you had an idea for a new product.\nI had heard of people quitting their jobs and attending a bootcamp, but the more I read about it online, the more I realized that you can totally learn it all on your own if you are committed and focused.\nYou might argue that you are losing out on the networking and career advice provided by a bootcamp. This can be true, but I was fortunate in that I was living in the Bay Area which allowed me to attend several meetups, so I networked that way.\nBesides, the worst case was that I\u2019d realize that I couldn\u2019t do it on my own, and then I would quit my job to attend a bootcamp.\nYou need to have a goal. Especially if you are trying to learn while working full-time. It is easy to let your learning drag on and on if you don\u2019t have any external pressure pushing you. So you need to create internal pressure. Your goal should be simple and quantitative. You should do enough research to come up with a reasonable goal. Mine was the following:\nGet a software engineering job within one year with the same or better salary than I am making right now.\nOnce you have a goal, you need a plan to help you get there. This is where you consume as many success stories as you can. None of them will match your exact situation, but you can take some advice from each one. I developed (and iterated on) my plan using resources such as the learnprogramming subreddit, the freeCodeCamp forum, and Medium.\nOn May 27, 2017 I decided I was going to make the coding plunge, and I dove in head first. That day I decided to start putting in no more than 40 hours per week at my job, so that I had time to code after work and on the weekends. Luckily for you, I did a pretty good job of documenting my progress.\nMy plan, through many iterations, ended up looking something like this:\nTo start, my plan was simple. At the time, I thought I was going to follow Google\u2019s Technical Guide, so I started with their recommended introductory course, Udacity CS101.\nThe high of making this big decision gave me a ton of energy. I would start coding as soon as I got home from work and wouldn\u2019t stop until I went to bed. And then again all weekend. Udacity CS101 tracked completion percentage, which was a big motivator for me. I logged my completion percentage every day after coding. I finished the first 75% in 10 days. The last 25% was heavy in recursion, and it was a bit tougher for me. All in all, it took me 20 days to finish Udacity CS101.\nWhile I was taking Udacity CS101, I had started reading the learnprogramming subreddit quite heavily. I read that it was important for self-taught developers looking to make a career change to be active online. I decided to make new Twitter, Reddit, Stack Overflow, Medium, and Quora accounts using my full name, so that I could build up an online presence.\nAlso, I decided to stop reading distracting media like Instagram, Facebook, and non-programming subreddits. I would only check my phone for programming-related news and posts. This was crucial in making sure that I was finding out about the best learning paths and learning resources. It was because of this that I found out about Harvard CS50 on edX.\nI was originally content with just doing one intro course, but everyone seemed to recommend Harvard CS50, so I decided to dive into that next. CS students at other schools had taken this course and said they learned more in CS50 than a year or two at their university studying CS. The general consensus was that the course was difficult but worth it. By the end of Month 0, I had completed the first 5 lectures and homework assignments.\nI completed CS50 about halfway into the month. I\u2019m not going to comment too much on my experience with CS50, because I wrote an in-depth post about my experience here.\nTLDR: It\u2019s a great course, I highly recommend it. David Malan is an excellent lecturer, and there are a ton of resources to help you get through it. You start in C, move on to Python, and then finish with web development. It is very dense, and there is a lot of material, but I think it is well worth it.\nAfter CS50, I decided to set up my XPS 15 to dual boot Windows and Ubuntu. That was a frustrating weekend. I messed up my partitions and almost bricked my laptop. I was close to chucking my laptop and getting a new one.\nI slowly weaned myself off of Windows and eventually was solely using Ubuntu. I wanted to force myself to get comfortable with the command line which I think worked to some degree, but I still have a long ways to go.\nI started 100 days of code to make sure I stayed focused and coded every day. It is important to document your progress. If you are making progress every day, it won\u2019t seem like much but when you look back a month or several months, you will realize that you have actually made quite a bit of progress which motivates you to keep going.\nI knew that networking would make or break me, so I mustered up the courage to go to my first coding meetup. I had never gone to any meetup let alone a coding meetup. I was so nervous that after driving there, parking, and walking to the door, I almost turned around and went home.\nIt helped that it was the first meetup for the group. I quickly realized that there was no reason to be nervous. No one knew each other, no one was judgmental, and everyone was eager to learn. This was the beginning of a meetup-spree. I ended up attending over 50 meetups in 9 months.\nI\u2019m glad that I started going to meetups early. Most people only started to attend meetups when they were looking for a job, but at that point it is almost too late. There are so many reasons to start early. To name a few:\nThere was some uncertainty at this time in my coding journey. This was about when I needed to decide what kind of software developer I wanted to be.\nUltimately, I chose web development because it seemed like there was high demand and also a lot of online resources. Once I had that figured out, I needed to figure out what to do next. Some people recommended that at this stage I should think about web apps I wanted to build and then get going. Some people recommended The Odin Project or freeCodeCamp.\nThe guy that was running the weekly meetup I was attending knew Ruby and wanted to do projects with Ruby. This was a big reason why I made the decision to go all in on The Odin Project.\nAnd then two days later I ditched that idea.\nThat is one of the downsides of going the self-taught route. One minute you think you know what path you should take, but then the next day you wonder if that was the right move.\nI read that Ruby was falling out of favor, and I proved this by searching for Ruby vs JavaScript jobs, so I ended up starting freeCodeCamp. The one thing that bothered me about freeCodeCamp was that they came up with the project ideas, so every camper does the same projects. This concerned me at first because I wanted to stand out to recruiters. However, I ended up loving freeCodeCamp, and now I highly recommend it. For more details on my experience and recommendations regarding freeCodeCamp, check out my writeup here.\nI started reading You Don\u2019t Know JavaScript, because everyone recommended it to supplement freeCodeCamp. I had to re-read several sections as it is pretty dense, but it\u2019s a perfect resource to learn lexical scope, closures, promises, and all parts of JavaScript that you hear about and want to learn but never do because they seem difficult.\nI finished the front-end section of freeCodeCamp. The checklist format and estimated completion time helped motivate me to finish quickly. I was also itching to move on to the next section and learn React. However, this also meant that my projects had minimal styling. I did whatever it took to fulfill the user stories and nothing more.\nIn hindsight, maybe I should have focused on making the projects more appealing. Perhaps, this would have helped me learn CSS more deeply.\nThe next step was learning React, and I was pretty pumped.\nI had heard so much about it, and I was ready to fit in with the cool kids. However, I was a little hesitant given the licensing issues at the time. I\u2019m really glad that is no longer an issue. Learning React was difficult for me. I wasn\u2019t aware of any good tutorials then (but it seems like there are a ton now).\nI tried reading the docs and following along with Facebook\u2019s Tic-Tac-Toe tutorial, but I didn\u2019t quite understand all of it. I was told if that wasn\u2019t working for me, then it meant I didn\u2019t understand JavaScript enough. So then I went back to reading You Don\u2019t Know JavaScript, but again that was too dense for me.\nUltimately, I just decided I would work my way through the freeCodeCamp React projects to see how it went. That code was ugly, but it did help me understand React a little better.\nThat meetup I had been attending weekly decided that they were going to build projects with full stack JavaScript instead of Ruby, and they decided that the first project would be to build a website for the meetup group, CodeClub.Social.\nI developed cards using React and Meetup API allowing the user to sign up for the next three meetups from our website. It was a little difficult for me to take a quick break from freeCodeCamp to do this, but it was an opportunity I couldn\u2019t pass up. I was happy to be working on a project with a small group of people. It also helped me learn Git and Github.\nBefore the month was over, I started working on the back end section of freeCodeCamp.\nI worked through all of the API projects in freeCodeCamp, but I started deviating from freeCodeCamp at the Image Search Abstraction Layer project.\nI was itching to make full stack web applications, so as soon as I saw the title of this project, I had an idea for my own project. I would make a node app that would store random imgur URLs in a database, and then make a front end that would output a user-specified number of those random images. What everyone says is true: you work harder and have more success when you are working on a project that was your own idea.\nOnce I got it to work, I was very proud of myself. It was ugly and clunky, but it worked.\nAs I was working through freeCodeCamp, I was learning about what projects would be within my capabilities. I was running regularly at the time, so I would come up with ideas on my runs and write them down when I got home. That way I would have a list of project ideas when I was ready.\nI finally felt ready to start making my own useful and polished full-stack web apps to share with users and put on my portfolio. I was so ready to get started.\nWhen looking for a new restaurant, I always found myself opening Yelp to check reviews, and then opening Maps to check their reviews. What if I made an app that compared both side by side?\nSo I made Yeggle. I used Node/Express/React along with the Google Maps and Yelp APIs. There were a couple obstacles I didn\u2019t think I would be able to overcome, but in the end I finished and I was very proud of my app. Then I posted it to Reddit, and no one cared. That was a bit of a bummer, but I didn\u2019t let it get me down.\nI didn\u2019t get quite as much done this month, as I started it off with a two week vacation to Japan and Thailand!\nBut I did start and complete my next project. I kept reading about how difficult it was to get a job as a self-taught developer, so I thought I needed to do something unique. I remembered a game where a Dow Jones stock graph started trending, and you had one opportunity to buy and one opportunity to sell, and the goal was to beat the market. The purpose of the game was to show you how difficult it was to beat the market.\nMy idea was to make a game similar to that, but instead of the market, you would be playing against a machine learning algorithm. So I created StockIT.\nI took a video tutorial on Pandas and Scikit Learn that covered multiple machine learning techniques. I originally wanted to do some cool deep learning techniques, but I realized that took massive datasets and more time than I wanted to spend.\nInstead, I stuck to a simple linear regression model. I thought that would be the hard part, but it wasn\u2019t. Getting D3 to jive with React was the hard part. Both libraries wanted to control the DOM. There were some other libraries that helped to join the two, but I felt they were too bloated. I ended up using D3 to generate the SVGs and React to handle the DOM which worked out quite well for me.\nThis time when I shared it with Reddit, everyone loved it!\nTurns out, just like VCs, redditors are all about that machine learning. All the love from Reddit was a big confidence boost. People were playing my game and enjoying it!\nAfter StockIT, I rolled right into my next personal project. I wanted to make a job board that aggregated the smaller tech-focused job listing websites such as Stack Overflow, Github, and Hacker News. To add my own unique spin to it, I decided to have it sort based on the technologies the user wanted in a job and how badly they wanted each of them.\nFor example, let\u2019s say I was looking for a job that was looking for someone who knew JavaScript, React, and/or Python, and I really wanted to work with JavaScript and React but I didn\u2019t care so much about Python. Then I could give JavaScript a 3, React a 3, and maybe Python a 1. The listings would then sort accordingly.\nI ran into various obstacles with this project and had to change course a couple times, but I ended up with a product I was happy with. My final tech stack was React/Node/Express/MySQL. I posted the project to the cscareerquestions subreddit and got 650 views before it was taken down because they don\u2019t allow personal projects.\nThe \u201cfinal\u201d product is here, and if you\u2019re interested in knowing more about my struggles and refactors, check out my post here.\nBecause of my issues, jobSort() took up a decent portion of the month. I ended up getting coffee with a friend I had met at my first meetup, and he advised me to start applying for jobs now. I read all over the place that everyone says they waited too long to apply. Also, whenever I saw a post asking when to apply, the top comment was always \u201cnow.\u201d\nIn my head, I was going to work my way through my structured plan to build up my portfolio with personal projects, and then work on open source contributions, and then prepare for interviews, and finally start applying to jobs. This friend convinced me to ditch that plan and start applying. So this month I made a portfolio and a resume. The following month I would start applying.\nThis month I focused on touching up my projects and applying to jobs. I also wanted to learn testing and Redux.\nI added flexbox to CodeClub.Social to make it responsive. I improved the mobile UX on jobSort(). I added testing to jobSort() with mocha/chai/enzyme which was difficult to set up, easy to get started, and then difficult to get 100% coverage.\nBy the end of the month, I had applied to 63 jobs. I viewed this as a self-assessment. Was my portfolio/resume good enough? If so, what did I need to work on to prepare for interviews? At first, I applied with Hacker News: Who is Hiring, and Indeed.\nOn Hacker News, I used jobSort() to determine which listings to apply for. On Indeed, I tried non-software companies to see if I could even get a call or an interview anywhere.\nAt first, I was applying quickly and not personalizing my resume/cover letter. Then, I decided to personalize my cover letter and resume, and then try to send an email to someone from the company. This method was clearly better than the shotgun approach.\nI received five calls that month \u2014 two from recruiting companies and three from software companies that included:\nI made it past the HR screen in two of these, but none of them yielded an onsite interview. I was pretty happy with the three calls, and I learned a lot from them.\nEveryone mentioned online that junior developers aren\u2019t expected to know that much from the start, they just need to be passionate and excited to learn. So I thought, easy. I am passionate and excited to learn. What I learned from these calls, however, was that nobody was looking for a junior developer. They expect you to know what you\u2019re doing from day one.\nThese calls taught me that I needed to\nI started this month working the night shift for a 40 day stretch at my full time job - 6 days a week, 12 hours a day, 5PM to 5AM. Ugh.\nI knew I wouldn\u2019t be able to get as much done this month, but I had a goal and I wanted to meet it, so I couldn\u2019t take a month off.\nI refactored jobSort.tech to use Redux which was surprisingly not as difficult as I thought it would be. I listened to a lot of podcasts about it and read blogposts about it, and it never quite made sense to me until I started using it.\nI really like the flow of data with Redux. It\u2019s interesting now seeing people complain about Redux. I don\u2019t think I\u2019m qualified to spout off my opinions strongly, but I do like the reducer pattern.\nThis was supposed to be the month of open source for me. I was going to make my first open source contribution, and it would be a great contribution to a fantastic library. I was going to contribute to React!\nEveryone said it was a difficult codebase to read let alone contribute to. But I needed to stand out, I needed to be unique. I knew that my contribution wouldn\u2019t be significant, but I still wanted to do it nonetheless.\nI would start by reading the docs all the way through and then pouring through the codebase. Watch every issue, every PR. Reading through the React docs in full was a great exercise, and I\u2019m glad I did it. But I quickly realized that the issue with contributing to React is that there just aren\u2019t that many \u201cgood first issues,\u201d and they get snatched up quickly.\nAt one of the meetups I attended, Anthony Ng recommended that I try out Downshift, an autocomplete library by Kent C. Dodds. This was a gamechanger. It was right in my wheelhouse. The right difficulty, right amount of issues to help with, not too many collaborators, super helpful maintainer, clean well-tested code. On top of all that, it was a perfect solution to some issues I was having with my jobSort() application.\nAbout halfway through the month, I received an email from one of the companies I applied to in the previous month. They set up an initial phone screen, and then a technical phone screen. The technologies they were looking for were exactly what I had learned - React, Redux, and D3. I mostly just talked about my projects and why I made certain decisions. After this, they asked me to come onsite for an interview. My first onsite interview!\nI hadn\u2019t prepared for interviews at all, so I went into it with the expectation that I wouldn\u2019t get the job, but I would gain valuable interviewing experience. I also was running on three hours of sleep since I was still working the night shift which didn\u2019t help. Luckily, the technical portion wasn\u2019t whiteboarding, just a one-hour pair programming session. It was a fairly straightforward challenge, but I was very nervous.\nAt first, I was worried about making sure I knew everything without looking it up. When I realized that I wasn\u2019t going to finish the challenge, I realized that I needed to stop worrying what the interviewer thought of me and just google/stack overflow to find answers. I didn\u2019t end up finishing, and I thought I failed miserably.\nSince I thought I failed the pair programming, I felt relaxed for the rest of the interview. Ultimately, I left the interview with my chin up. Worst case I got some valuable interviewing experience, and best case I got my first job offer.\nI ended up receiving my first job offer 9 months and 7 days after that first day when I decided I was going to dive head first into programming with the intent of changing careers. I felt confident given that I received an offer after my first onsite interview, but at the same time, if I didn\u2019t take the offer, what if this was the only offer I would receive for several months? I ended up taking the offer, and I am happy with my decision. I wanted to get paid to code!\nUp to this point, I have mostly shared my story with some advice sprinkled in. Chances are if you\u2019re reading this, you either are thinking about changing careers or are in the middle of learning to code with the intent of changing careers. I hope that the advice below will help you develop a plan or stick with your current plan and reach your goal.\nNow get back out there and code!\n", "claps": "102K claps", "author": "Austin Tackaberry", "comments": ["For other readers, a few caveats worth bearing in mind.

But this is one of them:\nDeciding on your first programming language can be a fun process \u2014 kind of like one of those \u201cWhich Quentin Tarantino character are you?\u201d personality quizzes.\nBut before you run off to learn Ruby because you enjoyed playing with Play-Doh as a kid, let me remind you: the stakes are pretty high here.\nIt will take you hundreds of hours of practice to become even remotely competent with your first programming language.\nSo you should consider the following factors:\nEvery year brings new programming languages, and with them, new academic papers. And new web comics.\nSeriously. Check out this gem from last month:\nWhen it comes to choosing a first programming language, there\u2019s no shortage of options. To narrow it down a bit, here are the most common Google searches related to learning programming, over the past 12 years:\nJava has had its ups and downs.\nPython has gradually risen to become the most popular choice.\nBut tucked away below these is the Little Engine That Could, slowly choo-choo\u2019ing up in popularity over the past few years. And that engine is JavaScript.\nBefore I talk about these programming languages, let me clarify:\nLet\u2019s kick things off by exploring how programming is currently taught in school.\nUniversities have traditionally taught programming under the umbrella of computer science, which itself is often seen as an extension of mathematics, or tie-in to an electrical engineering degree.\nOf course, as you may have heard by now:\nAs of 2016, many universities still treat programming like it\u2019s computer science, and computer science like it\u2019s math.\nAs a result, many introductory programming courses focus on low-level-of-abstraction languages like C, or mathematically-focused languages like MATLAB.\nAnd department chairs generally stay the course, pointing to annual programming language leaderboards like the TIOBE Index, or this one from the IEEE:\nMost of these leaderboards look virtually identical to how they were 10 years ago.\nBut change does happen. Even in academia.\nIn 2014, Python overtook Java as a the most popular language of instruction at top US Computer Science programs.\nAnd yet another change is bound to... eventually... happen.\nBecause if you look at the languages actually used by the workforce, it paints a very different picture:\nMore than half of all developers use JavaScript. It\u2019s vital to front-end web development and increasingly relevant for back-end development. And it\u2019s rapidly expanding into areas like game development and the Internet of Things.\nJob postings also mention JavaScript more than any programming language other than Java:\nIt\u2019s no accident that we built our open source community\u2019s curriculum around JavaScript. Over the past two years, more than 5,000 people have used Free Code Camp to get their first developer job.\nI\u2019m not advocating JavaScript because I teach it. I teach JavaScript because it\u2019s the surest path to a first developer job.\nBut is JavaScript right for you? Is it worthy of being your first programming language? Let\u2019s explore those factors I mentioned earlier.\nIf you\u2019re learning to program purely out of intellectual curiosity, feel free to skip this factor. But if you \u2014 like the vast majority of people learning to program \u2014 want to use this skill to get a job, this is an important consideration.\nAs I mentioned earlier, Java is mentioned in more job postings than any other programming language. JavaScript is a close second.\nBut here\u2019s the thing about JavaScript: even though it\u2019s been around for 20 years, it only recently became a serious tool that companies like Netflix, Walmart, and PayPal would build entire applications around.\nAs a result, plenty of companies are hiring JavaScript developers, but there just aren\u2019t that many on the job market.\nThere are 2.7 Java developers competing for every open Java position. Competition for PHP and iOS jobs is similarly fierce.\nBut for every open JavaScript position, there are only 0.6 JavaScript developers. It is very much a sellers\u2019 market for developers with JavaScript skills.\nThe average JavaScript project receives twice as many pull requests as the average Java, Python, or Ruby project. And on top of this, JavaScript is growing faster than any other popular language.\nJavaScript\u2019s ecosystem also benefits from a heavy investment of money and engineering talent from companies like Google, Microsoft, Facebook, and Netflix.\nFor example, TypeScript (a statically-typed superset of JavaScript) has more than 100 open source contributors, many of whom are Microsoft and Google employees being paid to work on it.\nThis type of inter-company cooperation is harder to find with Java. Oracle \u2014 who effectively owns Java through its acquisition of Sun Microsystems \u2014 often sues companies who try to expand upon it.\nMost programmers would agree that high-level scripting languages are relatively easy to learn. JavaScript falls into this category, along with Python and Ruby.\nEven though universities still teach languages like Java and C++ as first languages, they\u2019re considerably harder to learn.\nThis is where JavaScript really shines. JavaScript runs on any device that has a browser, right there in the browser. You can build basically anything with JavaScript, and share it anywhere.\nBecause of JavaScript\u2019s ubiquity, Stack Overflow co-founder Jeff Atwood coined his now-famous law:\nAnd with each passing month, Atwood\u2019s Law holds strong.\nJava once promised to run everywhere, too. You may remember Java Applets. Oracle officially killed them off earlier this year.\nPython suffers from much the same problems:\nBy contrast, here are some apps that members of our open source community built in their browsers on CodePen. You can click through and use these right in your browser:\nIf you keep jumping from language to language, you won\u2019t get far.\nIn order to move beyond the basics, you need to learn your first language well. Then your second language will be much, much easier.\nFrom there, you can branch out, and become a more well-rounded developer by learning lots of languages:\nBut learn JavaScript first.\nOK, now I\u2019m going to attempt the impossible \u2014 I\u2019m going to try and anticipate objections from the comments section.\nJavaScript is \u2014 for most practical purposes \u2014 as fast as high-performance languages.\nJavaScript (Node.js) is orders of magnitude faster than Python, Ruby, and PHP.\nIt is also nearly as fast as high-performance languages like C++, Java, and Go.\nHere are the results of the most comprehensive recent cross-language benchmark:\nLike Python and Ruby, JavaScript is dynamically typed, which is convenient. But you can get into trouble. Here I intend for exampleArray to be an array. I set its values, then check its length \u2014 meaning the number of elements it contains.\nBut then I accidentally assign it to be a string.\nThese kinds of errors happen all the time in dynamically typed languages. Most developers just put checks in place to prevent them, and write tests accordingly.\nIf you absolutely must have static typing in your first programming language, then I still recommend you learn JavaScript first. Then you can quickly pick up TypeScript.\nI still recommend learning JavaScript first.\nAlso, it\u2019s worth pointing out that the mobile app development\u2019s best days may very well be behind it.\nFor starters, as much as people use mobile apps, nearly half of all developer jobs are web development. Compare this with a mere 8% of jobs that involve mobile app development.\nThe grand vision of \u201cthere\u2019s an app for that\u201d has not come to pass. Instead, most smartphone owners have stopped downloading new apps.\nSure \u2014 they still use apps. Mostly Facebook, Google Maps, and handful of others. As such, much of the demand for mobile app developers is concentrated in a few large employers.\nThe outlook for those mobile development jobs is hard to forecast. Many aspects of developing, maintaining, and distributing mobile apps are easier with JavaScript. So companies like Facebook and Google are investing heavily in better tools for building these using JavaScript.\nAs of 2016, pretty much all development is web development. Everything touches that big platform that is \u201cthe web.\u201d And the next wave of devices that you\u2019ll talk to around your home, and cars that pick your kids up from school \u2014 they\u2019ll all be piped together using the web, too.\nAnd that means JavaScript.\nJavaScript has a quirky history.\nYou will undoubtedly hear people crack jokes at its expense.\nWell people love to hate on C++, too. And like JavaScript, C++ has succeeded despite this hate, and now it\u2019s pretty much everywhere as well.\nSo if anybody ever gives you a hard time for learning JavaScript instead of elite-language-of-the-week, just remember the famous words of the guy who created C++:\nI only write about programming and technology. If you follow me on Twitter I won\u2019t waste your time. \ud83d\udc4d\n", "claps": "18.8K claps", "author": "Quincy Larson", "comments": ["Always enjoy your writing Quincy.

And how do you do it??\nEssentially, it\u2019s all about a more effective way for problem solving.\nIn this post, my goal is to teach you that way.\nBy the end of it, you\u2019ll know exactly what steps to take to be a better problem-solver.\nProblem solving is the meta-skill.\nWe all have problems. Big and small. How we deal with them is sometimes, well...pretty random.\nUnless you have a system, this is probably how you \u201csolve\u201d problems (which is what I did when I started coding):\nLook, sometimes you luck out. But that is the worst way to solve problems! And it\u2019s a huge, huge waste of time.\nThe best way involves a) having a framework and b) practicing it.\nTo find the right framework, I followed the advice in Tim Ferriss\u2019 book on learning, \u201cThe 4-Hour Chef\u201d.\nIt led me to interview two really impressive people: C. Jordan Ball (ranked 1st or 2nd out of 65,000+ users on Coderbyte), and V. Anton Spraul (author of the book \u201cThink Like a Programmer: An Introduction to Creative Problem Solving\u201d).\nI asked them the same questions, and guess what? Their answers were pretty similar!\nSoon, you too will know them.\nSidenote: this doesn\u2019t mean they did everything the same way. Everyone is different. You\u2019ll be different. But if you start with principles we all agree are good, you\u2019ll get a lot further a lot quicker.\nSo, what should you do when you encounter a new problem?\nHere are the steps:\nKnow exactly what is being asked. Most hard problems are hard because you don\u2019t understand them (hence why this is the first step).\nHow to know when you understand a problem? When you can explain it in plain English.\nDo you remember being stuck on a problem, you start explaining it, and you instantly see holes in the logic you didn\u2019t see before?\nMost programmers know this feeling.\nThis is why you should write down your problem, doodle a diagram, or tell someone else about it (or thing... some people use a rubber duck).\nDon\u2019t dive right into solving without a plan (and somehow hope you can muddle your way through). Plan your solution!\nNothing can help you if you can\u2019t write down the exact steps.\nIn programming, this means don\u2019t start hacking straight away. Give your brain time to analyze the problem and process the information.\nTo get a good plan, answer this question:\n\u201cGiven input X, what are the steps necessary to return output Y?\u201d\nSidenote: Programmers have a great tool to help them with this... Comments!\nPay attention. This is the most important step of all.\nDo not try to solve one big problem. You will cry.\nInstead, break it into sub-problems. These sub-problems are much easier to solve.\nThen, solve each sub-problem one by one. Begin with the simplest. Simplest means you know the answer (or are closer to that answer).\nAfter that, simplest means this sub-problem being solved doesn\u2019t depend on others being solved.\nOnce you solved every sub-problem, connect the dots.\nConnecting all your \u201csub-solutions\u201d will give you the solution to the original problem. Congratulations!\nThis technique is a cornerstone of problem-solving. Remember it (read this step again, if you must).\nBy now, you\u2019re probably sitting there thinking \u201cHey Richard... That\u2019s cool and all, but what if I\u2019m stuck and can\u2019t even solve a sub-problem??\u201d\nFirst off, take a deep breath. Second, that\u2019s fair.\nDon\u2019t worry though, friend. This happens to everyone!\nThe difference is the best programmers/problem-solvers are more curious about bugs/errors than irritated.\nIn fact, here are three things to try when facing a whammy:\nSidenote: Another way of reassessing is starting anew. Delete everything and begin again with fresh eyes. I\u2019m serious. You\u2019ll be dumbfounded at how effective this is.\nCaveat: Don\u2019t look for a solution to the big problem. Only look for solutions to sub-problems. Why? Because unless you struggle (even a little bit), you won\u2019t learn anything. If you don\u2019t learn anything, you wasted your time.\nDon\u2019t expect to be great after just one week. If you want to be a good problem-solver, solve a lot of problems!\nPractice. Practice. Practice. It\u2019ll only be a matter of time before you recognize that \u201cthis problem could easily be solved with <insert concept here>.\u201d\nHow to practice? There are options out the wazoo!\nChess puzzles, math problems, Sudoku, Go, Monopoly, video-games, cryptokitties, bla... bla... bla....\nIn fact, a common pattern amongst successful people is their habit of practicing \u201cmicro problem-solving.\u201d For example, Peter Thiel plays chess, and Elon Musk plays video-games.\nDoes this mean you should just play video-games? Not at all.\nBut what are video-games all about? That\u2019s right, problem-solving!\nSo, what you should do is find an outlet to practice. Something that allows you to solve many micro-problems (ideally, something you enjoy).\nFor example, I enjoy coding challenges. Every day, I try to solve at least one challenge (usually on Coderbyte).\nLike I said, all problems share similar patterns.\nThat\u2019s all folks!\nNow, you know better what it means to \u201cthink like a programmer.\u201d\nYou also know that problem-solving is an incredible skill to cultivate (the meta-skill).\nAs if that wasn\u2019t enough, notice how you also know what to do to practice your problem-solving skills!\nPhew... Pretty cool right?\nFinally, I wish you encounter many problems.\nYou read that right. At least now you know how to solve them! (also, you\u2019ll learn that with every solution, you improve).\nNow, go solve some problems!\nAnd best of luck \ud83d\ude42\nSpecial thanks to C. Jordan Ball and V. Anton Spraul.

I knew the transition back would be hard, but I was not prepared for a \u201cWinter is Coming\u201d kind of difficult. A few weeks in, I found myself overwhelmed by every little thing. My mind felt like the aftermath of a fourth-grade volcano project, all thick and sticky and slow. When I was at home, I thought about work, and when I was at work, I thought about home. My inability to focus became a source of debilitating stress.\nConvinced that I had suddenly transformed into a weepier and less capable person, I asked my manager Chris if I could get an executive coach. That\u2019s how I was first introduced to Stacy McCarthy.\nThe first thing I blurted out to Stacy after we introduced ourselves was that I needed to fix everything. In increasingly high-pitched tones, I began listing off one tangled issue after another: areas that were desperately understaffed, people who wanted a change in their roles, a product strategy I didn\u2019t agree with, and so on. I imagined her helping me unravel each problem until they were simple, soft balls of yarn ready to be reknit with purpose.\nInstead, Stacy listened calmly until I was done. Then she said, \u201cWe\u2019ll get to all that later, but first, why don\u2019t we take a step back? Tell me about you.\u201d\nI could only blink. Talk about me? But how would that help any one of the seven fires that needed putting out?\nBut Stacy persisted. She asked me about my past and the road I\u2019d taken to get here. We talked about the future \u2014 the way, way future \u2014 where she asked me to picture myself at eighty, sitting on a beach and looking back on my life. What did I want to remember? Then she asked me if I would be okay with her interviewing several people who I worked closely with.\nI said yes. Two weeks later at our next meeting, she showed up with a twenty-page report all about me. There was nothing about the specific problems at hand. Instead, this stack of papers asked deeper questions about how I worked \u2014 what were my perceived strengths and weaknesses? In what ways did I impress or annoy those around me? What was my management style like?\nI remember the weight of the document as she handed it to me, tucked neatly into a manila folder. I shoved the package in my backpack, unwilling to deal with it. It was only later at night, when the baby was asleep and I was alone with the lights dimmed, that I felt ready to confront the truth. I took a deep breath and turned to the first page.\nAt that moment, feeling so ungrounded and unsure of myself, I struggled to read the report. I felt like a specimen dissected and laid bare. As much as you try to tell yourself that your inner turmoil lives inside your own head, the truth is that most of us aren\u2019t very good actors. People know. They see the faults that you don\u2019t want to admit, like how my anxiety was leading to wishy-washy decisions. But they\u2019re also kinder to you than you might imagine. I remember tearing up reading comments about how I was kicking ass in ways that I wasn\u2019t giving myself credit for.\nLooking back, that twenty-page report was one of the best things that happened to my career. It helped me calibrate my own internal compass. It allowed me to understand where my fears were overblown \u2014 nobody actually thought I was a weepy and less capable person \u2014 and where I wasn\u2019t paying enough attention \u2014 like setting clear expectations for myself and others. Once I knew where I stood, I could start moving forward.\nBeing a great manager is a highly personal journey, and if you don\u2019t have a good handle on yourself, you won\u2019t have a good handle on how to best support your team. That\u2019s what Stacy was trying to tell me. No matter what obstacles you face, you first need to get deep with knowing you \u2014 your strengths, your values, your comfort zones, your blind spots, and your biases. When you fully understand yourself, you\u2019ll know where your true north lies.\nI first learned the term imposter syndrome during my junior year of college. A professor studying gender differences stood in front of a packed lecture hall, citing example after example that gave me shivers. Yes! This describes exactly how I feel! I don\u2019t deserve to be here in this auditorium, at this dazzling institution, with so many brilliant students. I must have gotten here by error or luck or the grace of the stars. When are they going to figure out that I got good grades because I have a good memory, not because I\u2019m actually smart?\nAs a new manager, I\u2019ve felt this way countless times as well. Rebekah made a terrible mistake \u2014 I have no idea what I\u2019m doing, my inner voice would whisper every time I fumbled an interaction or struggled to make a decision.\nBut over the years, I have learned a secret that bears repeating: Every manager feels like an imposter sometimes. Every manager was once new, stumbling through interviews and 1:1s and awkward conversations. It\u2019s so common that instead of pretending like we are all ducks gliding effortlessly on the surface of the water, we should own up to the furious paddling that is happening beneath.\nImposter syndrome is what makes you feel as though you\u2019re the only one with nothing worthwhile to say when you walk into a room full of people you admire. Imposter syndrome is what makes you double-, triple-, or quadruple-check your email before hitting Send so that nobody finds any mistakes and figures out you\u2019re actually a fraud. Imposter syndrome is the sensation that you\u2019re teetering along the edge of a sheer cliff with flailing arms, the whole world watching and waiting to see when you fall.\nHere\u2019s the thing to remember: feeling this way is totally normal. Linda Hill, a professor at Harvard Business School, has spent years studying the transition into management. \u201cAsk any new manager about the early days of being a boss \u2014 indeed, ask any senior executive to recall how he or she felt as a new manager. If you get an honest answer, you\u2019ll hear a tale of disorientation and, for some, overwhelming confusion. The new role didn\u2019t feel anything like it was supposed to. It felt too big for any one person to handle.\u201d\nWhy does imposter syndrome hit managers so hard? There are two reasons. The first is that you\u2019re often looked to for answers. I\u2019ve had reports tell me about difficult personal issues and ask for my advice. I\u2019ve gotten requests for permission to do things that the company has never done before, like spend hundreds of thousands of dollars on a new initiative. I\u2019ve received emotional inquiries from people about countless decisions that I didn\u2019t make myself but that I still had to explain.\nWhen the sailing gets rocky, the manager is often the first person others turn to, so it\u2019s common to feel an intense pressure to know what to do or say. When you don\u2019t, you naturally think: Am I cut out for this job?\nThe second reason is that you are constantly put in the position of doing things you haven\u2019t done before. For example, say you have to fire someone. How do you prepare yourself for such a task? It\u2019s not like improving your skills in drawing or writing, where you can invest time on nights and weekends to sketch or compose short stories. You can\u2019t just snap your fingers and say, \u201cI\u2019m going to practice firing a lot of people this month.\u201d You must actually go through the real thing in order to gain the experience you need.\nManagement isn\u2019t an innate skill. There is no such thing as an \u201call-around great manager\u201d who can transition effortlessly between different leadership roles. We must look at the specific context.\nFor example, I consider myself a seasoned manager, but if I were to lead a team that was triple the size or in a discipline I don\u2019t know well, like sales, I\u2019d probably fail to produce strong results immediately. I\u2019d need to identify my growth areas in that environment \u2014 such as how to communicate effectively with a much larger group of people or how to set good sales goals \u2014 and spend time honing those skills.\nNo matter how often imposter syndrome rears its ugly head, it doesn\u2019t have to derail you. In these next sections, we\u2019ll look at techniques for how to deal with the inevitable doubts and discomfort that will arise.\nLet me tell you a few facts about me: I\u2019m more comfortable in small groups than big ones. I care deeply about understanding first principles. I am more articulate in writing than in person. I need time alone to reflect and process new facts before forming an opinion. I skew toward long-term thinking, which means that I sometimes make impractical short-term decisions. And at the end of the day, nothing gives me more satisfaction than learning and growing.\nWhy does any of this matter? Because these strengths and weaknesses directly affect how I manage.\nSome of my colleagues have completely different superpowers. Among the people I work closest with, one has an ability to take incredibly complex topics and transform them into easy-to-remember frameworks that get at the heart of what really matters. One\u2019s strategic prowess is so strong that I\u2019m convinced he must have been a five-star general in a past life. And one amazes me with the way she manages to keep twenty threads moving full steam ahead at the same time. Yet these same folks have told me there are things I do that they admire as well.\nThe facets of our personality are like the ingredients that come together for a recipe. Could you make a tasty dinner if you peered into your fridge and saw some broccoli, eggs, and chicken? Sure. What if you had potatoes, beef, and spinach? Of course. The key is to understand what works best with what you have.\nThe world\u2019s top leaders come from vastly different molds \u2014 some are extroverts (Winston Churchill) and some are introverts (Abraham Lincoln); some are demanding (Margaret Thatcher) and others remind you of a favorite relative (Mother Teresa); some leave a room breathless with their vision (Nelson Mandela) and others prefer to avoid the spotlight (Bill Gates).\nThe first part in understanding how you lead is to know your strengths \u2014 the things you\u2019re talented at and love to do. This is crucial because great management typically comes from playing to your strengths rather than from fixing your weaknesses. There are some useful frameworks for understanding your strengths, like StrengthsFinder 2.0 by Tom Rath or StandOut by Marcus Buckingham. If you want to do a quick version, jot down the first thing that comes to mind when you ask yourself the following questions:\nLike mine, your responses will likely cluster around a few themes. Here, you can see that my strengths are dreaming big, learning quickly, and remaining upbeat. Whatever yours are, remember them and hold them dear. You\u2019ll be relying on them time and time again.\nThe second part of getting to an honest reckoning with yourself is knowing your weaknesses and triggers. Right beneath your list of strengths, answer the following:\nAgain, you may see some themes emerging. The biggest barriers that get in my way are self-doubt, a tendency to complexify, and not being clear and direct enough.\nOkay, now that we\u2019ve got our lists, the next part is calibration, which is making sure that the view we have of ourselves matches reality. This is harder than it sounds. Our self-perception is like a roller coaster. Some days, we struggle with self-compassion. We make a mistake and our inner critic chirps loudly about how we\u2019re worthless. Other days, we think we\u2019re the best thing since sliced bread. (There\u2019s even a term to describe the cognitive bias where people who aren\u2019t actually very skilled have a tendency to think they\u2019re better than they are: the Dunning-Kruger effect.)\nCalibration matters because it doesn\u2019t do me any good to think that I\u2019m one thing when the world views me as another. For example, if I believe I\u2019m an amazing public speaker but everyone else thinks my talks are tedious, I might make a bad decision like choosing to present a bold new idea myself instead of asking someone who would sell it better. Even worse, people will start to discount what I say because they\u2019ll conclude that I have a warped sense of reality.\nTo develop our self-awareness and to calibrate our strengths and weaknesses, we must confront the truth of what we\u2019re really like by asking others for their unvarnished opinions. The goal isn\u2019t to seek praise; the goal is to give our peers a safe opening where they can be honest \u2014 even brutally honest \u2014 so that we can get the most accurate information. In the same way that you gather feedback for your reports, you can learn about yourself through the following tactics.\nAsk your manager to help you calibrate yourself through the following two questions:\nPick three to seven people whom you work closely with and ask if they\u2019d be willing to share some feedback to help you improve. Even if your company already has a process for 360-degree feedback, it helps to be specific about what you want to know and to provide reassurances that you\u2019re looking for honesty, not just pats on the back. Take the example below.\nExamples of specific asks:\nAsk for task-specific feedback to calibrate yourself on specific skills. For example, if you\u2019re not sure how good of a public speaker you are, follow up with a few people after you give a presentation and say, \u201cI\u2019m hoping to improve my speaking skills. What do you think went well with my presentation? What would have made it twice as good?\u201d\nI\u2019ll pause here and acknowledge that asking for feedback is hard. You might have read the suggestions above and cringed when thinking about doing them.\nIt took me years before I got comfortable asking for feedback from others (outside of formal reviews where I had to). Why? It goes back to the imposter syndrome. Because I constantly worried that I wasn\u2019t good enough, I shied away from doing anything that might confirm that view. I imagined someone I respected telling me that yes, indeed, I wasn\u2019t doing X or Y very well. They\u2019ve found me out! So I\u2019d keep my mouth shut and soldier on, pretending that everything was fine.\nIt takes a certain amount of confidence to ask for critical feedback. For me, the breakthrough came when I realized I needed to change my mindset. If I saw every challenge as a test of my worthiness, then I\u2019d constantly worry about where I stood rather than how I could improve. It\u2019s like stressing out more about your exam grade than about whether you\u2019re actually learning the concepts being taught.\nOn the other hand, if I approached challenges with the belief that I could get better at anything if I put in the effort, then the vicious cycle of anxious self-evaluation would be broken. No matter how good or bad I am at any particular skill, the notion that it\u2019s within my power to improve has allowed me to approach learning with curiosity instead of apprehension. And the rewards have been tremendous \u2014 I would never have known that my feedback was often vague and hand-wavy had I not invited that comment from a colleague. Once I heard it, I was able to work on making my points more precise and actionable, and now that\u2019s praised as one of my strengths.\nThis excerpt comes from the book,The Making of a Manager, by Julie Zhuo.\n", "claps": "4.2K claps", "author": "Julie Zhuo", "comments": [], "link": "https://betterhumans.coach.me/managing-yourself-how-to-calibrate-your-own-strengths-and-weaknesses-bd5a88f7121f"}, {"title": "How to Make Powerful Connections by Writing Unexpected Thank You Emails", "num_comments": "unspecified", "tags": [], "reading_time": 6, "text": "Saying thank you more often might seem like obvious advice, but the fact of the matter is, gratitude is one of the most powerful \u2014 and underutilized \u2014 ways to provide relevant, meaningful, and valuable interactions to your network.\n", "claps": "9.4K", "author": "Patrick Ewers", "comments": [], "link": "https://betterhumans.coach.me/how-to-make-powerful-connections-by-writing-unexpected-thank-you-emails-b4d8960e6ff3"}, {"title": "Is the Mueller Report a Failure? \u2013 Eudaimonia and Co", "num_comments": "unspecified", "tags": [], "reading_time": 7, "text": "Is the Mueller Report is a Failure?\nI have to confess to you that the last thing on earth I want to write about, or even think about, is the Mueller Report.

Maybe to follow a few photographers, to catch up on new memes, or to fill your feed with inspiring quotes.\nBut for the wannabe influencer, Instagram is the place to be. Everyone wants to \u201cmake it big\u201d so they can get sponsored by their favorite brands (or for some, any brand that will give them cash).\nI fell into this line of thinking \u2014 sort of.\nI\u2019ve been in the blogging world for a while (somewhere around five years). For a long time, I used Instagram for fun. But when I discovered I could use it to get more traffic to my blog, everything changed.\nI started researching things like hashtag strategies and how to create a cohesive feed. I kept my Instagram account active. But I found it to be exhausting, and eventually I stopped posting consistently. The little bit of growth I was getting wasn\u2019t worth the effort.\nSo Instagram sat in the background for a year or two.\nBut at the end of 2018/beginning of 2019, I was looking for new ways to promote my writing. I had just started a new blog that doubled as my portfolio as a freelance writer, and I was ready to share it with the world.\nPinterest was a no-brainer, but Instagram was a mystery to me.\nSo I started researching.\nAnd so I spent hours upon hours reading up on how to create the perfect Instagram account. Soon, I was signed up for the \u201cInstagram experts\u201d free email courses. I learned all about optimizing my account\u2014adding keywords to my name and bio, creating beautiful highlight covers, and using hashtags to \u201cget found.\u201d\nBut I still had so many questions.\n\u201cHow do I know which hashtags to use?\u201d\n\u201cWhy am I not growing as fast as that person?\u201d\n\u201cHow do I keep up with all of this?!\u201d\nSo I kept reading. I scoured blogs, eating up every article that promised me 10K followers and traffic to my blog. I treated every piece of advice from my favorite Insta experts like gold.\n\u201cUse all 30 hashtags,\u201d they said.\n\u201cTag brands for a chance to get featured!\u201d\n\u201cWatch your analytics and only post when your followers are most active,\u201d they added, offering you 50% off on their ebook that promises you success on Instagram.\n\u201cEngagement rates mean more than your follower count! Don\u2019t forget to interact with other users before AND after you post. The Instagram gods will bless you with better engagement if you do!\u201d\nAnd so I worked harder. And I saw results!\nFive new followers.\nBut the next day, I realized that those \u201cfollowers\u201d were gone, and I was a victim of the follow/unfollow game.\nFrustration with Instagram set in. I didn\u2019t understand what I was doing wrong. I was posting consistently, I was working on a hashtag strategy, I was interacting with others and leaving genuine comments.\nI began wishing Instagram\u2019s algorithm was different. To counter its effects, I began participating in \u201clike all\u201d threads in Facebook groups. I didn\u2019t even care about my engagement rate \u2014 I did it to rank higher in hashtags so I could \u201cget found.\u201d\nAnd it worked! I got around 50 extra followers.\nBut then my follower count stagnated. For all I know, Instagram figured out what I was doing (very likely). Maybe it was because I wasn\u2019t switching up my hashtags enough (there are only so many tags that are relevant to intentional living, which is my blogging niche). Who knows, really.\nSo I went back to those Instagram experts. I read more posts, and I participated in more free courses. Their advice?\n\u201cGetting found.\u201d\nThere are tons of accounts out there that feature photos from other people\u2019s accounts \u2014 and all you have to do is tag them!\nIt\u2019s like guest posting without effort. All you have to do is use a specific hashtag or tag an account, and you have a 0.00001% chance of getting featured.\nSounds like a great strategy, right?\n. . . Yeah, I don\u2019t know why people recommend it, either.\nBut I was hopeful and naive, so I went for it.\nGuess what? I didn\u2019t get featured. I didn\u2019t \u201cget found.\u201d\nInstead, I found myself back at the beginning, wondering how people who started blogging at the same time as me had double (or triple) the following that I did.\nI wondered, \u201cHow much work are they putting in? How many hours do they spend on Instagram just to get a few people to click the link in their bio?\u201d\nI tried hard to fight against the comparison game, and I managed for the most part. I looked at fast-growing accounts and tried to figure out what they were doing.\nBut I was spending so much time on Instagram trying to get a handful of extra followers instead of writing. Instead of living. I began to realize the true cost of using Instagram as an influencer (and the effects it has on others).\nAfter that, it was all I could see.\nAn example of this would be how much of a time-waster it can be if you don\u2019t make it big, but I\u2019m going to talk about two things that have been hitting home lately: the \u201cjust a highlight reel\u201d mentality, and the \u201canything for cash\u201d mentality.\nOver the past month, I\u2019ve seen so many bloggers/influencers temporarily step away from Instagram. When they come back, they always say the same thing:\n\u201cI needed to take a break for my mental health/self-esteem. It was time to step back and remind myself that Instagram is just a highlight reel. Nobody\u2019s life is perfect.\u201d\n. . . And then they go right back to creating a highlight reel of THEIR OWN life.\nDoesn\u2019t really add up, does it?\nInfluencers and inauthentic sponsored posts.\nIt\u2019s really sad that this is actually a problem, but it is.\nDon\u2019t understand what I mean? Here\u2019s a great example:\nTravel blogger/influencer Helene Sula recently announced something on her Instagram stories that every influencer needs to think long and hard about.\nSince Helene lives abroad, doing her taxes sucks. She had a tax company reach out to her to offer her a sponsored post. She agreed \u2014 but only if she could use the tax services first, and only if she thought it was good enough.\nThe service ended up being awful, so Helene didn\u2019t promote the company.\nThat\u2019s all well and good, but she kept going, stating that other bloggers were promoting this service.\nNow, sometimes people have bad experiences, and they may not represent the way a company normally is. But if you make a deal with someone that they\u2019ll promote your service as long as you do a good job . . . I\u2019d think you\u2019d do a good job. So that suggests that maybe the company isn\u2019t that great.\nNote: I may not be remembering this correctly, but I\u2019m pretty sure it wasn\u2019t a requirement for Helene (and, therefore, the other bloggers) to use this service before promoting it. She just doesn\u2019t promote products that she doesn\u2019t know and love.\nWhy am I telling you this?\nBecause influencers who promote products they haven\u2019t used don\u2019t deserve their audience.\nI\u2019d say it\u2019s pretty easy for you to make the connection there.\nRecommending a potentially bad product to people who trust you is unethical. If you do this, you\u2019re hurting yourself (and possibly your audience).\nI\u2019m not deleting my account. I love looking at gorgeous photos, and I think it\u2019s a great way to keep up with real-life and online friends. But the way I use Instagram will definitely be changing.\nTo end, I want to clarify that I have no issue with Instagram. I have an issue with people who abuse it, and I have an issue with how high the cost is to be an influencer on Instagram.\nSo, if you\u2019re a wannabe influencer (or you\u2019ve already \u201cmade it\u201d), ask yourself these questions:\nJust some food for thought.\nNote: Yes, it is ironic that I referenced Helene Sula \u2014 she\u2019s an Instagram expert, after all. But do you want to know the real reasons I follow her? Because she\u2019s authentic. Because she doesn\u2019t promote crap products just to get cash (and therefore I know I can trust her). Because her photos are beautiful.\n", "claps": "84 claps", "author": "Rebekah Joan", "comments": [], "link": "https://medium.com/@rjlbooks/giving-up-instagram-27fdaf76ce47"}, {"title": "Top 5 Social Media Monitoring Tools \u2013 Hacker Noon", "num_comments": "unspecified", "tags": ["social media", "marketing tools", "social media monitoring", "instagram", "marketing"], "reading_time": 7, "text": "I think very often.

In 2015, Mathias was a college student in South Carolina when she started a dedicated handle for Lionel, who had started to take over her personal account. A month in, she posted a photo of Lionel curled into a ball, sitting on top of a sprinkle-coated ice cream cone. \u201cOne scoop of spike cream please,\u201d she wrote.\nThe next day, Mathias was at a movie when her sister called repeatedly; she hurried out, thinking there was some kind of emergency. But no: Pop singer Joe Jonas had reposted her picture for his millions of followers. Overnight, Mathias\u2019s follower count leapt from roughly 1,000 to 8,000 and continued to snowball from there. Lionel made his way onto BuzzFeed listicles and the official Instagram account, where a photo of him sprawled in a little wooden chair has collected more than 1.4 million likes so far.\nToday Lionel and Lilo, another hedgehog Mathias purchased in 2017, have 136,000 followers. That number that pales in comparison with other Instagram-famous hedgehogs (Azuki, 405,000; Mr. Pokee, 1.3 million) and \u201cpetfluencers\u201d at large (Grumpy Cat, 2.4 million; Doug the Pug, 3.7 million; Nala Cat, 4 million). But it\u2019s sizeable enough for Mathias, who lives in Charleston and works as a social media manager for the boutique chain Lovely Bride. Over the last four years, Mathias, Lionel, and Lilo have been tapped by brands like Wayfair, Cadbury, and Two Hat Beer to create sponsored content. West Elm, one of Mathias\u2019s biggest partnerships to date, turned Lionel into a Christmas ornament benefitting the ASPCA.\nFor nearly two years, Mathias and her hedgehogs have been represented by The Dog Agency, a petfluencer talent firm that books campaigns and handles contracts for its clients. For a one-off post, Mathias typically charges at least $1,000, but she says that in the world of Instagram pets, \u201cI\u2019m a baby.\u201d Animals with bigger followings can make as much as $15,000 per post, Loni Edwards, owner of The Dog Agency, told Vox in an interview. (Edwards has not yet responded to my interview requests.)\nIn the United States alone, the Instagram influencer economy \u2014 wherein brands pay individuals with significant followings to post about their product \u2014 is expected to grow to $1.7 billion in 2019. That\u2019s up from an estimated $800 million in 2017, according to the influencer marketing firm Mediakix. As with food, fashion, and wellness influencers, petfluencing can be a well-paid part- or even full-time job.\nDogs and cats are a beloved though relatively common online staple, which helps explain why Lionel and Lilo are so popular: Hedgehogs are adorable \u2014 with their bulbous, spiky bodies and little faces \u2014 and unusual. Classified as exotic animals and illegal in certain parts of the country, they spark people\u2019s curiosity. And social media rewards novelty.\nOnline, every hedgehog has its own vibe: While some appear in elaborate or hyper-stylized miniature sets, others offer more \u201cnatural\u201d scenes. Mathias often takes iPhone photos of Lionel curled up in her outstretched hand against charming building exteriors. (Sponsored posts take more planning, and she is, it should be noted, constantly on the lookout for miniature hats to use in her photos.) Photoshoots don\u2019t happen every day, but Mathias says Lionel and Lilo are pretty cooperative when it\u2019s time to get to work. For one instant, they stop squirming and curl into a perfect little ball.\nHedgehogs, more than many animals, are a classic case of Instagram versus reality \u2014 the stark contrast between the exclusively beautiful, interesting version of life that people present on the app and the duller, more complicated world they actually live in. (With an abundance of fabricated existences to feel jealous of, it\u2019s no surprise that social media tends to make people feel worse about themselves.)\nOn Instagram, hedgehogs seem perfectly happy to pose on ice cream cones and play dress up in tiny hats, but in reality, they\u2019re nocturnal and notoriously shy, prone to curling up into spiky balls when they\u2019re feeling nervous. And they often have a cool, even prickly attitude toward humans. Writer Becca James says that her current three-year-old hedgehog, Uff Da, is more friendly than her previous hedgehog, Pop Vicious, but adds, \u201cI\u2019d never go as far as to say that they\u2019re affectionate.\u201d\n\u201cThey really want nothing to do with you because you\u2019re not the darkness. They\u2019re the gothest animals alive,\u201d says Tom, who recently took care of a friend\u2019s hedgehog for six months. (He asked to remain anonymous because hedgehogs are illegal in New York City, where he lives.) Still, he describes the time that the hedgehog fell asleep in his wife\u2019s hands after a bath as \u201cthe cutest thing I\u2019ve ever seen.\u201d When he posted about the hedgehog on Instagram, those pictures way out-performed the rest. \u201cLike, more likes than my wedding photos,\u201d Tom says.\nJoseph Hernandez, a Chicago-based travel editor at Thrillist, describes his hedgehog \u2014 Hedgewig the Angry Inch, inherited from a friend whose new dog didn\u2019t get along with the critter \u2014 as \u201cthe grumpy burrowing type who doesn\u2019t want or care to interact\u201d and \u201clike an old man shaking his fist at a cloud.\u201d\n\u201cMy partner and I are both grumpy gay guys, so we identify with him, but I think a lot of people think they\u2019re going to get these beautiful little Instagram hedgehogs that are ready to be put in tiny hats and dioramas,\u201d says Hernandez. \u201cI posted an [unflattering] Instagram story a few weeks ago that was like \u2018this is what the hedgehog looks like on most days\u2019 and tried to debunk it.\u201d\nThough hedgehog owners say they\u2019re remarkably low-maintenance pets, Instagram can also obfuscate aspects of their care that are challenging \u2014 like finding an exotic animal veterinarian when they get sick \u2014 and unsavory, like their bathroom habits. At night, when they\u2019re up and about, hedgehogs will run for hours. And when they run, they shit: James and Hernandez say their hedgehogs often coat their wheels in droppings. (\u201cIt\u2019s like when you\u2019re running a marathon,\u201d says James, referring to the sudden urge to empty one\u2019s bowels experienced by long-distance runners.) The solution is frequent, thorough baths and cage cleanings, with foot baths and surface wipe-downs in between.\nOf more concern, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention issued a notice in January 2019 about a 17-case outbreak of salmonella tied to pet hedgehogs, which can carry the bacteria in their feces. (This wasn\u2019t the first time salmonella was linked to hedgehog exposure.) The CDC encourages people to wash their hands thoroughly after interacting with hedgehogs and recommended that they not \u201ckiss or snuggle\u201d the creatures.\nChris Schindler, vice president of field services for Washington, D.C.\u2019s Humane Rescue Alliance, expressed concern that the way hedgehogs are portrayed on social media could encourage lax care, leading to pet abandonment and further salmonella cases. The Humane Rescue Alliance opposed a 2018 move to legalize the animals as pets in D.C. The legalization effort failed, though hedgehogs were legalized shortly thereafter in nearby Fairfax County, Virginia. But they\u2019re also currently banned in California, Georgia, Hawaii, New York\u2019s boroughs, and Pennsylvania.\n\u201cHedgehogs and small exotic animals are often impulse purchases, so when [people] see a video of them eating a tiny birthday cake with a hat, you\u2019re not actually getting that when you get your pet,\u201d says Schindler. \u201cSocial media has encouraged ownership of animals that isn\u2019t realistic for what they\u2019re going to end up with.\u201d\nAfter hearing that a few people had gotten hedgehogs because of Lionel, Mathias took it upon herself to post about the realities of hedgehog care on her website. \u201cThey\u2019re real animals and come with a lot of responsibility,\u201d she says.\nChristie Riddle, a Virginia-based hedgehog seller, and Tamara Sevigny, a hedgehog and sugar glider breeder based in Connecticut, say they try to thoroughly educate potential buyers on hedgehog care. Both say that less than 1% of their clients ultimately ask to return their hedgehogs. Even then, Sevigny says, it\u2019s mostly because of a move to a region where they aren\u2019t legal or a building that doesn\u2019t allow pets.\nAnd for some, the hedgehog\u2019s difficult, antisocial nature becomes part of their quirky charm. Brooke Bell, a Chicago-based hedgehog owner, theorizes that, as with cats, their apathy makes you want to work harder for their love. Mathias says that after she got Lionel, she fell in love with hedgehogs\u2019 ornery side. Riddle finds their skittishness endearing. Tom appreciates that hedgehogs make it clear where you stand with them.\n\u201cThese are not mixed signals,\u201d says Tom. \u201cI know the score. I know you don\u2019t like me. I know that I just think you\u2019re cute.\u201d\nOn a recent Monday, Becca James swaddled Uff Da in a navy blue hand towel and brought him to a small park in Brooklyn overlooking the East River. She set him on the ground, and off he went, lumbering across the pavement like small, locomotive loaf of bread.\nA pair of men came over, enchanted. A woman approached, carrying her dog, who strained forward to investigate this foreign creature. They cooed, they took pictures. Of course they did: With his round, quilled body, little snout, and bulbous black eyes, Uff Da is a magnet for the camera. A man in a black puffer jacket made a beeline for us while talking to someone on video chat; without missing a beat, he dropped to a crouch, flipped his phone camera around, and started filming the hedgehog for his friend\u2019s benefit, keeping up his conversation the whole time.\nUff Da seemed oblivious to the humans creating content out of his existence as well as a boisterous flock of pigeons that suddenly took flight. Instead, he huddled between the feet of a stranger, who froze with a look of rapture on her face. Uff Da seemed indifferent. But in the pictures, he looked delightful.\n", "claps": "983 claps", "author": "Eliza Brooke", "comments": [], "link": "https://onezero.medium.com/how-hedgehogs-became-instagrams-most-miserable-celebrities-5323aec461b4"}, {"title": "How I Eat For Free in NYC Using Python, Automation, Artificial Intelligence, and Instagram", "num_comments": 26, "tags": ["social media", "automation", "python", "instagram", "data science"], "reading_time": 22, "text": "Living and working in the big apple comes with big rent.\nI, along with most other city-dwellers who live inside a crammed closet we call an apartment, look to cut costs anywhere we can. It\u2019s no secret one way to curtail expenses, at least we\u2019re told, is to cook at home instead of eating out all of the time. As a Hell\u2019s Kitchen resident this is near impossible. Everywhere I look there is a sushi bar, Mexican restaurant or some delicious looking pizzeria within arm\u2019s length that can break my willpower in the blink of an eye. I fall victim to this way more than I\u2019d like to admit. Well, I used to fall victim to this \u2014 until recently. Not wanting to give up the dining experiences I enjoyed so dearly, I decided I\u2019d create my own currency to finance these transactions. I\u2019ve been dining at restaurants, sandwich shops, and other eateries for free ever since.\nI\u2019m going to explain to you how I\u2019m receiving these free meals from some of the best restaurants in New York City. I\u2019ll admit \u2014 it\u2019s rather technical and not everyone can reproduce my methodology. You\u2019ll either need a background in Data Science/Software Development or a lot of free time on your hands. Since I have the prior, I sit back and let my code do the work for me. Oh, and you guessed it, you\u2019ll need to know how to use Instagram as well.\nIf you\u2019re part of the technical audience, I will briefly go over some of the technologies and programming languages I use but I will not be providing code or anything like that. I will explain my use of logistic regression, random forests, AWS, and automation \u2014 but not in depth. This article will be more theory based. If you\u2019re a non-technical reader, everything here can still be done, it\u2019s just going to take some time and effort. These methods are tedious which is why I decided to automate most of them.\nNow to get into it. I\u2019ll start with the answer and then go through how I got there.\nIn today\u2019s digital age, a large Instagram audience is considered a valuable currency. I had also heard through the grapevine that I could monetize a large following \u2014 or in my desired case \u2014 use it to have my meals paid for. So I did just that.\nI created an Instagram page that showcased pictures of New York City\u2019s skylines, iconic spots, elegant skyscrapers \u2014 you name it. The page has amassed a following of over 25,000 users in the NYC area and it\u2019s still rapidly growing.\nI reach out restaurants in the area either via Instagram\u2019s direct messaging or email and offer to post a review to my followers in return for a free entree or at least a discount. Almost every restaurant I\u2019ve messaged came back at me with a compensated meal or a gift card. Most places have an allocated marketing budget for these types of things so they were happy to offer me a free dining experience in exchange for a potential promotion. I\u2019ve ended up giving some of these meals away to my friends and family because at times I had too many queued up to use myself.\nThe beauty of this all is that I automated the whole thing. And I mean 100% of it. I wrote code that finds these pictures or videos, makes a caption, adds hashtags, credits where the picture or video comes from, weeds out bad or spammy posts, posts them, follows and unfollows users, likes pictures, monitors my inbox, and most importantly \u2014 both direct messages and emails restaurants about a potential promotion. Since its inception, I haven\u2019t even really logged into the account. I spend zero time on it. It\u2019s essentially a robot that operates like a human, but the average viewer can\u2019t tell the difference. And as the programmer, I get to sit back and admire its (and my) work.\nI\u2019ll walk you through how I did what I did, from A all the way to Z. Some of this may seem like common sense, but when you\u2019re automating a system to act like a human, details are important. The process can be broken down into three phases: content sharing, growth hacking, and sales & promotion.\nNow, none of the content my account posts is owned by me. I re-share other peoples content on my page, with credit to them. If someone asks me to take down their photo, I do immediately. But since I am sourcing their page, I\u2019ve only been thanked \u2014 never the opposite.\nPosting every day \u2014 multiple times a day \u2014 is indispensable. This is one of the main factors the Instagram algorithm uses to determine how much they are going to expose you to the public (via the \u201cexplore page\u201d). Posting every day, especially at \u201crush hour\u201d times, is much harder and more monotonous than you might think. Most people give up on this task after a few weeks, and even missing a day or two can be detrimental. So, I automated the content collecting and sharing process.\nI first thought about setting up a picture scraper from Google Images or from Reddit to get my content. One of the biggest struggles I came across was how particular Instagram is with the sizing of the picture being posted. Ideally, it\u2019s a \u201csquare\u201d picture, meaning its width equals its height, so it will reject an out-of-proportion post attempt. This made retrieving content very challenging.\nI ultimately decided to scrape directly from other Instagram feeds because the picture will come in precisely the right size as it is. It also allows me to know exactly where the picture came from, which will come in handy during the auto-crediting process.\nI collected a list of fifty other Instagram accounts that posted quality pictures of NYC. Using some opensource software, I set up a scraper to go through and download media from these other accounts. In addition to the actual content, I scraped a bunch of metadata along with the picture such as the caption, the number of likes, and the location. I set the scraper to run every morning at 3:00 AM or when my inventory was empty.\nFrom this, I now have a central location with related content in the right format.\nNot everything someone posts on Instagram is re-sharable. A lot of the time people are trying to sell something, shouting another page, or it could flat out just be bad or unrelated content. Take these two posts as an example:\nThe above two posts are from the same NYC-based Instagram account. The one on the left is a normal natural post in their niche \u2014 one I would be happy re-sharing on my page. The one on the right, however, is an advertisement. Without any context, if I put this on my page it would be rather confusing and out of place. The caption got cut off, but it\u2019s actually promoting a NYC-based app. You can see the difference in the number of likes \u2014 8200 vs. 1000. I need to be able to automatically weed out posts like those on the right, and re-share posts like that of the left.\nTherefore, I can\u2019t just blindly re-share all the content that I scrape. And since this will be an automated process, I needed to create an algorithm that can weed out the bad from the good. The first part of my \u201ccleaner\u201d has some hard-coded rules and the second is a machine learning model that refines the content even further.\nCleaner Part 1 \u2014 Hard Coded Rules:\nThe first thing I did was refine my inventory on some specific guidelines from the metadata. I was rather strict because there is no shortage of content for me to share. If there was even a slight red-flag, I trashed the picture. I can always scrape more content, but if my algorithm posts something spammy or inappropriate to my page there may be thousands of people that see it before I recognize and remove it.\nThe preliminary step was to have my algorithm look at the caption. If the text includes any text related to \u201clink in bio\u201d, \u201cbuy now\u201d, \u201climited time\u201d, or the related, I immediately have it fail the test. These are typical of posts looking to sell something rather than quality content for entertainment purposes.\nThe next thing I looked at is if the comments were disabled. If they were, I failed the picture. Disabled comments from my experience were linked to controversial posts and not worth the risk.\nThe final thing I looked at was if there was more than one person tagged in the picture. A lot of the times, one tag in a picture is a credit to where it came from, so I actually found that to be beneficial. But if the picture had multiple tags, It would lead to confusion when it came to crediting or what the purpose of the post even was.\nFrom these rules, I was able to get most of the spammy and undesirable posts into the trash and out of my folder. However, just because a post isn\u2019t trying to sell something doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s a good, quality post. Also, my hard-coded rules may still miss some sales-y content, so I wanted to run them through a secondary model once I was done with part one.\nCleaner Part 2\u2014 Machine Learning Model:\nAs I was going through my now-cleaner repository of pictures, I noticed there were still some lingering items that weren\u2019t particularly desirable to post. I wasn\u2019t going to be able to sit there and manually move out the bad ones as I planned for this to be completely automated. I wanted to run each through another test.\nI had a ton of metadata on each of the posts, including the number of likes, captions, time of post, and much more. My original goal was to try to predict which pictures would garner the most likes. However, the issue was that bigger accounts naturally had more likes so it wasn\u2019t a fair barometer. My follow-up thought would be to make the response variable equal to the like ratio (number of likes/number of followers) and try to predict that. After looking at each picture and its respective ratio, I still didn\u2019t trust the correlation. I didn\u2019t feel those with higher ratios were necessarily the best photos. Just because an account was \u201cpopular\u201d didn\u2019t mean it had better content than a relatively unknown photographer with fewer likes. I decided to change my outlook from a regression model to a classification model and just decide if the picture is good enough to post or not \u2014 a simple yes or no.\nBefore even looking at any of the other metadata, I scraped a large number of photos and manually went through them, labeling them as 0 (bad) or 1 (good). This is extremely subjective, so I\u2019m theoretically making a model to my own conscious. However, it seems to be pretty universally agreed upon as to which content is unappealing and which is favorable.\nI generated my own dataset. The response variable was 0/1 (bad/good) with a large number of features. The metadata of each post gave me the following information:\nFrom these seven explanatory variables, I engineered a few more features that I thought would be useful. For example, I changed the number of comments and likes to ratios against followers. I extracted the number of hashtags from the caption and made that its own column, and did the same with the number of accounts mentioned in the caption. I cleaned up and vectorized the rest of the caption to be used in Natural Language Processing. Vectorizing is the process of removing peripheral words (\u201cthe\u201d, \u201cand\u201d, etc.) and converting the remaining into a numeric field that can be analyzed mathematically. After all was said and done, I had the resulting data:\nI played around with a number of classification algorithms such as Support Vector Machines and Random Forests but landed on a basic Logistic Regression. I did this for a few reasons, first being Occam\u2019s Razor \u2014 sometimes the simplest answer is the right one. No matter which way I spun or re-engineered the data, logistic regression performed the best on my test set. The second and more important reason was that, unlike some other classification algorithms, I can set a threshold score while making predictions. It\u2019s common for classification algorithms to output a binary class (in my case 0 or 1) but logistic regression actually yields a decimal between 0 and 1. For example, it may rate a post as 0.83 or 0.12. It\u2019s common to set the threshold at 0.5 and rank everything greater than that to 1 and everything else to 0, but it would be case dependent. Since this task is critical, and there is an abundance of media available, I was extremely strict on my threshold and set it to 0.9 and rejected anything that fell below that benchmark.\nAfter I implemented my model, the inventory of pictures and videos was A) cleaned by a hard set of rules and then B) only the cream of the crop was chosen by my logistic regression algorithm. I am now able to move on to captioning and crediting each post.\nI now had a system of automatically gathering relevant content and removing the tangential or spammy images\u2014 but I\u2019m not done yet.\nIf you\u2019ve used Instagram before, you know that each post has a caption that exists under the picture or video. Being that I can\u2019t actually see these pictures, nor do I have the time to sit there and caption them all, I needed to make a generic caption that can be used for any of them.\nThe first thing I did was make a final template. It looked something like this:\nWhere the three sets of {}\u2019s needed to be filled in by my script. Let\u2019s go through each three one-by-one.\nI created a text file with a number of predefined generic captions that could go with any picture. These were either quotes about NYC, broad questions, or just basic praise. Some of these included:\nFor each post, one of my captions was randomly chosen. I have such a large list that I\u2019m not worried about them being used too often or overlapping. So, for our example, let\u2019s pick the first one \u2014 \u201cWho can name this spot?\u201d.\n2. Credit\nThis was one of the harder tasks \u2014 automatically crediting the source. What was particularly tricky was that the Instagram page that the media came from wasn\u2019t necessarily the right person to credit. Often, that account was also re-sharing the content and crediting the owner in their caption or tagging them in the photo.\nI decided I would credit the page where it came from no matter what. I would then add more credits if I could possibly decipher the original owner as well. I felt I would cover all of my bases this way.\nLet\u2019s take a look at this post by @likenewyorkcity on Instagram. We can see that even though he or she was the one who shared it, the real owner is @geoffrey.parry who is tagged in the picture and mentioned in the caption.\nIdeally, I would like my code to be able to look at this picture and return:\nThe first part of that is easy; just inputting which account it came from. The second part was a little more challenging.\nI used REGEX to look for a number of keywords such as \u201cby\u201d or \u201cphoto:\u201d and then look for the \u201c@\u201d symbol that followed right after. From there, I grabbed the username and believed that to be the second part of my credit.\nIf none of those keywords existed in the caption, I checked if there was anyone tagged in the picture. If there was, I figured they deserved the credit. I understand this is an imperfect method, but more times than not that\u2019s why someone was tagged and it was a risk worth taking.\nI very often capture exactly the right credit. In fact, many times I\u2019ve had people comment on my pictures and say \u201cthank you for sharing!\u201d (I\u2019ve added an example of that below).\n3. Hashtags\nInstagram allows you to add 30 hashtags to your picture which will then be displayed on that hashtag\u2019s feed. I created a file with over 100 related hashes:\nand randomly chose 30 to add each time. I did that so after a while, I can compare which hashtags lead me to a greater number of likes.\n4. Final Template\nAfter the three steps were said and done, I was able to fill in my template and have a caption that can go along with any post.\nHere\u2019s an example of one of my final products:\nI used a generic caption that could go with any picture of NYC. I credited both the Instagram account it came from and the original source. If you look at the comments, you can see the original owner thanking me for sharing. And I added thirty hashtags to boost my post as well.\nI now have a central repository of relevant media and a process of generating a caption for each of these posts. Now, it\u2019s time to do just that \u2014 post.\nI spun up an EC2 instance on AWS to host my code. I chose this route because it\u2019s more reliable than my personal machine \u2014 it\u2019s always on and connected to the internet and I knew it would all fit under the free-tier limits.\nI wrote a Python script that randomly grabs one of these pictures and auto-generates a caption after the scraping and cleaning process is completed. Using my API, I was able to write code that does the actual posting for me. I scheduled a cron-job to run around 8:00 AM, 2:00 PM, and 7:30 PM every day.\nAt this point, I\u2019ve completely automated the content finding and posting process. I no longer have to worry about finding media and posting every day, it\u2019s being done for me.\nIt isn\u2019t enough to just post \u2014 I need to enact some methodologies to grow my following as well. And since I won\u2019t ever be on the account myself doing any of this manually, I\u2019ll need to automate that too. The idea was to get my account exposed to an interested audience by interacting directly with those people.\nThe interaction script that I wrote runs from 10:00 AM to 7:00 PM EST, the time range that I believed Instagram to be most active. Throughout the day, my account methodically follows, unfollows, and likes relevant users and photos in order to have the same be done back to me.\nFollowing (More Data Science)\nIf you use Instagram, I\u2019m sure you\u2019ve been part of this before whether you realize it or not. This method is very common for accounts that are trying to increase their following. One day you follow an interesting Instagram page in the fitness niche, and the next day you\u2019re being followed by a bunch of bodybuilders and fitness models. This seems extremely trivial, and it is, but it\u2019s very effective.\nThe issue here is that you can\u2019t just follow willy-nilly on Instagram. Their algorithm is very very strict, so they will cut you off or even ban your account if you go overboard and follow too many accounts in one day. Additionally, you can be following at most 7,500 users at one time on Instagram. After a lot of testing, I\u2019ve found you can get away with following 400 people and unfollowing 400 people in a single day. Therefore, each follow is extremely precious. You don\u2019t want to waste a follow on someone who is unlikely to follow you back because you only have so many users that you can follow in one day. I decided to capture the metadata of my activity and make a model to predict how likely someone would be to follow you back, so I wouldn\u2019t waste a precious follow on someone who was unlikely to return the favor.\nI spent a few minutes manually gathering 20+ bigger accounts in the same niche as me. I had no initial data, so the first few weeks would be me randomly performing these actions to grow my following, but more importantly, I needed to capture as much metadata as possible so I can make my model.\nI cycled through these 20+ related accounts and followed the users who followed them, liked their pictures, or commented on their posts. With each follow I captured as much metadata as possible about the user into a CSV file. Some of this metadata included their follower/following ratio, if they were public or private, or if they had a profile picture or not.\nEvery day, my script would go through this CSV and label the missing response variable, which is if they followed back or not. I gave each user two full days before labeling him or her 0, 1, or 2 \u2014 2 being the most desirable outcome. 0 indicated that the user did not follow back, 1 indicated that they followed back but didn\u2019t interact with me in my last ten pictures (liking or commenting), and 2 indicated if they followed back AND interacted on one of my last ten posts. My dataset looked something like this:\nBefore running this data through a ML model, I did some exploratory data analysis and found that:\nFrom just the above insights, I was able to refine my initial search of users. I adjusted my settings to only follow in the morning and to look primarily for females. Now I was finally able to make a machine learning model to predict the likelihood of a follow back based on a user\u2019s metadata before interacting with them. This allows me to not waste one of my already limited daily follows on someone who has a very small chance of following me back.\nI chose to use the Random Forest algorithm to classify the follow back outcome. I originally was using a number of different decision trees before I had a set structure or outcome variable because I wanted to see the visual flowcharts that come along with them. The Random Forest is an enhancement of the decision tree that provides a number of tweaks to correct many of the inconsistencies in the individual trees. I was consistently seeing an accuracy of over 80% on my test data after modeling to my training data, so it was an effective model for me. I implemented this in my code on my scraped users to optimize follow usage and saw tremendous growth in my following.\nUnfollowing\nAfter two days, I would unfollow the people I had followed. This gave me enough time to capture if they would follow me back or not. This allowed me to collect data to continue to grow.\nYou have to unfollow the people you follow for two reasons. The first is that you cannot be following over 7,500 people at any time. The second is because \u2014 although artificial \u2014 you want to have your follower/following ratio as high as possible as it is a sign of a more desirable account.\nThis is an easy task because there aren\u2019t any decisions that need to be made. You follow 400 people in a day, and two days later you unfollow those exact people.\nLiking\nLiking can also supplement your account. I didn\u2019t put nearly as much effort in choosing the pictures to like as liking isn\u2019t proven to give you that much of gain in followers compared to the following method described above. I simply gave a predefined set of hashtags, looped through their feeds, and liked the pictures in hopes those users would return the favor.\nAt this point, I have a complete self-sustaining robotic Instagram. My NYC page, on its own, is finding relevant content, weeding out bad potential posts, generating credits and a caption, and posting throughout the day. In addition, from 7:00 AM to 10:00 PM, it is growing its presence by automatically liking, following, and unfollowing with an intrigued audience which has been further redefined by some data science algorithms. The best part is that it seems more human than most accounts in the same niche.\nFor a month or two, I sat back and watched my product grow. I would see an increase of anywhere between 100 and 500 followers a day all the while enjoying some beautiful pictures of the city I love.\nI was able to go about my life; work at my job, go out with friends, see a movie\u2014 never having to worry about spending any time manually growing my page. It had the formula to do its thing while I did my thing.\nOnce I had 20,000 followers I decided it was time to use this page to get some free meals. Again, I automated my sales pitch too.\nI made a direct message template which I tried to keep as generic as possible. I wanted to be able to use the same message whether it was a restaurant, a theatre, a museum, or a store. This is what I came up with:\nHere, I just need to impute the account name and the number of followers I have at the time of the message.\nMy goal was to find business Instagrams and give them my pitch. A business profile is slightly different from a normal one \u2014 it allows the user to add their email, phone number, directions, and other buttons on their page. But most importantly, they have a category label right on their profile.\nThe above is an example of a business profile. Right under the name in the top left, it says \u201cKorean Restaurant\u201d and it has call-to-action buttons such as call, email, and directions at the top.\nI wrote a Python script that looks for these pages and automatically sends them a message from my account. The script takes two parameters, a starting hashtag, and a string to look for in the category label. In my case, I used the hashtag \u201cManhattan\u201d and the string \u201crestaurant\u201d.\nWhat this script does is it goes to the hashtag feed and loads a bunch of photos. It then loops through the posts until it hits one that has users tagged in the photo. If it does, it goes into the tags and checks if they are a business page. If it is, it looks at the category. If the category includes the word \u201crestaurant\u201d, it sends them my message. The nice part about business profiles is that they often have emails on their page. If they do, I automatically send them an email follow-up to my Instagram direct message. I can change the hashtag to something like #TimesSquare and I can change the string to something like \u201cmuseum\u201d if my goals change down the road.\nIf I go into my account, I will see the message that it auto-generated and sent.\nAnd if I go to my Gmail outbox, I\u2019ll see:\nFinally, I have a script that monitors my inbox for any responses and alerts me if so. If there is a response, I finally do some manual work and negotiate with my potential client.\nAlong with the posting process and the growth process, this runs throughout the day without the need for any human manipulation.\nThe results are better than you might initially imagine. I have restaurants basically throwing gift cards and free meals my way in exchange for an Instagram promotion.\nDue to the power of AI, automation, and data science \u2014 I am able to sit back and relax while my code does the work for me. It acts as a source of entertainment while at the same time being my salesman.\nI hope this helps inspire some creativity when it comes to social media. Anyone can use these methods whether they are technical enough to automate or if they need to do it by hand. Instagram is a powerful tool and can be used for a variety of business benefits.\nFeel free to reach out with any questions!\ncrb4595@gmail.com\nwww.linkedin.com/in/chris-buetti/\nwww.digitalprezence.com\n", "claps": "5.3K claps", "author": "Chris Buetti", "comments": ["S A V A G E", "Awesome write up and genius idea", "Well done sir, nice application of these techniques.

We can hold it. We trade it for goods and services. It\u2019s \u201cbacked\u201d by the government. Everyone agrees on its value making the economy seemingly real.\nIn literal terms, however, the value of money is completely imaginary.\nIf for some reason, hordes of people began to stop believing in the value of money, the economy as we know it would come to a halt.\nThe same thinking applies to laws. They\u2019re enforced. The government believes in them. Most of us follow them. But laws are nothing more than made up agreements on what\u2019s right and wrong the people more or less agree to.\nLaws, money, cultural norms, and many other things we believe are real are nothing more than\u201cimagined orders.\u201d\nYuval Noah Harari coined this term in the book Sapiens \u2014 a Brief History of Human Kind. The book discusses the idea that the advancement of the human race came from our ability to make things up and agree to their validity.\nThis is how there can be a Christian church in Boise, Idaho and in distant countries like Lebanon. It\u2019s how someone in Switzerland can do business with someone in South Africa.\nShared beliefs tie us together.Not just because of our agreement, but because of our belief in our beliefs being part of some natural order or definitive reality.\nLet\u2019s put aside religion as I don\u2019t want to get touchy, but when looking at something like money or laws, we believe in them as if they\u2019re scientific laws that are etched in stone when they\u2019re not.\nAgain, let\u2019s hammer this point home \u2014 most of the things we define as real are, in fact, completely imaginary.\nI bet you\u2019re wondering why I\u2019m bringing all of this up...\nI\u2019m bringing it up because one reason why you may not be achieving what you want to achieve in life is that your definitions of \u201creal\u201d and \u201cpossible\u201d are much too rigid. It\u2019s time to loosen them up.\nThis example gets used a lot, but it\u2019s so powerful and illustrative.\nYou\u2019ve heard the story before. At one point in time, the idea of a person running the four-minute mile was at best ludicrous and many believed it to be impossible.\nEnter Roger Bannister. Bannister broke the four-minute mile mark and soon after that....tons of other runners did too. Today, there are high school athletes who run sub-four-minute miles.\nAfter Bannister broke the mark, the legs of other runners didn\u2019t magically get stronger. There wasn\u2019t a sudden shift in their genetic makeup. No, all it took was the belief it was possible.\nOnce one brave soul sought to crack a hole in reality, others gladly ran through it.\nWhen looking at your life, consider what limitations you\u2019re putting on what\u2019s possible.\nWhat\u2019s something you think is impossible for you?\nMaybe it\u2019s something like earning one million dollars. Sure, you know it\u2019s technically possible, but remember our beliefs about what is and isn\u2019t possible or is and isn\u2019t real get hammered into our brain so deeply we actually take it as fact.\nThe easiest way to take an impossible task and make it appear possible is to break it down to it\u2019s simplest components.\nTo make one million dollars in a year, you\u2019d need to make $2,739.73 per day.\nTo make $2,739.73 per day, you\u2019d need to make $114.16 per hour.\nWith something like an online business that shares a product across the globe, it could sell 24 hours per day.\nIs it in the realm of reality to have a $60 product you sell 2 of per hour around the clock? If you have a website and build up some traffic for it, sure.\n2 $60 products per hour seems a lot more doable than $1,000,000 a year, doesn\u2019t it?\nIt\u2019s all about the way you analyze and think about your reality.\nI\u2019m not a millionaire, by the way, but I\u2019ve realized making money online isn\u2019t as difficult as it appears when you break it down and the million dollars example is fitting.\nWhen you think of a task that looks \u201cimpossible\u201d pause and use these filters to get to the truth\nIs it in the realm of reality for someone with your level of intelligence to pull this off? The answer is yes.\nAnother example. You have no degree and no money to go back to school but you want to get a better paying job. The job says it \u201crequires a 4-year degree and 3\u20135 years experience.\u201d\nMost people look at that as iron-clad but I personally know people who\u2019ve gotten around it. The employer uses those requirements because they need a credible candidate.\nThere are other ways to prove you\u2019re credible. If you took free online computer programming classes, became a whiz, built a stellar website to use as an example, wrote a document detailing how you\u2019d improve the technical processes of their company over the next 6 months, and submitted it to that same employer \u201crequiring experience,\u201d you could easily get the job.\nAny personal development idea or message leads back to the beginning. You have to start. As Nelson Mandela said, \u201cIt always looks impossible until it\u2019s done.\u201d\nI want you to do me a favor.

Sources of intelligence can be measured in quotients. Most of us are familiar with IQ, or the intelligence quotient, which is primarily associated with our ability to memorize, retrieve items from our memory and our logical reasoning.\nThere\u2019s also a new up and comer, CQ, or curiosity quotient, which refers to one\u2019s ability to have a powerful motivation to learn a particular subject. What I spend much of my time in both research, and in working with clients and organizations on, is focusing on emotional intelligence.\nThe definition of emotional intelligence (as first advanced by researchers Peter Salovey \u2014 current President of Yale University \u2014 and John Mayer, but popularized by author Daniel Goleman in his seminal, eponymous book) is the ability to:\nWe are emotional creatures who often make decisions and respond to stimuli based on our emotions. As a result, our ability to grow in EQ has an enormous impact in all of our relationships, how we make decisions and identify opportunities. EQ is enormously important. Through my work, I\u2019ve identified 10 qualities that I believe comprise the emotionally intelligent person.\nI hope you gain value from this and learn to understand the ways you can influence your mind, and the minds of others, by growing emotionally every day, in all that you do.\nI love this definition of empathy:\nThere are two different types of empathy. This piece from the Greater Good Science Center at UC Berkeley beautifully depicts what they are:\nWe empathize based on the reaction to others. What I\u2019d also say is that empathy can be cultivated and learned through experiences. Store away in your memory those feelings that you feel both in reaction, and as you put things in perspective. Write these thoughts out, analyze them and determine how you want to treat others in the same way you\u2019d want to be treated.\nSelf-awareness is the art of understanding yourself, recognizing what stimuli you\u2019re facing and then preparing for how to manage yourself both in a proactive and reactive manner. Self-awareness is how we see ourselves, and also how we perceive others to see us. The second, external aspect, is always the most difficult to properly assess.\nDr. Tasha Eurich puts forth:\nFor yourself, ask the introspective questions, yearn for knowledge and be curious. And for others, seek feedback in an honest, caring environment.\nShow me a curious person who\u2019s willing to learn and improve, and I\u2019ll show you a success story waiting to happen. When you\u2019re curious, you\u2019re passionate, and when you\u2019re passionate you are driven to want to be your best. Your \u201cantennae\u201d are up to things you love, to wanting to grow and learn more. This learning mindset positively affects other areas of your life like relationships.\nTomas Chamorro-Premusic writes:\nThe most emotionally intelligent and resolute people are deep-thinkers that analyze and process all new information that comes their way. They continue to analyze old information, habits and ways of doing things to see if they can extract ways to improve. We\u2019re all \u201canalysts\u201d in the sense that we consciously think about all new information that comes our way.\nSavvy EQ individuals are problem-solvers and everyday philosophers who contemplate the \u201cWhy\u201d of existence, the \u201cWhy\u201d of why we do what we do, and who care passionately about living a virtuous life. Having an analytical mind means having a healthy appetite for a continuously improving mindset geared at bettering yourself and always remaining open to new ideas.\nA major component of maintaining emotional self-control is using the power of faith to believe in yourself both in the present and in the future. It\u2019s believing that the people and things in your life are there for a reason, and that everything will ultimately work out for good.\nFaith alone will not help you. It takes action, of course. But when you combine faith with powerful values like hard work, perseverance and a positive attitude, you have formed the foundation of a champion. Every great leader and thinker uses faith, either in a practical context, emotionally and certainly spiritually.\nSpend time in meditation. Think about the way you believe in yourself. Engender a greater faith toward the person you are and who you want to become. And trust and believe that the pieces in your life will come together in a way that will help you live boldly and joyfully.\nThe emotionally intelligent mind is able to discern between things that they need versus things that would be \u201cnice to have\u201d that classify more aptly as wants. A need, particularly in the context of Abraham Maslow\u2019s \u201cHierarchy of Needs,\u201d is the basic-level stuff like safety, survival and sustenance. Once those things are met, then we can progress to other needs and of course, wants.\nA \u201cwant\u201d is a big house, nice car, and even the brand new iPhone. We do not need those things to survive, but rather we want them based on our own personal desires or what we perceive to matter to society. Become well-versed in knowing what you truly need to to live, to accomplish goals and to support yourself and loved ones. Make sure you draw a very clear distinction between what it is you need, and what it is you want.\nEmotionally intelligent people know the difference between these two things, and always establish needs prior to fulfilling wants.\nInspired leadership and love for what you do is born from having a passion for a subject or people. People with a high EQ use their passion and purpose to ignite the engine that drives them to do what they do. This passion is infectious and contagious \u2014 it permeates all areas of their lives and rubs off on the people around them.\nPassion is sort of that je ne sais quoi that when you feel it, or even when you see it in others, you simply know. Passion is the natural desire, instinct, drive, ambition and motivated love for a subject or someone. Passion brings positive energy that helps sustain us and inspire us to want to keep going. And there\u2019s no secret that emotionally intelligent people who are passionate are also willing to persevere and power forward no matter their circumstances.\nIf you want to increase your opportunities, improve your relationships and think clearly and constructively, you\u2019re best positioned to maintain a positive attitude. Of all the things that we try to control and influence, our attitude is the primary thing that is always within our control. We can choose to live each day by being positive. It\u2019s that simple.\nEmotionally intelligent people recognize when to continue their course, and when it\u2019s time for a change. This vitally important recognition and ability to make crisp, swift decisions in your best interest is called adaptability. You must determine when to stay the course, or when to keep moving forward in another direction.\nSimilarly, when one strategy is not working, try evaluating and determining if something else will work. From the way you treat yourself, to how you treat others, to your daily routine, always stay open-minded and be willing to adapt and introduce new elements to how you think and what you do.\nThroughout your life, you\u2019ll need to change course and make assessments on whether you\u2019ll be happy and successful if you choose one path or another. Recognize that you CAN always change. You can always start over. It may not always be the most prudent or wise decision, but only you will truly know in your heart what is or what isn\u2019t. Start with leaving the option on the table.\nLast but not least, an emotionally intelligent person is interested in overall success and achievement \u2014 not just for themselves, but for their peers. Their inspired leadership and passion, combined with their optimism, drives them to want to do best for themselves AND others.\nToo often, we get so self-absorbed and concerned only with \u201cWIIFM,\u201d or \u2014 What\u2019s in it for me? We have to be concerned about this. It\u2019s a must, so don\u2019t let anyone ever convince you otherwise. But in the same way that we should be focused on our self-interest, we should also maintain a spirit of desire and hope for wanting to see the people around us succeed.\nNot only is this a brilliant safeguard against envy and greed, it also revitalizes our passion and drives us toward achieving our next goal. It helps us gain allies and builds powerful relationships that come back to help us in reciprocal fashion.\nJoin my newsletter for emotional intelligence and productivity content!\nCheck out my Amazon bestseller, The Value of You, which has helped tens of thousands of people develop the game plan for living their best life!\n", "claps": "44K claps", "author": "Christopher D.

We as humans are always enthralled by animated and interactive charts rather than the static ones. Animations make even more sense when depicting time series data like stock prices over the years, climate change over the past decade, seasonalities and trends since we can then see how a particular parameter behaves with time.\nThe above image is a simulation of Rain and has been achieved with Matplotlib library which is fondly known as the grandfather of python visualization packages. Matplotlib simulates raindrops on a surface by animating the scale and opacity of 50 scatter points. Today Python boasts of a large number of powerful visualisation tools like Plotly, Bokeh, Altair to name a few. These libraries are able to achieve state of the art animations and interactiveness. Nonetheless, the aim of this article is to highlight one aspect of this library which isn\u2019t explored much and that is Animations and we are going to look at some of the ways of doing that.\nMatplotlib is a Python 2D plotting library and also the most popular one. Most of the people start their Data Visualisation journey with Matplotlib. One can generate plots, histograms, power spectra, bar charts, error charts, scatterplots, etc easily with matplotlib. It also integrates seamlessly with libraries like Pandas and Seaborn to create even more sophisticated visualisations.\nSome of the nice features of matplotlib are:\nHowever, there are also areas where Matplotlib doesn\u2019t shine out so much and lags behind its powerful counterparts.\nAs for a refresher here is a Matplotlib Cheat sheet from Datacamp which you can go through to brush up your basics.\nMatplotlib\u2019s animation base class deals with the animation part. It provides a framework around which the animation functionality is built. There are two main interfaces to achieve that using:\nFuncAnimation makes an animation by repeatedly calling a function func.\nArtistAnimation: Animation using a fixed set of Artist objects.\nHowever, out of the two, FuncAnimation is the most convenient one to use. You can read more about them in the documentation since we will only concern ourselves with the FuncAnimation tool.\nOnce ready, we can begin with our first basic animation in the Jupyter Notebooks. The code for this article can be accessed from the associated Github Repository or you can view it on my binder by clicking the image below.\nLet\u2019s use FuncAnimation to create a basic animation of a sine wave moving across the screen. The source code for the animation has been taken from the Matplotlib Animation tutorial. Let\u2019s first see the output and then we shall break down the code to understand what\u2019s going under the hood.\nThis is the basic intuition behind creating animations in Matplotlib. With a little tweak in the code, interesting visualisations can be created. Let\u2019s have a look at some of them\nSimilarly, there is a nice example of creating shapes at GeeksforGeeks. Let\u2019s now create a moving coil which slowly unwinds, with the help of animation class of matplotlib. The code is quite similar to the sine wave plot with minor adjustments.\nLive updating graphs come in handy when plotting dynamic quantities like stock data, sensor data or any other time-dependent data. We plot a base graph which automatically gets updated as more data is fed into the system. Let\u2019s plot stock prices of a hypothetical company in a month.\nNow, open the terminal and run the python file. You will get a graph like the one below which automatically updates as follows:\nHere interval is 1000 milliseconds or one second.\nCreating 3D graphs is common but what if we can animate the angle of view of those graphs. The idea is to change the camera view and then use every resulting image to create an animation. There is a nice section dedicated to it at The Python Graph Gallery.\nCreate a folder called volcano in the same directory as the notebook. All the images will be stored in this folder which will be then used in the animation.\nThis will create multiple PNG files in the Volcano folder. Now, use ImageMagick to transform them into animation. Open Terminal and navigate to the Volcano folder and enter the following command:\nCelluloid is a Python module that simplifies the process of creating animations in matplotlib. This library creates a matplotlib figure and creates a Camera from it. It then reuses figure and after each frame is created, take a snapshot with the camera. Finally, an animation is created with all the captured frames.\nHere are a few examples using the Celluloid module.\nAnimations help to highlight certain features of the visualisation which otherwise cannot be communicated easily with static charts. Having said that it is also important to keep in mind that unnecessary and overuse of visualisations can sometimes complicate things. Every feature in data visualisation should be used judiciously to have the best impact.\n", "claps": "1.3K claps", "author": "Parul Pandey", "comments": ["Hello, Parul.

I had just returned from a decade of travelling, had no contacts or experience in the film industry, and had never set foot on a film set.\nI knew I wanted to be a writer, but I wasn\u2019t sure what sort of a writer. I\u2019d dabbled in travel writing, creative non-fiction and had a couple of unfinished novels. My mother enrolled me in a screenwriting course \u2014 most likely as a way to keep me in the country. I\u2019d studied film 10 years earlier, but I didn\u2019t know yet that I would fall in love with screenwriting.\nAfter graduating, I took a few months off to polish my screenplay. And then I reached the inevitable question: WHAT DO I DO NOW?\nAt film school, no one gave us very helpful advice about what to do with a finished screenplay \u2014 because no one really has the answer. There are no straightforward paths to becoming a screenwriter. No one ever told us we could make a film ourselves.\nOur teacher mentioned pitching to producers (whoever they are) and submitting to screenplay contests (along with literal thousands of other screenplays). He had been shopping the same screenplay to producers for 20 years.\nTwenty years.\nI felt like I was already a decade behind my peers, because of the time I spent travelling. I couldn\u2019t fathom spending the next 20 years trying to convince someone else to turn my screenplay into a film. But a screenplay that is not a film simply doesn\u2019t exist. Unlike a novel, it is not an end product in and of itself.\nNot knowing any producers, I didn\u2019t have a clue where to even start pitching my screenplay. I also didn\u2019t have a clue how to start making a movie. But at least if I did it myself, I could guarantee a completed film \u2014 and in much less than 20 years.\nThe point is, if I can do it then anyone can. Knowing nothing about filmmaking myself, I had to find other people who did. All the rest is project management \u2014 and a whole lot of chucking your dignity out the window and unashamedly begging for favours. Friends and family rallied around me to offer locations, props, labour, moral support, and the occasional shoulder to cry on (it\u2019s okay to cry, just don\u2019t do it in front of your cast and crew).\nI had unrealistic expectations for my film \u2014 in exchange for the three years of my life I gave to making it (and another two to writing the screenplay), I wanted it to take me all the way to Hollywood. Spoiler: it didn\u2019t.\nBut here\u2019s what happened. I no longer have a finished screenplay, I have a film. I got a foot in door of the industry, tons of experience, and a feature on my iMDB profile. Being an Australian indie, it didn\u2019t get seen by a whole lot of people, but it did get seen by the right person: a film producer.\nA year after finishing Zelos, I got my first paid screenwriting contract for a feature film. So, in the end, even if it didn\u2019t go to Sundance, it did exactly what I hoped it would do.\nAnd remember, it\u2019s only your first film: it\u2019s a stepping stone to the next thing. Your masterpiece still awaits.\nSo stop pitching your screenplay and just make the damn movie.\nLike my writing?

For them, kicking off a marathon is as simple as reaching out for your device or remote, opening the Netflix app and hitting Play. Simple, fast and instantly gratifying.\nWhat isn\u2019t as simple is what goes into running Netflix, a service that streams around 250 million hours of video per day to around 98 million paying subscribers in 190 countries. At this scale, providing quality entertainment in a matter of a few seconds to every user is no joke. And as much as it means building top-notch infrastructure at a scale no other Internet service has done before, it also means that a lot of participants in the experience have to be negotiated with and kept satiated \u2014 from production companies supplying the content, to internet providers dealing with the network traffic Netflix brings upon them.\nThis is, in short and in the most layman terms, how Netflix works.\nLet us just try to understand how Netflix is structured on the technological side with a simple example.\nLet\u2019s just assume that the Maps app on your phone tracks your location all the time and saves complex information about everywhere you go in a file, locations.txt. And you end up creating an app called LocoList, that, provided there\u2019s a Maps app on your phone, looks for this locations.txt file and shows all the places recorded in that file in a simple list. It works flawlessly.\nNow, let\u2019s just say that developers of the Maps app realise it\u2019s a better idea to store all your location information somewhere else than in that locations.txt file, and updates the app so that it no longer creates or stores that file on your phone. And now LocoList can\u2019t seem to find that locations.txt file it depended on for all its data, and there\u2019s no other way it can extract that information from the Maps app either. LocoList no longer works now. You\u2019re screwed.\nAll your work on LocoList has gone into the trash because a change was made to Maps that broke your app. And while it might not seem a big deal here, on a huge service like Netflix the entire application going down because a change was made to one part of it can not only ruin the experience for users, it also means that all other parts of the application have to be rewritten to accommodate that one tiny change you made to one part of the app. Such a structure is what we call a monolithic architecture.\nNetflix literally ushered in a revolution around ten years ago by rewriting the applications that run the entire service to fit into a microservices architecture \u2014 which means that each application, or microservice\u2019s code and resources are its very own. It will not share any of it with any other app by nature. And when two applications do need to talk to each other, they use an application programming interface (API) \u2014 a tightly-controlled set of rules that both programs can handle. Developers can now make many changes, small or huge, to each application as long as they ensure that it plays well with the API. And since the one program knows the other\u2019s API properly, no change will break the exchange of information.\nNetflix estimates that it uses around 700 microservices to control each of the many parts of what makes up the entire Netflix service: one microservice stores what all shows you watched, one deducts the monthly fee from your credit card, one provides your device with the correct video files that it can play, one takes a look at your watching history and uses algorithms to guess a list of movies that you will like, and one will provide the names and images of these movies to be shown in a list on the main menu. And that\u2019s the tip of the iceberg. Netflix engineers can make changes to any part of the application and can introduce new changes rapidly while ensuring that nothing else in the entire service breaks down.\nTo conclude, why does a microservices architecture matter so much to Netflix? Well, this is what they achieved with just choosing that:\nTo run all of this you need to have a massive network of computer servers, which Netflix once owned on their own, but they realised that the breakneck pace that they grew at \u2014 and needed to continue doing so \u2014 was difficult if they spent their time building computer systems that can support their software and keep fixing and modifying them to fit their needs. They made a courageous decision to get rid of maintaining their own servers and move all of their stuff to the cloud \u2014 i.e. run everything on the servers of someone else who dealt with maintaining the hardware while Netflix engineers wrote hundreds of programs and deployed it on the servers rapidly. The someone else they chose for their cloud-based infrastructure is Amazon Web Services (AWS).\nWait. Amazon? The folks who also happen to run that Prime Video thingy? How can Netflix trust everything they have to an arch-rival?\nWell, a lot of businesses follow a gentleman\u2019s agreement of sorts where they work for each other despite competing in the same categories \u2014 a good example being how Samsung competes with Apple in phones and at the same time the iPhone\u2019s major parts are all manufactured by the Korean giant. Netflix was an AWS customer before Prime Video turned up, but this does not mean they will be hostile towards each other.\nTurns out that Netflix and Amazon\u2019s partnership turned out to be a huge win-win situation for both companies. Netflix turned out to be AWS\u2019s most advanced customers, pushing all of their capabilities to the maximum and constantly innovating upon how they can use the different servers AWS provided for various purposes \u2014 to run microservices, to store movies, to handle internet traffic \u2014 to their own leverage. AWS in turn improved their systems to allow Netflix to take massive loads on their servers, as well as make their use of different AWS products more flexible, and used the expertise gained to serve the needs of thousands of other corporate customers. AWS proudly touts Netflix as it\u2019s top customer, and Netflix can rapidly improve their services and yet keep it stable because of AWS. Even if Netflix takes away Prime Video\u2019s popularity, or vice versa.\nWhat good would be any TV/movie service without, of course, TV shows/movies to watch? For Netflix, getting them from the film producer to the customer is a long and arduous process:\nThe last part about fetching is the one that is most crucial for Netflix here, because after all, that is where the Internet network delivers the video from Netflix\u2019s AWS servers to the customer\u2019s device. If it\u2019s poorly managed or ignored, it means a really slow or unusable Netflix and virtually the end for the company. The internet is the umbilical cord that connects Netflix to its customers, and it takes a lot for them to deliver the content a user wants, in the shortest time possible. On a really crowded network where millions of services compete for space.\nThe entire gamut of operations that build up the Netflix ecosystem \u2014 software, content, and technology \u2014 is rendered useless if the end user\u2019s internet connection is too poor to handle the video quality. Here\u2019s how basically everything on the internet works: when you do something that requires net access, a request is sent to your internet service provider (ISP). The ISP forwards it to the dedicated servers that handle the website, and the servers provide a response which is relayed back to your computer and forms the result. For Netflix and other top-tier sites, where millions of hours of video content is relayed across the internet between their servers and all the users, a much larger network of servers is needed to maintain performance. They do this by building something called a Content Delivery Network (CDN).\nWhat CDNs basically do is, they take the original website and the media content it contains, and copy it across hundreds of servers spread all over the world. So when, say, you log in from Budapest, instead of connecting to the main Netflix server in the United States it will load a ditto copy of it from a CDN server that is the closest to Budapest. This greatly reduces the latency \u2014 the time taken between a request and a response, and everything loads really fast. CDNs are the reason why websites with a huge number of users like Google, Facebook, or YouTube manage to load really fast irrespective of where you are or what the Internet speed is like.\nNetflix earlier used a variety of CDN networks \u2014 operated by giants such as Akamai, Level 3 and Limelight Networks to deliver their content. But a growing user base means they must deliver higher number of content at more locations while lowering costs \u2014 and this led them to build their own CDN, called Open Connect.\nHere, instead of relying on AWS servers, they install their very own around the world. But it has only one purpose \u2014 to store content smartly and deliver it to users. Netflix strikes deals with internet service providers and provides them the red box you saw above at no cost. ISPs install these along with their servers. These Open Connect boxes download the Netflix library for their region from the main servers in the US \u2014 if there are multiple of them, each will rather store content that is more popular with Netflix users in a region to prioritise speed. So a rarely watched film might take time to load more than a Stranger Things episode. Now, when you will connect to Netflix, the closest Open Connect box to you will deliver the content you need, thus videos load faster than if your Netflix app tried to load it from the main servers in the US.\nThink of it as hard drives around the world storing videos, and the closer they are, the faster you can get to them and load up the video. There is a lot more trickery that goes on behind the scenes: as this interview explains, whenever you hit play on a show, Netflix will locate the 10 closest Open Connect boxes that have the show loaded on them. Your Netflix app/site will then try to detect which one of them is the closest or works fastest on your internet connection, and then load video from there. This is why videos start out blurry but then suddenly sharpen up \u2014 that is Netflix switching servers till it connects to the one that will give you the highest quality of video.\nThis is what happens when you hit that Play button:\nIt looked so simple before, right?\n[Update (November 21, 2017): An image on this article was mistakenly attributed to be that of an Amazon Web Services data center.

As an act of kick starting the suit, this month\u2019s article is titled \u201c15 Movies you should watch if you are an Aspiring Screenwriter\u201d. This exclusive list encompasses 15 movies of different languages (except Tamil) which are appreciated for their screenplay. The list has no Tamil movies since we have planned to post a separate article for Tamil movies under the same title! Moreover, these movies are meant not just for aspiring screenwriters, we honestly believe every movie buff will genuinely enjoy these movies.\nThe movies are ranked in no particular order and they made to the list based on different perspectives which have been mentioned in the article. If you feel a potential movie is not mentioned, we genuinely apologize, and we request you to mention the name of the movie in the comments! Finally, we don\u2019t mean these movies are the best ones, instead we are just providing you a list from which we hope you will learn something about screenwriting!\nFor: Genre satisfaction, neo-modernism\nThe 70s and 80s witnessed a huge drop in the number of Western and noir films made due to the entry of modern and postmodern thoughts. But as wise men would say \u201cTime always repeats itself\u201d, these concepts have now been reaffirmed according to modern concepts of writing, thereby giving birth to neo-modern, neo-western, and neo-noir styles of filmmaking. These genres of movies are the best resources for understanding how we have evolved as artists. Wind river is one of the most stunning movies made in recent times. The quality of the content is top notch and the depiction of human lives in this neo-western genre is satisfying for an old cinema fan too. One thing seems certain from the revival of western genre: \u201cWe may reach new heights in technology, but human nature and behaviors never change.\u201d\n2. 12 Angry Men (1957)\nFor: Realism in the interaction between Characters\nDo you believe a single room and a dozen characters are enough for creating a 2.5 hours movie? You may say yes, in fact recently filmmakers are coming up with tons of creative ideas to make these kinds of movies. But in 1957, it was extremely difficult to pull the crowd for such movies. 12 Angry Men is a must watch if you are an aspiring filmmaker. Every aspect in the movie such as the camera movement and the knife sharpened dialogues will make you paranoid about conventional cinema. It sometimes makes me wonder, how such levels of realism worked in 1957, and how a director actually had the guts to execute such script.\n3. The Godfather: Part II (1974)\nFor: Storyline manipulation and Sequence Development\nThe Godfather trilogy is an adaptation of the novel under the same title by Author Mario Puzo. The first part of the movie became a huge success and is considered even now as the pioneer of all gangster movies. Naturally, all eyes were focused on The Godfather II during its release. The second part is focused on two timelines: The Son\u2019s rising and The Father\u2019s history of rising. Both the timelines explain their characters\u2019 pursuit of attaining power and becoming the supreme. The intercuts between the timelines create a unique style in the way in the portrayal of the similarities in the situations faced by the characters. And because of this storytelling approach, the last scene of Vito\u2019s birthday celebration becomes epic. Credits must be given to the screenplay writer as the writing perfectly blends with the realities in the timelines. This is one of the very few movies where the sequel turned out better than the original.\n4. Inglourious Basterds (2009)\nFor: Conversation building\nThe opening scene of Inglourious Basterds gives the audience a clear-cut idea about the movie. This, a little over 20 min scene is entirely built up on a conversation between two characters. Most viewers would consider such scenes to be boring since the normal audience expect the opening sequence to be fast paced or action packed. Not only this scene, the entire movie can be dissected into 6 or 7 scenes. Despite this lack in the number of scenes, elements such as Suspense, Irony and Drama all are incorporated well into the script thereby delivering spicy content for the viewers. Though the movie is slow paced, it sure teaches an aspiring writer a few things on writing.\n5. The Social Network (2010)\nFor: Social psychiatric and post-modern touch\nAs some of you might already know, the Social Network is the biography of Mark Zuckerberg. Though the notion about Biographies is that they are boring, directors like David Fincher know how to insert cinematic elements in the plot while retaining the soul of the story. The movie in no way looked like a biography or a documentary. It is an incredible gem and a psychological grunge made as dark as possible. The realistic dialogues between characters, portrayal of envy, lies and similar tiny emotions build the screenplay beautifully. With his own non-linear style, Fincher ensured this movie stays a modern classic.\n6. New World (2013)\nFor: Cinematic style\nIn the case of movies, though the script is much important, its portrayal should not be like a novel or stage play. That is why we call the writing \u201cscreenplay\u201d. The screenwriting should contain its own style reminding that it is indeed a movie the viewers are watching. Korean movies hugely lack the formal writing but instead they focus on realism and the above-mentioned cinematic style of writing. Though New World is not a thriller, it is a great source for understanding the elements of slow pacing in writing. If you are an aspiring slow-paced screen writer, this movie is a jackpot for you. The writer succeeds in making the audience very casually light up a cigarette after watching!\n7. Memento (2000)\nFor: Meaningful complexity and film noir elements\nThese days, many writers are obsessed with non-linear storytelling, and there is nothing wrong with it. But the question the screenwriters must be asking themselves is \u201cDoes the plot require it?\u201d. In the case of Memento, if I ask the above question, the answer would be, since the protagonist has a short-term memory loss and he can\u2019t remember what happened before 10 minutes, non-linear storytelling does more justice to the plot than conventional storytelling. Thus, the director wants us to empathize with the protagonist while watching the movie, as we won\u2019t be knowing what happened in the previous incident just like the protagonist. So, \u201cMeaning in complexity \u201c works very well here. To be honest, even Christopher Nolan\u2019s The Prestige didn\u2019t satisfy this aspect. This teaches us not to make non-linearity just for style.\n8. Andhadhun(2018)\nFor: Dramatic Irony\nIn terms of writing, Irony can be defined as, \u201cDelivering an outcome that is contrary to what was, or might have been, expected by the Audience or the characters\u201d. Not much can be understood from the definition of this term, it just has to be experienced and felt. In Andhadhun, we can specifically notice such great scenes entirely built up on irony. The scene where the policeman hides in the restroom, the protagonist\u2019s arrival at the police station and the audience\u2019s knowledge on his blindness while the characters are puzzled over it are a few examples of dramatic irony from the movie which makes it more than just a thriller.\n9. A Separation (2011)\nFor: Partial detailing\nSome movies deeply concentrate on the details of the story or certain sequences. Is it always needed? A Separation is a brilliant attempt to break this convention. There is an important moment in the movie that is key to the plot, but it has very less information, and some of the details are splattered by the dialogues. This partial detailing works for many scenes in the movie, since we as the audience are left to assume certain details throughout the course of the movie. Asghar Farhadi\u2019s screenplay is the forerunner to this not so explored way of storytelling.\n10. Amores Perros (2000)\nFor: Justified hyperlinking\nThere are a lot of movies based on hyperlink concepts, where three or four parallel storylines meet at one point. In many such movies, the theme of the storylines is not justified, and the purpose of hyperlinking seem to be simply the sake of hyperlinking. Contrastingly, in this movie, a horrific car accident connects three stories that involves characters dealing with lots of flaws in the name of love. After the accident occurs, the story focuses on how the characters\u2019 arc change. The theme of the movie is \u201cHow love can hurt people\u201d. Through this movie, the writer shows how to flip the fate of the characters in one moment and this movie is a very good reference for writers who wish to write meaningful hyperlinks.\n11. Thondimuthalum Dhriksakshiyum (2017)\nFor: Realism in Characters and scenes\nMost of the movies these days fail in bridging the gap between the real world and the world it portrays. When simple storylines are increasingly portrayed in such fanciful worlds, the filmmaker has taken in hand a simple plot and has pulled it off entirely in a completely realistic world. For instance, you might think of the character Sudhakar as a minor character. But everything from the costume to the dialogues for that character were deeply chiseled. If that hadn\u2019t been done, it would have not been possible to create the realistic world the plot sails in. This movie reiterates the fact that you don\u2019t actually need to write a character and the details very deeply, instead if the character is closer to the real world, the details of the character will turn out awesome. There are many iconic scenes in the movie which deeply connect with the real world. \u201cWhen movies are closer to life, they are remembered\u201d. This movie should be watched by everyone who loves cinema.\n12. Oldboy (2003)\nFor: Dark humor, Absurdity, and Surrealism\nOldboy is arguably one of the best postmodern cinemas ever made. The plot of this movie is a serious taboo topic. The establishment of the characters and scenes in the movie are strange and absurd. Black comedy writers should watch this movie at any cost and must analyze its script. Dialogues are a great influence for the postmodern writers and the dialogues in this movie are sharp and precise. The film looks vintage made and the depiction of scenes are super realistic and in its unique way.\n13. Gangs of Wasseypur (2012)\nFor: Black Comedy, self-referentiality and cultural-referentiality\nThe movie portrays the violence happening at a place for over 3 generations in 2 parts. The depiction of violence in the writing is magnificent. In fact, aspiring writers can learn many aspects of world-building from this movie. The movie strongly focuses on the reference of its own content in the film. This movie is a great source of information for those who love realism in violence.\n14. John Wick (2014)\nFor: World building\nRealistic characters are built for the real world. But some stories need to step away from the world and it must narrate some fantasy. In that case, how would you determine the behavior of the world you create and justify the characters? John Wick is an excellent suggestion to find the answer to this question. As a writer, if you manage to find the answers to this question, you would have become capable of creating your own world for your story. How did the director manage to make us believe that John avenged for his dog\u2019s murderers? The answer is dumped in the script and task of finding it lies in your hands. Also, the character formation is brilliant in this created world.\n15. Waltz with Bashir (2008)\nFor: Documentary style\nWaltz with Bashir is a documentary about the Lebanon war. It is a visually stunning animated movie which never compromises its cinematic effects just for the sake of it being a documentary. The symbolism and magical realism in the writing are perfect. This movie\u2019s ending will stay for a long time in your memory. As a writer, this movie is the collective resource for philosophical elements in your story.\n-Written by Amuthan, Third year, EIE.\n", "claps": "31 claps", "author": "Student Journalist Council of GCT", "comments": [], "link": "https://medium.com/@sjcgct/15-movies-you-should-watch-if-you-are-an-aspiring-screenwriter-or-a-movie-buff-d754893a6494"}, {"title": "[REVIEW] Avengers: Endgame Spends Too Much Time at the Gyno", "num_comments": "unspecified", "tags": [], "reading_time": 4, "text": "Legally, I\u2019m not supposed to post this review.

As such, it makes sense to also try and use the world surrounding us as a tool to describe our craft.\nIn this case, we take a page from architecture (the one with buildings and bridges) and the seminal architecture book called A Pattern Language: Towns, Buildings, Construction by Christopher Alexander, Sara Ishikawa, Murray Silverstein where patterns are described as follows:\nIn software development, architecture is the process of constructing an application in a healthy, robust and maintainable way and patterns provide a way of giving names to solutions for common problems. These solutions can range from abstract/conceptual to very precise and technical and allow developers to effectively communicate with each other.\nIf two or more developers on a team are knowledgeable about patterns, talking about solutions to problems becomes very efficient. If only one developer knows about patterns, explaining them to the rest of the team is usually easy.\nThe goal of this article is to whet your appetite for a somewhat formal representation of knowledge in software development by introducing you to the idea of software design patterns and presenting a couple of patterns which are interesting because they get used considerably in modern JavaScript projects.\nThe singleton pattern isn\u2019t one of the most widely used ones, but we\u2019re starting here because it\u2019s relatively easy to grasp.\nThe singleton pattern stems from the mathematical concept of a singleton which is:\nIn software, it simply means that we limit the instantiation of a class to a single object. The first time an object of a class implementing the singleton pattern should be instantiated, it is actually going to get instantiated. Any subsequent try is just going to return that first instance.\nApart from allowing us to only have one superhero ever (which would obviously be Batman), why would we ever use the singleton pattern?\nAlthough the singleton pattern isn\u2019t without its problems (it\u2019s been called evil before with singletons being called pathological liars), it still has its uses. The most notable one would be for instantiating configuration objects. You probably only want one configuration instance for your application, unless a feature of your application is providing multiple configurations.\nAngular\u2019s services are a prime example of the singleton pattern being used in a big popular framework. There is a dedicated page in Angular\u2019s documentation explaining how to make sure that a service is always provided as a singleton.\nServices being singletons makes a lot of sense, since services are used as a place to store state, configuration and allow communication between components and you want to make sure that there aren\u2019t multiple instances messing up these concepts.\nAs an example, let\u2019s say that you have a trivial application which is used for counting how many times buttons have been clicked.\nYou should keep track of the number of button presses in one object which provides:\nIf that object wasn\u2019t a singleton (and the buttons would each get their own instance) the click count wouldn\u2019t be correct. Also, which of the counting instances would you provide to the component showing the current count?\nThe observer pattern is defined as follows:\nIt\u2019s really easy to understand the observer pattern if we try comparing it to an example in the real world \u2014 newspaper subscriptions.\nThe usual scenario when buying a newspaper is that you walk to the newsstand and ask if the new issue of your favourite newspaper is out. If it isn\u2019t, it\u2019s a sad affair of inefficiency where you have to walk home and try again later. In JavaScript terms, this would be the same as looping until you get the desired result.When you finally get your hands on the newspaper, you can do what you meant to do the whole time \u2014 sit down with a cup of coffee and enjoy your newspaper (or, in JavaScript terms, execute the callback function that you wanted to do the whole time).\nThe smart thing to do (and get your beloved newspaper each day) would be to subscribe to the newspaper.That way, the publishing company would let you know when a new issue of the newspaper is out and deliver it to you. No more running to the newsstand. No more disappointment. Bliss.In JavaScript terms, you wouldn\u2019t be looping and asking for the result until you run a function any more. You would, instead, let a subject know that you are interested in events (messages) and would provide a callback function which should be called when new data is ready. You are, then, the observer.\nThe nice thing is \u2014 you don\u2019t have to be the only subscriber. As you would be disappointed by missing your newspaper, so would other people, too. That\u2019s why multiple observers can subscribe to the subject.\nThe observer pattern has many use cases but generally, it should be used when you want to create a one-to-many dependency between objects which isn\u2019t tightly coupled and have the possibility to let an open-ended number of objects know when a state has changed.\nJavaScript is a great place for the observable pattern because everything is event-driven and, rather than always asking if an event happened, you should let the event inform you (like the old adage \u201cDon\u2019t call us we\u2019ll call you\u201d). Chances are you already did something which looks like the observer pattern \u2014 addEventListener. Adding an event listener to an element has all the markings of the observer pattern:\nThe big payoff from learning about the observer pattern is that you can implement your own subject or grasp an already existing solution much faster.\nImplementing a basic observable shouldn\u2019t be too hard, but there is a great library being used by many projects and that\u2019s ReactiveX of which RxJS is its JavaScript counterpart.\nRxJS allows you not only to subscribe to subjects, but also gives you the possibility of transforming the data in any way you can imagine, combining multiple subscriptions, making asynchronous work more manageable and much much more. If you ever wanted to bring your data processing and transformation level to a higher level, RxJS would be a great library to learn.\nApart from the observer pattern, ReactiveX also prides itself with implementing the iterator pattern which gives subjects the possibility of letting its subscribers know when a subscription ended, effectively ending the subscription from the subject\u2019s side. I am not going to be explaining the iterator pattern in this article, but it would be a great exercise for you to learn more about it and see how it fits in with the observable pattern.\nThe facade pattern is a pattern which takes its name from architecture. In architecture:\nAs the facade in architecture is an exterior of the building, hiding its inner workings, the facade pattern in software development tries to hide the underlying complexity behind a front, effectively allowing you to work with an API which is easier to grasp while providing the possibility to change the underlying code however you want.\nYou can use the facade pattern in a myriad of situations but the most notable ones would be to make your code easier to understand (hide complexity) and to make dependencies as loosely coupled as possible.\nIt is easy to see why a facade object (or layer with multiple objects) would be a great thing. You don\u2019t want to be dealing with dragons if it can be avoided. The facade object is going to provide you a nice API and deal with all the dragon shenanigans itself.\nAnother great thing that we can do here is change out the dragon from the background without ever touching the rest of the application. Let\u2019s say that you want to change that dragon out with a kitten. It still has claws, but is much easier kept fed. Changing it out is a matter of rewriting the code in the facade without changing any of the dependent objects.\nA place where you will see facades often is Angular using its services as a means of simplifying background logic. But it doesn\u2019t have to only be Angular, as you will see in the next example.\nLet\u2019s say that you want to add state management to your application. You could take Redux, NgRx, Akita, MobX, Apollo or any of the new kids on the block that have been popping up left and right. Well, why not choose them all and take them for a spin?\nWhat are the basic functionalities a state management library is going to provide you?\nProbably:\nThat doesn\u2019t sound too bad.\nNow, with the power of the facade pattern under your belt, you can write facades for each part of the state which are going to provide a nice API for you to work with \u2014 something like facade.startSpinner(), facade.stopSpinner() and facade.getSpinnerState(). These methods are really easy to understand and reason about.\nAfter that, you can tackle the facade and write the code which is going to transform your code so that it works with Apollo (managing state with GraphQL \u2014 so hot right now). You may notice that it doesn\u2019t suit your coding style at all or that the way unit tests have to be written really isn\u2019t your cup of tea. No problem, write a new facade which is going to support MobX.\nYou\u2019ve probably noticed that there was no code or implementation of the design patterns I\u2019ve talked about. That\u2019s because each of these design patterns could be at least a chapter in a book for itself.\nNow that we\u2019re talking about books, it wouldn\u2019t hurt to take a look at one or two dealing with design patterns in depth.\nThe first and biggest recommendation has to be Design Patterns: Elements of Reusable Object-Oriented Software by Erich Gamma, Richard Helm, Ralph Johnson, and John Vlisside also known as the Gang of Four. The book is a gold mine and the de facto bible of software design patterns.\nIf you are looking for something that\u2019s a bit easier to digest, there is Head First Design Patterns by Bert Bates, Kathy Sierra, Eric Freeman and Elisabeth Robson. It\u2019s a very nice book which tries to convey the message of design patterns through a visual perspective.\nLast but not least, nothing beats just Googling, reading and trying out different approaches. Even if you end up never using a pattern or technique, you\u2019ll learn something and grow in ways you never expected.\nThe speech bubbles used in the illustrations are created by starline \u2014 www.freepik.com.\n", "claps": "4.3K claps", "author": "Kristian Poslek", "comments": ["I liked last words \u201c nothing beats just Googling, reading and trying out different approaches.\u201d Really Impressive.RegardsSharon Martin", "Thank you for sharing!", "Thanks for writing this.

As I found React hooks so promising, I have been developing a hooks-based library for React Redux called \u201creactive-react-redux.\u201d\nCoding style using this library is mentally different from the official react-redux. Thanks to Proxy, developers don\u2019t need to care about optimization, but just focus on composition of logic.\nThis library provides two basic hooks: useReduxState and useReduxDispatch. This article shows example code how to use them.\nWe use a tiny example in this article. The following is how our Redux store state looks like.\nWe can create a custom hook based on useReduxState. Let\u2019s create a hook that receives an item index and returns an item object.\nNow, we use this hook to create a component.\nThis style is totally different from the one with connect, which would look like the following.\nSuppose our component only uses title and no description, our component would be something like this.\nBecause useReduxState tracks the usage of state in render, it won\u2019t trigger re-render if only description is changed. We don\u2019t need to create \u201cuseItemWithTitle\u201d and \u201cuseItemWithTitleAndDescription\u201d hooks, but just one \u201cuseItem\u201d does the job.\nThis is an important aspect of the hook. We can even create \u201cuseItemTitle.\u201d\nNote that the examples above can be over-simplified and they don\u2019t seem very useful, but hopefully they explain the idea.\nThere can be various patterns for useReduxDispatch.\nProbably the simplest is to create a hook to dispatch a specific action.\nIf you already have an action creator, you can create a general hook.\nYou could also pass action creators, if you prefer.\nWhen I started writing this article, I was hoping to come up with better example code so that readers get aha. Reading the entire article again, I\u2019m not very confident if this is appealing as expected. I decided to let go anyway, and will see.

Below is a list of 21 books that will help lead you to a better, stronger 2018.\nDeep Work: Rules for Focused Success in a Distracted World by Cal Newport Media consumption went way up in 2017. For most of us, that meant happiness and productivity went way down. The world is becoming noisier and will become more so every day. If you can\u2019t cultivate the ability to have quiet, insightful, deeply focused periods of productive work, you\u2019re going to get screwed. This is a book that explains how to cultivate and protect that skill \u2014 the ability to do deep work. I strongly urge you to begin this practice in 2018\u2014 if you want to get anything done or perform your best.\nThe Subtle Art of Not Giving a F*ck: A Counterintuitive Approach to Living a Good Life by Mark Manson To me, practical philosophy has always been the art knowing what to \u2014 and what not to \u2014 give a fuck about. That\u2019s what Mark\u2019s book is about. It\u2019s not about apathy. It\u2019s about cultivating indifference to things that don\u2019t matter. Be careful, as Marcus Aurelius warns, not to give the little things more time and thought they deserved. Maybe looking back at this year reveals how much effort you\u2019ve frittered away worrying about the trivial. If so, let 2018 be a year that you only devote energy to things that truly matter \u2014 get the important things right by ignoring the insignificant.\nThe Way to Love: The Last Meditations of Anthony de Mello by Anthony de Mello Coach Shaka Smart recommended this little book (and it\u2019s a little book, probably the smallest I\u2019ve ever read. It fits in your palm). But it\u2019s an incredibly wise and helpful read. Written by a Catholic Priest who\u2019d lived in India, the book has this unusual convergence of eastern and western thought. One of my favorite lines: \u201cThe question to ask is not \u2018What\u2019s wrong with this person?\u2019 but \u2018What does this irritation tell me about myself?\u2019 I plan on regularly revisiting it throughout 2018.\nBut What If We\u2019re Wrong by Chuck Klosterman It\u2019s always good to remind ourselves that almost everything we\u2019re certain about will probably be eventually proven wrong. Klosterman\u2019s subtitle \u2014 Thinking About the Present As If It Were the Past \u2014 is a brilliant exercise for getting some perspective in 2018. Whether you think it\u2019s going to be a year of radical change for the better or a horrible year of excesses of dangerous precedent, you\u2019re probably wrong. You\u2019re probably not even in the ballpark. This book shows you why, not with lectures about politics, but with a bunch of awesome thought experiments about music, books, movies and science.\nRules for Radicals: A Practical Primer for Realistic Radicals by Saul Alinsky If Hillary Clinton had remembered the lessons of Saul Alinsky (who she wrote her college thesis on), the election may have turned out differently. Why? A notorious strategist and community organizer, Alinsky was a die hard pragmatist, but he also knew how to tell a story and create a collective cause. He could work within the system but knew how to shake it up and generate attention. This book is a classic and woefully underrated. Whatever you set out to do in 2018, this book can provide you with strategic guidance and insight.\nThe Filter Bubble by Eli Pariser / Trust Me I\u2019m Lying by Ryan Holiday / The Brass Check by Upton Sinclair I strongly recommend that you take the time in 2018 to read these books. In light of this year, you owe it to yourself to study and better understand how our media system works. In The Filter Bubble, Eli Pariser warns of the danger of living in bubbles of personalization that reinforce and insulate our worldview. Though Sinclair\u2019s The Brass Check has been almost entirely forgotten by history, it\u2019s not only fascinating but a timeless perspective. Sinclair deeply understood the economic incentives of early 20th century journalism and thus could predict and analyze the manipulative effect it had on The Truth. I used that book as a model for my expose of the media system, Trust Me, I\u2019m Lying. Today, the incentives and pressures are different but they warp our information in a similar way. In almost every substantial charge Upton leveled against the yellow press, you could, today, sub in blogs and the cable news cycle and be even more correct.\n48 Laws of Power / 33 Strategies of War by Robert Greene Robert Greene is a master of human psychology and human dynamics \u2014 he has a profound ability to explain timeless truths through story and example. You can read the classics and not always understand the lessons. But if you read Robert\u2019s books, I promise you will leave not just with actionable lessons but an indelible sense of what to do in many trying and confusing situations. I wrote earlier this year that strategic wisdom is not something we are born with \u2014 but the lessons are there for us to pick up. Pick these two up before the year ends and operate the next with a strategic mindset and clarity.\nConspiracy: Peter Thiel, Hulk Hogan, Gawker, and the Anatomy of Intrigue by Ryan Holiday \u2014 If you want to immerse yourself in the above topics of media and strategy, and are looking for one book to teach you lessons in both, my book on the nearly decade-long conspiracy that billionaire Peter Thiel waged against Gawker will do this for you. This is a stunning story about how power works in the modern age, and is a masterclass in strategy and how to accomplish wildly ambitious aims.\nThe Road To Character by David Brooks When General Stanley McChrystal was asked on the Tim Ferriss podcastwhat was a recent purchase that had most positively impacted his life, he pointed to this book. I agree. It can be a bit stilted and dense at times, but it should be assigned reading to any young person today (a little challenge is a good thing). Illustrating with examples and stories from great men and women, Brooks admonishes the reader to undertake their own journey of character perfection. In my own book, I explore the same topic (humility) from a different angle using similar stories \u2014 I\u2019m attacking ego, he\u2019s building up character. Both will be important for the next year.\nThe Dip by Seth Godin This book is a short 70 pages and it looks like something someone would give as a joke gift, but it\u2019s anything but. Godin talks frankly about quitting and pushing through \u2014 and when to do each. Quit when you\u2019ll be mediocre, when the returns aren\u2019t worth the investment, when you no longer think you\u2019ll enjoy the ends. Stick when the dip is the obstacle that creates scarcity, when you\u2019re simply bridging the gap between beginner\u2019s luck and mastery. I promise, next year you are guaranteed to find yourself in moments when you don\u2019t know what is the right answer. This book will help you find it.\nHillbilly Elegy: A Memoir of a Family and Culture in Crisis by J. D. Vance / Strangers in Their Own Land: Anger and Mourning on the American Right by Arlie Russell Hochschild You might describe Hillbilly Elegy as a Ta-Nehisi Coates style memoir about a community that \u2014 at least in progressive circles \u2014 gets a lot less attention: disaffected, impoverished whites (particularly in the mid-east and South). I thought the book was empathetic, self-aware and inspiring. The author pokes some holes in the concept of \u201cwhite privilege\u201d \u2014 certainly a third or fourth generation hillbilly in Kentucky doesn\u2019t walk around feeling like they have it easy \u2014 and an explanation of some of the phenomenon behind Donald Trump (notice I said explanation, not an excuse). This is a sober but also hopeful book. I urge people on all sides of the political spectrum to read it, but progressives would benefit from the eye-opening perspective the most. Pair it with Strangers in Their Own Land, the author of which, a Berkeley native, visits and interviews people in the deep Louisiana countryside. (Remember: you don\u2019t have to agree with the people you\u2019re reading about \u2014 but you should care what makes them tick.)\nIt Can\u2019t Happen Here by Sinclair Lewis This book is one that will make you so uncomfortable that you\u2019ll probably pick it up and put it down several times. It almost shocks you that this exists, that it\u2019s not some work of fiction pretending to be 80 years old. But no, in fact, one of America\u2019s most famous writers wrote a bestselling book about an appalling populist demagogue who won the presidency of the United States. Europe was a mess, the economy was in the toilet. Well meaning people talked earnestly about the need for \u201cserious change\u201d and \u201crevolution.\u201d The parties split, and a fringe candidate suddenly becomes viable. When people tried to question some of the ideas he campaigned on, they were shouted down: \u201cThis is how all politicians speak. He\u2019s not serious about that extreme stuff.\u201d Life imitates art and now, this is what actually happened. Change the dates, places and names and it\u2019s no longer fiction, it\u2019s real. Fiction is best when it puts a mirror up to us. This book does that. If you don\u2019t read the book, at least please read about it. Because you need to know. It can happen here.\nHow to Live: Or A Life of Montaigne in One Question and Twenty Attempts at an Answer by Sarah Bakewell The book is spectacular. It was a bestseller in the UK and was featured in a 6 part series in The Guardian. The format of the book is a bit unusual, instead of chapters it is made up of 20 Montaigne style essays that discuss the man from a variety of different perspectives. Montaigne was a man obsessed with figuring himself out \u2014 why he thought the way he did, how he could find happiness, his fetishes, his near-death experiences. He lived in tumultuous times too and he coped by looking inward. We\u2019re lucky he did, and we can do the same.\nTribe: On Homecoming and Belonging by Sebastian Junger Junger looks at many of the social issues we have today: PTSD. Depression. Political polarization. Contempt for our fellow citizens. Aimlessness. We\u2019ve lost the bonds that tie a tribe and culture together. No wonder veterans feel alone and lost when they leave their tight knit tribe and re-enter solitary civilian life. No wonder manypeople feel that way regardless of whether they served or not. No wonder we have trouble agreeing on basic solutions to common problems. There is no sense of what is common or basic or shared. Given the divisiveness that we are facing as a society \u2014 that became painfully clear in 2016 \u2014 this is one of the most urgent and important book you need to read next year.\nThe Years of Lyndon Johnson (4 Volumes) by Robert A. Caro In January of 2016, I picked up my first book in this Caro\u2019s series on Lyndon Johnson. It wasn\u2019t until June that I finished my fourth, but I consider finishing all (~3,500 pages) of them to be one of my proudest reading achievements. If there is one line that sums up the whole series it\u2019s this: It\u2019s that power doesn\u2019t only corrupt. That\u2019s too simple. What power does is reveal. It\u2019s also easy to be disillusioned by politics right now but for me, getting lost in these Lyndon Johnson books has been a helpful and educational process. Because you learn two things 1) that things have always been complicated and confusing but they tend to turn out alright 2) that our system, whatever its flaws, can still produce good results from bad men. And without a doubt, that\u2019s a good reminder to have on the eve of 2018.\nThe Last Lion: Winston Spencer Churchill (3 Volumes) by William Manchester Don\u2019t think an individual can make a difference in history? Then you haven\u2019t read enough about Winston Churchill. The scenes in this book: warning about the looming threat of Nazism, the retreat at Dunkirk, persevering through the Blitz, vowing to fight on the landing grounds and the beaches and in the streets, whatever the cost may be. The sheer determination of this man, to take an entire country on your back and defy a horde which had overrun the European continent in a matter of months...it\u2019s almost breathtaking to think about. (If you were to only read one thing in the next year, you could do a lot worse than either of these series. They contain dozens of books within them and will teach you about so much more than just the man they are ostensibly about. Please, please read them.)\nMr. Eternity by Aaron Thier / The Count of Monte Cristo by Alexandre Dumas These books really have nothing to do with the events of 2016 but they are long and entertaining and they will make you forget your problems for the next 12 months. I thought I\u2019d read Monte Cristo as a kid, but clearly I didn\u2019t. Because the actual book is a 1,200 page epic of some of the most brilliant, beautiful and complicated storytelling ever put to paper. What a book! When I typed out my notes (and quotes) after finishing this book, it ran some 3,000 words. As for Mr. Eternity, it\u2019s a fun, epic jaunt through the distant future (as though it was the past) in the vein of Voltaire\u2019s Candide. Candide isn\u2019t a bad read for this year either: \u201cWe must cultivate our own garden.\u201d\nI\u2019ve created a list of 15 books you\u2019ve never heard of that will alter your worldview and help you excel at your career.\nGet the secret book list here!\nThis originally appeared on Thought Catalog.\n", "claps": "48K claps", "author": "Ryan Holiday", "comments": [], "link": "https://medium.com/the-mission/if-you-only-read-a-few-books-in-2018-read-these-89d03fc149c6"}, {"title": "Want to Read More Books Without Losing Comprehension?

But rapid reading is not a difficult skill to learn, says Peter Kump, author of Breakthrough Rapid Reading.\nReading can transform your health, wealth, and productivity.\nComprehension has always been more important than just reading.\nWithout comprehension, reading is a wasted effort.\nYou read because you want to learn something new, improve a specific skill or enjoy a great narrative or novel.\nComprehension is the core of reading any material. It\u2019s also the reason many people spend a lot of time on a single book.\nThe one habit that may be hindering your progress when you choose to read is regression. But you can eliminate your reading inefficiencies and increase your reading speed while improving retention.\nOne of the biggest obstacles to speed reading is regression.\nIt\u2019s the habit of re-reading something you have already read in order to be sure you really understood the message you read.\nWhen regression is compulsive, the habit can be harder to break.\n\u201cWhen you regress like this, you lose the flow and structure of the text, and your overall understanding of the subject can decrease. Be very conscious of regression, and don\u2019t allow yourself to re-read material unless you absolutely have to\u201d, says April Troester, PhD.\nLack of confidence in your reading skills can cause regression.\nIf you don\u2019t trust yourself to have fully understood what you\u2019ve just read, you will regress all the time.\nFor many readers, this can happen over and over and over again.\nInstead of improving their reading habits, many people use this habit to refocus when they feel they are being distracted.\nIn as much as you think regression is helping you, it actually slows you down more than you think.\nRegression probably wastes about a third of every hour you spend reading.\nIt\u2019s like taking two steps forward with your eyes and one step back, and for many people, a lot more than one step back.\nSometimes \u2014 but not very often \u2014 regression necessary, especially if you are reading about a technical subject and want to understand better.\nOr when the author is not engaging better and you have to figure out the message yourself.\nBut more often than not, people regress because it\u2019s a habit they\u2019ve developed over time.\nIf you are aiming to read faster and get the most important ideas in any book you pick up, you have to quit the habit of going back to chapters you\u2019ve already read.\nInstead of revisiting pages, what you could do is to focus better, remove distractions and aim to read a particular number of pages every time you start reading again.\nImprove your concentration habit, and you won\u2019t have to regress so many times before you actually finish that book.\nWhen your brain develops the habit of re-reading at any time, it relaxes and does not concentrate properly because it knows it will go back at some point.\nIt stops you from immersing yourself deeply in any book.\nWhen that happens, you won\u2019t fully grasp all the ideas in the book.\nThe simplest approach to stop re-reading over and over again is to choose books or topics you deeply care about.\n\u201cReading a book should be an experience that provides you joy and value, not something to labor through,\u201d says Patrick Allen of Lifehacker.\nIf reading takes more effort and it\u2019s a struggle, you\u2019re going to want to do less of it.\nBefore you even start reading any book, ask yourself if you are curious enough about the topic to give it your full attention or concentration.\nPassive readers hardly finish any book because they are not curious enough.\nThey read because they have time to spend instead of investing in a topic.\nGet curious before you even start reading.\nWhat do you look for in any book you choose? Let that be your guide and you will focus better when you read.\nSchedule you reading and stick to your allocated time.\nExample, you can set aside half an hour of your time to read your favourite book without distraction.\nStart by eliminating all the distractions that may prevent you from reading (social media, email notifications, news notifications, background music, etc.).\nYou could disable all notifications on your phone.\nYou will be more focused when it\u2019s only you and book you are reading.\nAim to concentrate the whole half an hour.\nDon\u2019t hurry the process.\nJust enjoy the book and the ideas the author is conveying during that time.\nTo retain the information better, you can take notes after every reading sprint.\nUse the 50/50 principle to retain better and remember the core ideas of any book. You won\u2019t have to regress if you are not distracted.\nTo reduce the number of times you backtrack, Troester recommends you run a pointer (a finger, a pen, or the cursor) along the line as you read.\n\u201cYour eyes will follow the tip of your pointer, helping you avoid skipping back. The speed at which you read using this method will largely depend on the speed at which you move the pointer,\u201d she says.\nIt's important to note that you don\u2019t have to finish every book to fully embrace better reading habits.\nI tend to have at least 5 books in my \u201cactive\u201d pile of books I\u2019m currently reading, but I try not to regress to make real progress as I focus on comprehending the ideas in each book.\nRegression seriously slows your reading speed.\nThe good news is, you can easily replace it with a better habit, but it takes concentration and practice.\nStart slow and aim to make progress instead of trying to change the habit as soon as possible, especially if your brain is already used to re-reading all the time.\nQuitting regression can increase your reading speed and help you read more books every months or year.\nAs you invest more time reading, it will get easier and you know what habits are helping you read more books.\n", "claps": "3.3K claps", "author": "Thomas Oppong", "comments": [], "link": "https://medium.com/personal-growth/want-to-read-more-books-without-losing-comprehension-learn-to-resist-regression-d1e3fe0c625a"}, {"title": "Writer Life: Day Sixty \u2013 The Every Day Novelist \u2013 Medium", "num_comments": "unspecified", "tags": ["productivity", "creativity", "writing", "reading", "books"], "reading_time": 3, "text": "Sixty days.

We went through each carton, page by page. And that was just the beginning. Outside of what was in that collection, there were other published and unpublished volumes of Shannon\u2019s work, totaling in the thousands of pages; never-before-seen interviews given to us by his family and others; letters and memos from countless collaborators and friends. We pored over several decades\u2019 worth of the Otsego County Times, Shannon\u2019s hometown paper, and a similar set of records produced by the Bell Laboratories.\nIn our hunting, we found some gems. There was this 1953 letter from Alan Turing to Claude Shannon:\nAlmost one year later to the day, Alan Turing would be dead. His death was ruled a suicide, though its circumstances remain in dispute to this day.\nOther letters were more light-hearted. We chuckled at the correspondence Shannon had with Dr. Carl Sagan (about, of all things, a poem about Rubik\u2019s cubes that Shannon had written):\nDr. Sagan\u2019s response:\nThere were items that didn\u2019t necessarily speak to Shannon\u2019s scientific collaborations but gave us a window into his personality. We found, for example, a purchase order Shannon made while at Bell Labs. It wasn\u2019t the most consequential historical artifact, but after reading so many of Shannon\u2019s serious academic papers, the detailed account of these purchases brought the tinkering Shannon to life:\nAnd so on. All of this wading through paper sounds like a lot of work, and it was \u2014 but it is also a thrill, the absolute best part of biographical research. Yes, you have to sift through a lot of historical hay, but every now and again, you find a needle in the palm of your hand.\nOne example: the day we found the wedding announcement for Claude Shannon\u2019s parents. It was front page news in 1909 Gaylord, MI (Shannon\u2019s hometown), and the details \u2014 how Claude\u2019s father caught a train in the middle of the night to the home of his future in-laws; what Claude\u2019s mother\u2019s wedding dress looked like the day of \u2014 added texture to our narrative.\nFinding that nugget of news felt like hitting a game-winning shot. And there were enough moments like that to help us power through the five years it took to finish the book.\nBut no day, no moment, was quite like the one when we found a 1952 Claude Shannon speech that had been all but forgotten. Claude Shannon thought about and wrote about many things \u2014 but he didn\u2019t pontificate about creativity, or thinking, or genius. Better, he thought, to do those things than to talk about them.\nThere was one exception, though, and it was a speech he gave in 1952 to his fellow Bell Labs engineers. The speech was in a volume of unpublished papers, buried toward the end.\nWe\u2019ve written about it elsewhere, adding our own interpretation to a genius\u2019s musings on genius. But for the sake of giving Shannon fans \u2014 both old and new \u2014 the same thrill we had when we stumbled on this speech, we decided to put the full text of it here.\nUp to 100% of the amount of ideas produced, useful good ideas produced by these signals, these are supposed to be arranged in order of increasing ability. At producing ideas, we find a curve something like this. Consider the number of curves produced here \u2014 going up to enormous height here.\nA very small percentage of the population produces the greatest proportion of the important ideas. This is akin to an idea presented by an English mathematician, Turing, that the human brain is something like a piece of uranium. The human brain, if it is below the critical lap and you shoot one neutron into it, additional more would be produced by impact. It leads to an extremely explosive of the issue, increase the size of the uranium. Turing says this is something like ideas in the human brain. There are some people if you shoot one idea into the brain, you will get a half an idea out. There are other people who are beyond this point at which they produce two ideas for each idea sent in. Those are the people beyond the knee of the curve. I don\u2019t want to sound egotistical here, I don\u2019t think that I am beyond the knee of this curve and I don\u2019t know anyone who is. I do know some people that were. I think, for example, that anyone will agree that Isaac Newton would be well on the top of this curve. When you think that at the age of 25 he had produced enough science, physics and mathematics to make 10 or 20 men famous \u2014 he produced binomial theorem, differential and integral calculus, laws of gravitation, laws of motion, decomposition of white light, and so on. Now what is it that shoots one up to this part of the curve? What are the basic requirements? I think we could set down three things that are fairly necessary for scientific research or for any sort of inventing or mathematics or physics or anything along that line. I don\u2019t think a person can get along without any one of these three.\nThe first one is obvious \u2014 training and experience. You don\u2019t expect a lawyer, however bright he may be, to give you a new theory of physics these days or mathematics or engineering.\nThe second thing is a certain amount of intelligence or talent. In other words, you have to have an IQ that is fairly high to do good research work. I don\u2019t think that there is any good engineer or scientist that can get along on an IQ of 100, which is the average for human beings. In other words, he has to have an IQ higher than that. Everyone in this room is considerably above that. This, we might say, is a matter of environment; intelligence is a matter of heredity.\nThose two I don\u2019t think are sufficient. I think there is a third constituent here, a third component which is the one that makes an Einstein or an Isaac Newton. For want of a better word, we will call it motivation. In other words, you have to have some kind of a drive, some kind of a desire to find out the answer, a desire to find out what makes things tick. If you don\u2019t have that, you may have all the training and intelligence in the world, you don\u2019t have questions and you won\u2019t just find answers. This is a hard thing to put your finger on. It is a matter of temperament probably; that is, a matter of probably early training, early childhood experiences, whether you will motivate in the direction of scientific research. I think that at a superficial level, it is blended use of several things. This is not any attempt at a deep analysis at all, but my feeling is that a good scientist has a great deal of what we can call curiosity. I won\u2019t go any deeper into it than that. He wants to know the answers. He\u2019s just curious how things tick and he wants to know the answers to questions; and if he sees thinks, he wants to raise questions and he wants to know the answers to those.\nThen there\u2019s the idea of dissatisfaction. By this I don\u2019t mean a pessimistic dissatisfaction of the world \u2014 we don\u2019t like the way things are \u2014 I mean a constructive dissatisfaction. The idea could be expressed in the words, This is OK, but I think things could be done better. I think there is a neater way to do this. I think things could be improved a little. In other words, there is continually a slight irritation when things don\u2019t look quite right; and I think that dissatisfaction in present days is a key driving force in good scientists.\nAnd another thing I\u2019d put down here is the pleasure in seeing net results or methods of arriving at results needed, designs of engineers, equipment, and so on. I get a big bang myself out of providing a theorem. If I\u2019ve been trying to prove a mathematical theorem for a week or so and I finally find the solution, I get a big bang out of it. And I get a big kick out of seeing a clever way of doing some engineering problem, a clever design for a circuit which uses a very small amount of equipment and gets apparently a great deal of result out of it. I think so far as motivation is concerned, it is maybe a little like Fats Waller said about swing music \u2014 \u201ceither you got it or you ain\u2019t.\u2019\u2019 if you ain\u2019t got it, you probably shouldn\u2019t be doing research work if you don\u2019t want to know that kind of answer. Although people without this kind of motivation might be very successful in other fields, the research man should probably have an extremely strong drive to want to find out the answers, so strong a drive that he doesn\u2019t care whether it is 5 o\u2019clock \u2014 he is willing to work all night to find out the answers and al weekend if necessary. Well now, this is all well and good, but supposing a person has these three properties to a sufficient extent to be useful, are there any tricks, any gimmicks that he can apply to thinking that will actually aid in creative work, in getting the answers in research work, in general, in finding answers to problems? I think there are, and I think they can be catalogued to an certain extent. You can make quite a list of them and I think they would be very useful if one did that, so I am going to give a few of them which I have thought up or which people have suggested to me. And I think if one consciously applied these to various problems you had to solve, in many cases you\u2019d find solutions quicker than you would normally or in cases where you might not find it at all. I thing that good research workers apply these things unconsciously; that is, they do these things automatically and if they were brought forth into the conscious thinking that here\u2019s a situation where I would try this method of approach that would probably get there faster, although I can\u2019t document this statement.\nThe first one that I might speak of is the idea of simplification. Suppose that you are given a problem to solve, I don\u2019t care what kind of a problem \u2014 a machine to design, or a physical theory to develop, or a mathematical theorem to prove, or something of that kind \u2014 probably a very powerful approach to this is to attempt to eliminate everything from the problem except the essentials; that is, cut it down to size. Almost every problem that you come across is befuddled with all kinds of extraneous data of one sort or another; and if you can bring this problem down into the main issues, you can see more clearly what you\u2019re trying to do and perhaps find a solution. Now, in so doing, you may have stripped away the problem that you\u2019re after. You may have simplified it to a point that it doesn\u2019t even resemble the problem that you started with; but very often if you can solve this simple problem, you can add refinements to the solution of this until you get back to the solution of the one you started with.\nA very similar device is seeking similar known problems. I think I could illustrate this schematically in this way. You have a problem P here and there is a solution S which you do not know yet perhaps over here. If you have experience in the field represented, that you are working in, you may perhaps know of a somewhat similar problem, call it P\u2019, which has already been solved and which has a solution, S\u2019, all you need to do \u2014 all you may have to do is find the analogy from P\u2019 here to P and the same analogy from S\u2019 to S in order to get back to the solution of the given problem. This is the reason why experience in a field is so important that if you are experienced in a field, you will know thousands of problems that have been solved. Your mental matrix will be filled with P\u2019s and S\u2019s unconnected here and you can find one which is tolerably close to the P that you are trying to solve and go over to the corresponding S\u2019 in order to go back to the S you\u2019re after. It seems to be much easier to make two small jumps than the one big jump in any kind of mental thinking.\nAnother approach for a given problem is to try to restate it in just as many different forms as you can. Change the words. Change the viewpoint. Look at it from every possible angle. After you\u2019ve done that, you can try to look at it from several angles at the same time and perhaps you can get an insight into the real basic issues of the problem, so that you can correlate the important factors and come out with the solution. It\u2019s difficult really to do this, but it is important that you do. If you don\u2019t, it is very easy to get into ruts of mental thinking. You start with a problem here and you go around a circle here and if you could only get over to this point, perhaps you would see your way clear; but you can\u2019t break loose from certain mental blocks which are holding you in certain ways of looking at a problem. That is the reason why very frequently someone who is quite green to a problem will sometimes come in and look at it and find the solution like that, while you have been laboring for months over it. You\u2019ve got set into some ruts here of mental thinking and someone else comes in and sees it from a fresh viewpoint.\nAnother mental gimmick for aid in research work, I think, is the idea of generalization. This is very powerful in mathematical research. The typical mathematical theory developed in the following way to prove a very isolated, special result, particular theorem \u2014 someone always will come along and start generalization it. He will leave it where it was in two dimensions before he will do it in N dimensions; or if it was in some kind of algebra, he will work in a general algebraic field; if it was in the field of real numbers, he will change it to a general algebraic field or something of that sort. This is actually quite easy to do if you only remember to do it. If the minute you\u2019ve found an answer to something, the next thing to do is to ask yourself if you can generalize this anymore \u2014 can I make the same, make a broader statement which includes more \u2014 there, I think, in terms of engineering, the same thing should be kept in mind. As you see, if somebody comes along with a clever way of doing something, one should ask oneself \u201cCan I apply the same principle in more general ways? Can I use this same clever idea represented here to solve a larger class of problems? Is there any place else that I can use this particular thing?\u201d\nNext one I might mention is the idea of structural analysis of a problem. Suppose you have your problem here and a solution here. You may have too big a jump to take. What you can try to do is to break down that jump into a large number of small jumps. If this were a set of mathematical axioms and this were a theorem or conclusion that you were trying to prove, it might be too much for me try to prove this thing in one fell swoop. But perhaps I can visualize a number of subsidiary theorems or propositions such that if I could prove those, in turn I would eventually arrive at this solution. In other words, I set up some path through this domain with a set of subsidiary solutions, 1, 2, 3, 4, and so on, and attempt to prove this on the basis of that and then this one the basis of these which I have proved until eventually I arrive at the path S. Many proofs in mathematics have been actually found by extremely roundabout processes. A man starts to prove this theorem and he finds that he wanders all over the map. He starts off and prove a good many results which don\u2019t seem to be leading anywhere and then eventually ends up by the back door on the solution of the given problem; and very often when that\u2019s done, when you\u2019ve found your solution, it may be very easy to simplify; that is, to see at one stage that you may have short-cutted across here and you could see that you might have short-cutted across there. The same thing is true in design work. If you can design a way of doing something which is obviously clumsy and cumbersome, uses too much equipment; but after you\u2019ve really got something you can get a grip on, something you can hang on to, you can start cutting out components and seeing some parts were really superfluous. You really didn\u2019t need them in the first place.\nNow one other thing I would like to bring out which I run across quite frequently in mathematical work is the idea of inversion of the problem. You are trying to obtain the solution S on the basis of the premises P and then you can\u2019t do it. Well, turn the problem over supposing that S were the given proposition, the given axioms, or the given numbers in the problem and what you are trying to obtain is P. Just imagine that that were the case. Then you will find that it is relatively easy to solve the problem in that direction. You find a fairly direct route. If so, it\u2019s often possible to invent it in small batches. In other words, you\u2019ve got a path marked out here \u2014 there you got relays you sent this way. You can see how to invert these things in small stages and perhaps three or four only difficult steps in the proof.\nNow I think the same thing can happen in design work. Sometimes I have had the experience of designing computing machines of various sorts in which I wanted to compute certain numbers out of certain given quantities. This happened to be a machine that played the game of nim and it turned out that it seemed to be quite difficult. If took quite a number of relays to do this particular calculation although it could be done. But then I got the idea that if I inverted the problem, it would have been very easy to do \u2014 if the given and required results had been interchanged; and that idea led to a way of doing it which was far simpler than the first design. The way of doing it was doing it by feedback; that is, you start with the required result and run it back until \u2014 run it through its value until it matches the given input. So the machine itself was worked backward putting range S over the numbers until it had the number that you actually had and, at that point, until it reached the number such that P shows you the correct way. Well, now the solution for this philosophy which is probably very boring to most of you. I\u2019d like now to show you this machine which I brought along and go into one or two of the problems which were connected with the design of that because I think they illustrate some of these things I\u2019ve been talking about.\nIn order to see this, you\u2019ll have to come up around it; so, I wonder whether you will all come up around the table now.\n", "claps": "1.6K claps", "author": "Jimmy Soni", "comments": [], "link": "https://medium.com/the-mission/a-genius-explains-how-to-be-creative-claude-shannons-long-lost-1952-speech-fbbcb2ebe07f"}, {"title": "I Read All Forty-One Discworld Novels.

After all, most people in Starbucks are fumbling with smartphones or laptops, not antiquated ink and paper.\nI was tucked in a corner seat, scratching down ideas in my leather-bound field notes with my Namiki retractable fountain pen.\n\u201cYou have such beautiful handwriting,\u201d she said.\n\u201cThank you. I think it\u2019s my obsessive compulsive nature.\u201d It was a lie, but judging by her business attire, I figured she needed to get to work. The truth would have delayed her.\nThe truth is, it\u2019s not my handwriting. Maybe bits and pieces, but the bones of it belong to two people I loved very much. My father and my Aunt Cynthia.\nDad\u2019s copperplate handwriting looked like something from the Constitutional convention. His cursive letters were evenly placed, with artful yet restrained loops and curves.\nI have early memories of my boyhood, sitting on Dad\u2019s knee as he penned legal briefs on yellow notepads with his Parker 21 fountain pen.\nI\u2019d sit transfixed, watching his beefy hand compose elegant letters across the page. With age and maturity, I grew to respect the intellect behind his written words. But most of all, I fell in love with the art of his penmanship.\nMy great Aunt Cynthia Weiss lived in Florida, where she inked letters to our family back in northern California.\nDad and Aunt Cynthia were close. Both possessed strong intellects and similar views about life and politics. They also shared a unique discipline that is quickly dying these days: remarkable penmanship.\nWhere Dad\u2019s cursive leaned to the right like Abraham Lincoln\u2019s, Aunt Cynthia\u2019s letters were crafted upright, with a slight tilt to the left. Both ran straight across the page, without the assist of lines, and displayed artful loops and curves. Both of their handwriting styles were expressive and beautiful to me.\nKids used to be taught the same cursive writing system in grade school (such as the Palmer method). Yet over time, they develop their own unique hand.\nFor some, the script becomes messy or illegible. Others resort to block printing. A few rise above the crowd and produce beautiful penmanship, like my Dad and Aunt Cynthia.\nI don\u2019t know if it\u2019s an artful sensibility that informed my Dad and Aunt Cynthia\u2019s penmanship, but receiving letters from them was always a joy. Each correspondence and note was like a little piece of artwork.\nIn college, my father would pen weekly letters to me. He always included some money, which was great, but the real joy was his letters. Aunt Cynthia wrote to me too, also sending money here and there.\nI have little recollection where the cash was spent (probably beer and pizza) but those letters found their way into a shoebox. Little gems of artfulness tucked away for posterity. Time capsules of ink and letters formed into elegant script, expressing love and support from my Dad and Aunt Cynthia.\nEvery time I pull out those old letters to re-read their words and admire their writing, I am transported back in time. It\u2019s like, through my memories, I am able to resurrect the spirits of my Dad and Aunt Cynthia.\nMaybe that\u2019s why I emulated their handwriting over the years? To keep a bit of them alive. With each swirl, controlled loop and even placement, it\u2019s like I\u2019m channeling their spirits. Conjuring their artful presence. I guess it just makes me feel good.\nOf course, adopting the personal handwriting of loved ones long gone comes at a cost. While the familiarity warms my heart, I am never able to completely capture their styles, which frustrates me to no end. So, there is some truth to my claim of obsessive compulsiveness.\nI toil to capture the look of my father\u2019s writing and Aunt Cynthia\u2019s style, but then my own hand edges into the mix. Sometimes I wonder where my authentic hand begins and the borrowed lettering ends. Ah, the frustrations of an artful soul.\nYou may not think your artwork and creative expression matters, but you\u2019d be mistaken. Maybe you\u2019re a weekend watercolorist or part-time poet. Perhaps you write music or short stories. Despite work and the commitments of life, you squeeze in time for your art.\nWhatever artful expression you do, don\u2019t get discouraged and keep at it. Why? Because it matters in ways you may not realize. Beyond money or fame, your creative expression is a vital part of who you are. And it can touch others in unexpected ways.\nI\u2019ll bet my father and Aunt Cynthia never imagined I\u2019d keep their letters and emulate their handwriting. Little did they know how much their artful penmanship would mean to me. The joy those letters still bring.\nI think if I explained all this to the woman at Starbucks, her eyes might have glazed over. I suspect left-brained people probably view all this art stuff with confusion. \u201cWhy not just write with a laptop, it\u2019s way more efficient?\u201d\nThe thing is, I do write with a laptop. Usually, after the initial ideas and thoughts have been inked in my notebooks and journals.\nEvery time my fountain pen touches paper, it\u2019s like I\u2019m back on my Dad\u2019s knee, and he\u2019s penning another letter or legal brief.\nIt\u2019s like I\u2019m a little boy again, basking in the protective love and guidance of my father.\nIt\u2019s like Aunt Cynthia is still here, with her hugs and Christmas letters. It\u2019s like the past comes alive again, and I can retreat briefly from this fast-paced, digital world. To a simpler time, before email, when girls sent perfumed letters and handwriting was still somewhat of an art form.\nAll this nostalgia, fond memories and artful inspiration, from letters penned long ago. A father\u2019s grand old cursive, and a loving Aunt\u2019s steady hand. Both, with their fine script, did more than memorialize their creative expression and affection.\nThey inspired in me the same love of penmanship, writing, and creative expression. In this way, they live on, and the pain of their loss is lessened a little.\nThis is why your creative expression matters so much. Because rather than fame or fortune, it just might inspire some artful joy in others. And that is a gift that can last a lifetime.\nI\u2019m John P. Weiss. I paint, draw and write about life.

And recently, they made a surprising discovery.\nThe cre\u0300me de la cre\u0300me \u2014 or \u2018expert performers\u2019, as they\u2019re officially known \u2014 all have something in common.\n(And it\u2019s not 10,000 hours.)\nIn Malcolm Gladwell\u2019s 2008 book, Outliers: The Story of Success, he pinpoints 10,000 as the \u2018magic number\u2019 of hours a person needs to devote to their craft to become an expert.\nHe cites people like Bill Gates and the Beatles, who famously invested vast amounts of time to sharpening their skill-set.\nHis theory is based on the research of Dr. K. Anders Ericsson, a professor of psychology who has pioneered the study and science of peak performance.\nBut Ericsson does not entirely agree with Gladwell\u2019s conclusions. In fact, he calls them:\nAccording to Ericsson, becoming an expert in something isn\u2019t just a matter of clocking up thousands of hours. What distinguishes a virtuoso violinist or an Olympic athlete from the rest of us is how they spend these hours.\nEnter deliberate practice.\nThere\u2019s a common assumption that talent is something we are, or aren\u2019t, born with.\nBut Ericsson believes that genetics play less of a role than we think.\nTake Mozart. Almost anyone would consider him to be a musical genius. But according to Ericsson,\nHe claims that Mozart achieved mastery not due to inherited talent, but because he practiced long and hard from a very young age.\nSo is a conviction that we lack the necessary talent the only factor holding us back from being the next Steve Jobs?\nNot quite.\nThere is significant evidence to show that working memory is heritable, and that cognitive ability as a child plays a role in adult achievement.\nBut no matter a person\u2019s genetics, expertise can\u2019t be built without working hard \u2014 and smart \u2014 over many years.\nTypically, repeated practice takes us up to a medium level of success. After an initial spike, progress stalls, plateaus \u2014 then grinds to a halt.\nBecause when you reach an average level of competence, your ability stops being a work-in-progress and starts being a reflex.\nThat\u2019s why repeating a skill regularly over many years alone \u2014 cooking, driving, exercising \u2014 doesn\u2019t lead to expertise.\nYou\u2019re maintaining a skill, not building on it.\nAnd for most areas in our lives, a baseline level of skill is enough. But if we want to truly excel, we have to push past this complacency and out of our comfort zone.\nPeople who continually improve never slump into auto-pilot.\nInstead, they keep taking apart the pieces of their skill and putting them back together to create something better.\nRather than treading water, they take their practice to the edge of their ability, and then step (or leap) beyond it.\nAuthor and entrepreneur Michael Simmons discovered a common denominator that ties in with Ericsson\u2019s research.\nSimmons refers to this as the \u2018five-hour rule\u2019: one hour, each weekday, devoted to highly-concentrated learning.\nAnd it\u2019s these consistent, intense bursts of effort that sets them \u2014 and other highly-accomplished people throughout history \u2014 apart.\nSounds a bit more manageable than the 10,000 hour rule, doesn\u2019t it?\nBut it\u2019s not always easy.\nPerforming skills you already know is satisfying \u2014 but this won\u2019t enhance your skill level.\nSo, deliberate practice isn\u2019t just about continued repetition.\nIt\u2019s structured. It\u2019s thoughtful. It\u2019s strategic.\nYou aren\u2019t just mindlessly practicing. You\u2019re intensely engaged. You\u2019re teetering on the edge of what you are and aren\u2019t capable of doing.\nIt shouldn\u2019t feel comfortable.\nLike a rubber band, you\u2019re constantly stretching yourself to your outer limits. There needs to be constant pressure and impetus for change.\nAnd if you aren\u2019t clearly moving forward with one technique, you go back to the drawing board.\nIn other words, if you achieved something yesterday, you must do more than achieve it again today.\nThere\u2019s no standstill.\nThat\u2019s how growth happens.\nDeveloping proficiency in any skill is not always fun, or even enjoyable.\nI\u2019ve learnt this firsthand over the 12 years (and counting) it took me to build my company, JotForm.\nI\u2019ve been with my product, fed up with myself and fed up with grappling with yet another issue.\nWhat\u2019s made me hang in is visualizing where the time I spend developing a new or greater understanding will take me.\nAnd by listening to my resistance instead of fighting it, I was able to grow JotForm to almost 4 million users without any outside funding.\nStill, to push through these feelings, day in, day out, you\u2019re going to need to build smart systems to support you.\nHere\u2019s how to get the ball rolling.\nYou need to keep your eyes firmly on the prize to keep up momentum.\nThat\u2019s why wishy washy goals like \u2018getting better\u2019 won\u2019t be compelling enough to propel you past your current abilities \u2014 on their own, at least.\nAnd as I\u2019ve written before, lofty goals will intimidate \u2014 and throw you off track.\nThe alternative? Bite-sized, clearly-defined, achievable steps in the right direction.\nSmall goals are foundation of deliberate practice. They should take into account your current knowledge and push your limits, little by little, towards meaningful change.\nThis means distilling your general, long-term goal \u2014 improvement \u2014 into a series of concrete building blocks.\nLong-term goal: become an expert runner\nMedium goal: run the 2019 marathon\nSmall steps to get there: reduce your running time by 5 minutes every week.\nIdentify main areas for change. Write them down. Make a checklist. Rooting goals in specificity will encourage action. Once you have a clear system in place, everything else will slot into place.\nProlonged, sustained effort is often uncomfortable or frustrating. And that\u2019s the whole point.\nDeliberate practice isn\u2019t necessarily enjoyable: you\u2019ll need to sacrifice short-term pleasure for long-term success.\nThis dilemma applies to most things in everyday life. Take me as an example.\nWhen people ask me how I was able to grow JotForm to a company of 110 employees without any investment, many of them want me to talk about passion or tell inspiring stories.\nThe truth is, I\u2019ve never been super passionate about building forms. I didn\u2019t follow my dreams.\nI just showed up and put in the boring work every single day over the last 12 years while I watched countless competitors enter & leave our market.\nIt wasn\u2019t always fun, especially when you try to build your startup in one of the most competitive industries around: online forms. Even Google Forms stepped into the ring and remains one of our toughest competitors.\nBut it\u2019s pushing through this frustration that leads to significant improvement. It\u2019s getting on with it especially when you\u2019re too tired and can\u2019t be bothered.\nDeliberate practice is only effective because of its regularity.\nSo commit to your hour per day, and protect it at all costs. Soon, action will become habit and there will be no decision left to make. That\u2019s where the magic happens.\nTo progress in any area, you need to pinpoint your strengths and weaknesses to identify problems and solutions.\nBe methodical, and keep track of your progress everyday.\nIt\u2019s also crucial to seek out regular feedback: from existing experts and peers as well as through self-assessment. An honest perspective is essential for gaining a realistic view of your progress.\nWrite it down. Record it. Measure it. Repeat.\nDeliberate practice requires your full, undivided, 1000% attention. That\u2019s why it can only be sustained for short periods.\nExperts have capped optimal practice time at one hour per day, three-to-five days a week, with reduced benefits after two hours.\nSo keep it short and sweet, however tempting it might be to push on when you feel like you\u2019re nailing it. Set an alarm, and be strict on yourself to duck out when the hour is up.\nWhy? You need to recharge.\nExtreme focus is a tough mental workout, and you\u2019ll only feel its benefits if you give yourself time to recover. Counteract the intensity of deliberate practice by doing nothing at all.\nYour body, and your brain, will thank you.\nOriginally published at www.jotform.com.\n", "claps": "44K claps", "author": "Aytekin Tank", "comments": ["Great article!

I am just getting to know this doctor. I am still adjusting to life in a somewhat rural community. My Chiropractor is a devout Christian. He loves baseball and there is a large American flag decorating the wall in the waiting room. In the treatment room, a plaque reads \u201cOur God is a great God\u201d. He is a good-hearted man.\nFor spring break, my doctor visited California with his family. I overheard him talking to another patient in the hallway about his trip to San Francisco and about her trip to Disneyland. When the nurse came in to check my blood pressure, she asked if I had taken a vacation with my family for spring break (it is very common for people to try to get to sunnier weather this time of year). I joked that my wife\u2019s new \u201cadulting job\u201d doesn\u2019t seem to include much time off and how ironic it is that we did more traveling when we were living on a shoestring budget. The nurse responded that she enjoyed meeting my wife last week and we both agreed that she is pretty great: smart, articulate and always even-tempered.\nI tried to not think about all of the qualities that I lack. I tried to keep my mind from wandering back to California and my friends back home who \u201cknow me\u201d. I tried to rub the feeling of being an outsider out of my eyes and to be grateful to have a good blood pressure reading.\nThe nurse noticed my wet rain jacket and I explained that I had walked to my appointment. We laughed about how quickly a sprinkle can turn into a downpour. When the Chiropractor came in, he mentioned my jacket as well. I had carefully hung it onto a chair, damp side up, away from the wall to avoid getting anything wet. It has been raining a lot this week and some of the streets are flooded in nearby areas. I used to love springtime in California but here, it feels more like winter with flowers.\nMy new Chiropractor is friendly and somehow we started talking about his training. He shared that he had never met an openly gay person until he attended Chiropractic school. He told me that his mentor had been a lesbian and that she had been very understanding. When he expressed his curiosity about her sexual orientation, she welcomed him to ask respectful questions. He explained how much she helped him to see that despite their differences, people can share much in common. They are still close friends to this day.\nHe asked me if I had experienced much in the way of homophobia since I had moved to this area. I told him that the homophobia was not much different than elsewhere but that I wasn\u2019t used to the racism that I had been encountering. I mentioned the two conversations with neighbors that made me feel uneasy. Both conversations seemed to arise randomly.\nOne neighbor was discussing a college club in which his granddaughter was involved. He announced that he disapproved of the club and added abruptly that no one can make him stop hating \u201csome people.\u201d He punctuated the statement with a long steely look into my eyes. This neighbor is elderly and his wife is friendly and so, I still see him and we haven\u2019t had any more unpleasant interactions.\nThe other neighbor (different occasion) was wearing an Army Vietnam Veteran cap and I mentioned that both of my Uncles were Army Veterans and fought in Vietnam and that it had been a difficult time for them. He responded tersely that he enjoyed the killing in Vietnam and that he would do it again if he could. The conversation descended swiftly from there, as if there was much further to fall, into something about the Mexicans who took away his son\u2019s chance at a decent education. We still wave at each other when he is out riding his motorcycle but we haven\u2019t actually spoken since.\nThese conversations came up when I was delivering fresh blueberries from my garden. I wish I was better at small talk, or at minimum, that I wasn\u2019t the type of person people feel so at ease with being candid. It can be awkward when you look \u201cwhite\u201d but are the child of an immigrant from Central America. People speak their minds in this town and I usually appreciate that quality in a person. However, when people say disparaging things to me about Latinos or other minorities, at first, without knowing about my heritage and later, without caring, it can be difficult to manage.\nI told my Chiropractor that I missed my friends in Calfornia and that despite the rat race, congestion and smog, I missed the cultural diversity, museums, and great food. When he adjusted my back, it made an unusually loud crunch. He replied that the rain gets him down too and I got the feeling with everything that he didn\u2019t say, that he might be considering relocating to California.\nI sat up and felt a little dizzy and my doctor, who is a very inquisitive man, asked me if I attended church. I explained that I was once a very devout Christian but that my church rejected me when I came to terms with my sexual orientation. I clarified that I am basically agnostic now \u2014 that, I don\u2019t know \u2014 and that it seems to take as much faith to firmly not believe in God as it does to be a true believer; both are strong convictions and I am not sold on either argument, at this point in my life. I added, awkwardly, that I enjoy the teachings of Buddhism. I paused, still feeling a little dizzy and continued like a distracted driver barrelling through a red light: It seems to be the nature of man to create a God that reflects his own image and that although all religions teach love, it troubles me that people kill each other in the name of their Gods.\nA long silence hovered above us and I wished that I could delete my spoken words. In retrospect, I think he was probably thinking that church might be a place where I could make friends or something. I missed the cue.\nMy doctor completed one last adjustment to my neck and I heard a loud snap; It didn\u2019t hurt but I felt a little dizzier and this time, he looked a little dizzy too. I worried that my last comment made me sound like I was opposed to religion. So, I added one last log to the fire and chirped, despite my reservations about God\u2019s existence, I try to live a spiritual life.\nAt that point, I could tell that we were both unsure of what that actually meant. We smiled at each other, said a quick see ya\u2019 next time! He opened the door and left the room. I exhaled and wished that I could be more like my wife. She never seems to get into these types of conversations. She just delivers the blueberries and everyone comments on the weather.\nI put my damp jacket and shoes back on and proceeded to walk down the hallway as I continued turning my thoughts over like smooth stones in a river. I half-consciously offered a friendly nod and thank you to the nurse and receptionist and headed back out back into the rain.\nI walked in a daze, pushing down the memory of my old youth pastor. I was trying to hold back the conversation that I had with him over thirty years ago, the last time I attended church, when I confided that I thought I might be gay. They say that timing is everything, but really, no time would have been the right time for that little chat. He responded with a fast and stern warning to not come back until I was sure I was straight. I saw a flash of fire and brimstone in his eyes and I left, at a fast clip, once and for all.\nI reminded myself of how long ago that was but pondered how it could feel like only yesterday.\nI inhaled and exhaled deeply as I redirected my mind back to my new Chiropractor, reassuring myself that he was different; Things have changed and I am far from being a teenage church girl. I don\u2019t need to listen to that pointless and dusty old echo in my head.\nWhen I was a Christian, I believed that this literally meant to be Christ-like. I took that seriously. For me, it meant that I would give my life to save my fellow man. It meant that I loved my neighbor \u2014 no matter who they happened to be. I also believed that we, as humans, were directed by God to take care of each other and to protect the precious earth that God had created.\nIf that is what it truly is to be a Christian, then, I suppose that I would still be/still am. Unfortunately, not all Christians interpret their Bibles in the same way. Many do not welcome me, or people like me, into their businesses, places of worship or communities. Some would reject Jesus himself if he came to their front door looking like a dark-skinned and bearded immigrant. There is no point in mentioning that the Last Supper seemed a lot like Passover, when you are uninvited.\nI no longer hold enough faith to fully believe or disbelieve in any one story of God. Still, despite my agnosticism, I see traces of the face of God within others, nature, all living things and within myself. I realize now that if I am a reflection of God, I must mirror a heartbroken and somewhat confused God.\nI still love with a heart that loves unconditionally, despite the great sadness that I feel. I have met Godly people in every walk of life, both religious and outside of religion. If I ever find the faith to believe again, it will be to believe in a nameless God that does not prefer one child over another.\nThank you for reading \u2014 Noe\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 Noe.

According to the Gospel of John in the New Testament, Mary Magdalene came to the tomb where Jesus was buried and found it empty. An angel told her that Jesus had risen.\nEaster, also called Pascha (Greek, Latin) or Resurrection Sunday, is a festival and holiday celebrating the resurrection of Jesus from the dead, described in the New Testament as having occurred on the third day of his burial after his crucifixion by the Romans at Calvary c. 30 AD.\nThe Bible states that if Jesus hadn\u2019t risen, Christian preaching and faith would have been \u201cin vain\u201d or even \u201cempty.\u201d In other words, the belief that Christians have in Jesus\u2019 divinity is rooted in the moment of his resurrection. Without that part of the Easter story, Jesus simply dies and that\u2019s it.\nYou can also look at it as the meaning of Easter is Jesus Christ\u2019s victory over death. His resurrection symbolizes the eternal life that is granted to all who believe in Him. The meaning of Easter also symbolizes the complete verification of all that Jesus preached and taught during His three-year ministry. If He had not risen from the dead, if He had merely died and not been resurrected, He would have been considered just another teacher or Rabbi. However, His resurrection changed all that and gave final and irrefutable proof that He was really the Son of God and that He had conquered death once and for all.\nHowever, HOLY LAND MAN thinks that Easter did not always symbolize Christ\u2019s resurrection from the dead and the meaning of Easter was quite different than what Christians celebrate today. The feast day of Easter was originally a pagan celebration of renewal and rebirth. Celebrated in the early spring, it honored the pagan Saxon goddess Eastre.\nWhen the early missionaries converted the Saxons to Christianity, the holiday, since it fell around the same time as the traditional memorial of Christ\u2019s resurrection from the dead, was merged with the pagan celebration, and became know as Easter. The meaning of Easter was also changed to reflect its new Christian orientation.\nToday, the meaning of Easter, for millions of Christians, is that of honoring and recognizing Jesus Christ\u2019s resurrection from the dead, and His glorious promises of eternal life for all who believe in Him.\nDon Karl Juravin researched the word Easter and it might have derived from a springtime Anglo-Saxon fertility goddess called Eastre (known as Eostre, in German and in Norse as Ostara), whose symbolism included the hare, the moon and eggs. But that figure is disputed, and others say it derives from the word \u2018east\u2019, \u2018dawn\u2019 or from the Norse word for the spring season3. Easter is steeped in the symbolism of cycle of the sun, which rises in the East, and which in spring fondles the natural world to life. In the Northern Hemisphere, the spring equinox occurs on the 21st of March when the length of the day increases until it is equal with the length of the night.\nThe sun, growing in power, finally overtakes darkness, and this solar rebirth is celebrated in most ancient pagan religions, where agricultural life depended on the growth of spring. The other symbol of ancient solar superstition was the moon; and even today, Christians still celebrate their version of Easter on the first Sunday on or after the first Full Moon after the March equinox, tying Easter to its historical pagan roots.\nThe images of Easter include two of the most ancient and universal symbols of birth, nature, fertility, life, and rebirth: the egg and the rabbit. We told anthropomorphized stories to explain why the sun, and nature, waxed and waned with the seasons, and thus Adonis, Attis, Dionysus, Osiris, and many other Greek and Roman cults celebrated the death and rebirth of their gods at this time of year9. Since the very first centuries,\nI also found out that Easter, also called Pascha (Greek, Latin) or Resurrection Sunday, is a festival and holiday celebrating the resurrection of Jesus from the dead, described in the New Testament as having occurred on the third day of his burial after his crucifixion by the Romans at Calvary c. 30 AD.\nCE Christian apologists have had to defend themselves against accusations that the Jesus story was a retelling of pagan myths9. The beloved chocolate egg has now come to be the ubiquitous and central image of Easter and the Easter holidays, and the Easter Bunny can often be seen delivering (and hiding) them, reminding us that Easter is a pagan, sun-worshipping festival.\nHappy Easter\n", "claps": "2K claps", "author": "JURAVIN (Don Karl Juravin)", "comments": [], "link": "https://medium.com/@Juravin/happy-easter-what-does-it-mean-41958a14555e"}, {"title": "Racism, Homophobia, and Religion \u2013 James Finn - The Blog \u2013 Medium", "num_comments": 8, "tags": ["christianity", "equaity", "religion", "lgbtq", "faith"], "reading_time": 3, "text": "I spent an odd evening on Twitter tonight. I meant to promote a few Medium stories; that\u2019s all. My heart wasn\u2019t even in it. I\u2019m tired. I was going through the motions. I was mourning Easter, feeling like a despised pariah, wishing for love and community and acceptance, knowing I don\u2019t have it and probably never will.\nI tweeted a few links to old stories, reminding allies that as a gay man, I\u2019m exhausted that beloved, respected institutions like the Roman Catholic Church and conservative Protestant churches morally condemn me and other LGBTQ people.\nWhen I read the Catholic catechism and see that it calls me depraved, I cry.

Have you ever gotten on your knees, clasped your hands together, prayed to God and felt as if God simply didn\u2019t hear you?\nYou ask for something and its as if he\u2019s not even listening. You dialed the prayer hotline and all you get is a voicemail as if he\u2019s not there.\nIs he there? Does he even exist?\nThe answer is yes. But just because we didn\u2019t get what we asked for doesn\u2019t mean he didn\u2019t answer our prayers or that he doesn\u2019t exist.\nA lot of people think God doesn\u2019t answer prayer because some things don\u2019t go their way. What they don\u2019t realize is that God did answer their prayers he just said no, wait, or we simply weren\u2019t paying attention.\nHave you ever asked your parents for something and they said no?\nDid you question whether or not they replied?\nProbably not.\nIt\u2019s the same thing with God; sometimes he just says no. We have to stop thinking is that no means an unanswered prayer.\nA parent who gives their child everything they want spoils them to no end and when it\u2019s time for that child to be on their own they\u2019ll be looking around for someone to take care of them because they are unable to stand on their own.\nBut our heavenly father is much different. As much as we complain, pout, kick and scream we won\u2019t always get what we want.\nWhy?\nBecause He wants us to be independent. He is testing our faith to make sure we can stand strong when things don\u2019t go our way. He wants to know that when things get hard we can be firm and trust that he will meet our needs.\nBut sometimes when he says no its because He wants what\u2019s best for us.\nWhat we ask for isn\u2019t always what\u2019s best for us at the moment or at all. That girl that you want for a wife may not be the best decision. That dream job you\u2019ve been waiting for may just be a nightmare.\nAt times, what appears to be greener on the other side may be so green after all. Sometimes the grass on the other is hiding bad roots. Sometimes the grass is hiding patches.\nPeople often say God speaks in mysterious ways but those who say this may just have a hard time listening. I would argue the way that God speaks isn\u2019t mysterious at all but rather simple, we just have to be present.\nInstead of repeatedly making attempts to be heard, we should be listening to what God has to say. A lot our prayers that we think go unanswered can simply be attributed to our unwillingness to be silent.\nHow can you hear what someone has to say if they can\u2019t get a word in?\nIf we just listen to God we will be able to hear what he to say and find out that he always answers prayers we just weren\u2019t quite enough to receive the message.\nBut listening is more than just being quiet, listening is about being present.\nEver went to go hear someone speak and after the event was over you can barely recall what they said?\nOne reason is our attention span and the fact that we simply can\u2019t retain all that information. However, the main reason we are unable to comprehend the information given to us is that we weren\u2019t present.\nWhen you are present you give your undivided attention to whoever or whatever is in your presence at that very moment. Many us think that being present is only physical when in fact it\u2019s very much psychological.\nSo how do we become present?\nMeditation.\nWhen you meditate clear out all outside and thoughts you have running around in your head to make room to hear what you need to hear; God\u2019s voice.\nWhen we ask God for something we shouldn\u2019t expect to get it right away; God doesn\u2019t give us what we want right away. He\u2019s not a same day delivery kind of God.\nHe wants us to wait. He wants us to put our faith into practice by trusting that he will do what we asked. A big part of waiting is trusting that something will happen in the near future.\nBy making us wait God is teaching us to trust that he will eventually do what he promised he would.\nNot only is he trying to teach us to trust him he is trying to teach us to learn patiently\nWhat does this mean?\nAfter we have made our requests we shouldn\u2019t just wait we should be patient in our waiting.\nThere\u2019s a difference between simply waiting and waiting patiently.\nTo wait is simply to stay in place in expectation of something. We do it all the time on the phone with customer service, in lines, and at red lights. It seems like most of our day is taken up by waiting but we just can\u2019t stand it.\nSo what do we do?\nWe fix the waiting problem by speeding things up. Just about every day, there\u2019s a new technology that promises to cut down wait times at work, cook food faster, or make your mobile device faster. The problem is when we do things faster we get less quality.\nThe things in life worth having don\u2019t come easy nor do they come quick. They require patience. They require steadfastness. They require waiting without complaint.\nIf you wanted your suit to be the perfect fit you wouldn\u2019t rush your tailor would you? You would want him or her to take their time. You would keep coming back for fitting after fitting until they got the job done just the way you like it if not better.\nWhen God is preparing our blessing he is doing the same thing. He takes what we ask and tailors it just for us to make sure that we get exactly what we wanted if not better than what we originally asked for.\nGod always answers prayers even when the answer is no. Sometimes we don\u2019t get what we want because God wants us to be independent.\nInstead of using God as a crutch he wants to know if we still have faith even when he doesn\u2019t give us what we ask of Him. And sometimes we don\u2019t get what we want because what we may think is good for us really isn\u2019t.\nBut what about those times when I don\u2019t hear God? What about those times when he simply says nothing at all and my prayer goes unanswered?\nIt\u2019s not that he didn\u2019t answer it\u2019s a matter of were you listening. A lot of us feel as though our prayers go unheard because we don\u2019t take the time to listen to what he says. We don\u2019t spend enough time in meditation just being present and listening for his voice.\nWe think God will bless us in a mysterious and miraculous way when really it could be much easier if we just take the time to be present.\nOk, but what if it takes a really long time for him to respond?\nWait. Be patient.\nGod isn\u2019t our bellhop, he doesn\u2019t come running when we call. He wants us to wait. He wants us to practice our faith by trusting in him to provide what it is that we have asked for. Not only that he wants us to be patient.\nGod wants us not to complain in our waiting but to be steadfast.\nWhy?\nBecause when it comes to our blessings they can\u2019t be rushed. God wants to tailor what he has for us to meet our needs and much more but we have to be patient.\nGod always hears what it is we asked for but sometimes it\u2019s not for our good. But when he does give us what we have asked of Him we have to make sure we are listening and know that what he promised us won\u2019t always come right away.\nThanks for reading.\n", "claps": "3.5K claps", "author": "Isaac Breese", "comments": ["Great article.

She tried different forms of therapy and various medications, but nothing worked \u2014 until 15 years ago, when a therapist introduced her to acceptance and commitment therapy.\nACT (pronounced like \u201cact\u201d) is a relatively new form of therapy centered on accepting that pain and suffering are an inevitable part of life, and using that acceptance to manage negative thoughts and feelings. In addition to anxiety, it\u2019s been used as a treatment for depression, chronic pain, anger, phobias, and a host of other issues.\nIts primary conceit is that instead of trying to control or push away your negative emotions, you should focus on learning to live with them. For some people, more traditional ways of coping with those thoughts and feelings can have the opposite of their intended effect, says Jenna LeJeune, PhD, a therapist and ACT practitioner based in Portland, Oregon: \u201cParadoxically, the more we focus on trying to get rid of painful thoughts or feelings, the more those things become the center of our lives.\u201d\nAlthough ACT has technically been around for over 30 years \u2014 it was developed in the mid-1980s by psychologist Steven Hayes, PhD \u2014 it\u2019s only in the last couple of decades or so that it\u2019s begun to gain traction. Hayes\u2019 book on the topic, Get Out of Your Mind and Into Your Life, was published in 2005.\n\u201cWe\u2019re not trying to make you have more positive thoughts or more rational thoughts. We\u2019re trying to help people have a different relationship to their thoughts.\u201d\nThe research on ACT is still nascent, and sometimes conflicting, but it\u2019s growing. LeJeune estimates that there are over 250 randomized controlled trials of ACT in various contexts. One recent study found that ACT could reduce anxiety and depressive symptoms; a 2017 analysis pointed to evidence that it may be beneficial for the treatment of chronic pain; and a 2013 trial found that ACT decreased maladaptive behaviors in students with learning disorders. A 2009 review concluded that ACT was more effective than control settings (placebo, waiting list, or preexisting treatment) for some problems, though not in cases of anxiety or depression. The same review also found that it wasn\u2019t more effective than more established practices like cognitive behavioral therapy, or CBT. (Although ACT technically falls under the wider umbrella of CBT, it is markedly different from Beck CBT, the mainstream form, which is more focused on helping people correct their unproductive lines of thinking.) Another review from 2013, however, did find preliminary support for ACT as a treatment for anxiety.\nDespite the ambiguity in ACT research, Hurwood, who now works part-time at a virtual call center, says the therapy has had a tremendous impact on her anxiety. \u201cI\u2019m more content and much more easygoing than I was,\u201d she says. \u201cIt\u2019s made a total difference for me in terms of my relationships with people and the way I look at life.\u201d\n\u201cPositive thinking is not going to magically get rid of all of your pain,\u201d says Dr. Russ Harris, author of The Happiness Trap: How to Stop Struggling and Start Living, one of the seminal texts on ACT. \u201cWe don\u2019t learn, at least in Western culture, how to deal effectively with the pain that\u2019s inevitable in life. ACT gives you practical skills for how to drop the struggle with that pain, how to make room for it, and how to let it be there without getting consumed or controlled by it.\u201d\nACT is composed of six core principles to help patients develop psychological flexibility, or the ability to adapt to life\u2019s changing circumstances; with this skill, the thinking goes, you\u2019ll have more mental space to focus on other things.\nThe first principle is something called defusion, which involves accepting your thoughts for what they are \u2014 thoughts \u2014 rather than seeing them as the objective truth. \u201cIn ACT, we don\u2019t care about changing the content of your thoughts,\u201d LeJeune says. \u201cWe\u2019re not trying to make you have more positive thoughts, more rational thoughts, or true thoughts. What we\u2019re trying to do is help people have a different relationship to their thoughts.\u201d\nTake this example: Let\u2019s say you just had a big presentation at work that didn\u2019t go well. You saw a co-worker snicker to another co-worker, and your boss looked less than pleased. Afterward, you might have started ruminating over how terrible you are at your job, or convincing yourself that you were about to get fired. Instead of accepting these things as true or trying to will them away with cheerful thoughts, you would instead see the thoughts for what they are and let them pass. Some ACT-recommended strategies include stripping a thought of its power by singing it to the tune of \u201cHappy Birthday,\u201d or putting it in perspective by adding another layer of distance: \u201cI realize I\u2019m having the thought that I\u2019m terrible at my job and that I\u2019ll probably get fired.\u201d\nLearning to acknowledge her negative thoughts and then let them pass was difficult at first, Hurwood says, but incredibly impactful once she got the hang of it. \u201cThat was a hard thing to learn \u2014 that those emotions will pass and you don\u2019t have to interact with them,\u201d she says. \u201cBut when I learned that, it was like, Oh my god. It changed a lot of things for me.\u201d\nHarris, the ACT pioneer, says the biggest difference between ACT and CBT is that with the former, you\u2019re not challenging your thoughts, getting rid of your thoughts, or trying to discern whether your thoughts are true. \u201cIt\u2019s recognizing that your thoughts are here, and learning how to let them come and go,\u201d he says. \u201cThe question is not whether your thoughts are true or false, but rather whether they\u2019re helpful.\u201d\nACT isn\u2019t without its critics. Some traditional CBT practitioners believe the two forms of therapy aren\u2019t as different as some ACT practitioners suggest. Others don\u2019t think there\u2019s enough evidence yet to support ACT\u2019s benefits.\nDespite the lack of consensus on ACT\u2019s efficacy, practitioners have applied it to a wide range of conditions. ACT is considered what\u2019s known as a transdiagnostic behavior therapy, which means it wasn\u2019t designed for one specific diagnosis, LeJeune says. Although therapists commonly use it for anxiety and depression, they\u2019re also using ACT for people with chronic pain, anger, and phobias. Some even use it to help their patients quit smoking.\nMelissa Kirk, 48, had a fear of driving that consumed her for decades. Kirk, a freelance writer based in Richmond, California, says she unsuccessfully tried several different strategies over the years to conquer her fear. Around 16 years ago, she was working at a publishing company that produced several books on ACT, and she began reading up on it. Eventually, with the help of ACT, Kirk says she learned to separate her fearful thoughts \u2014 like \u201cI will die if I drive\u201d \u2014 from the reality of the situation and finally learned how to drive.\n\u201cIt totally shifted my mindset about discomfort,\u201d she says. \u201cJust the idea that I\u2019m allowed to be uncomfortable or anxious or whatever \u2014 I just use it in my whole approach to life now. It\u2019s part of my nature. And my life is way better now.\u201d\nLeJeune says she often tells people to think of it this way: Let\u2019s say you could choose between a life that is full of meaning but also includes suffering, or a life that is devoid of suffering but lacks meaning. Most people would choose the life of meaning.\n\u201cMost of us have been taught that we are first supposed to focus on getting rid of the suffering part and then eventually we get to living a meaningful life,\u201d she says. \u201cACT sort of flips those.\u201d\n", "claps": "2.4K claps", "author": "Jamie Friedlander", "comments": [], "link": "https://elemental.medium.com/the-new-anxiety-therapy-thats-all-about-accepting-your-fears-2bb03f257a36"}, {"title": "I Want to Thank the Portland Police Department for Not Killing Me", "num_comments": "unspecified", "tags": ["police", "biography", "mental health", "racism", "memoir"], "reading_time": 12, "text": "I didn\u2019t yawn as I stirred beneath the covers and there were no cobwebs for me to wipe from my eyes. I was alert and sharp, and knew that I wouldn\u2019t need any more sleep until the sun descended beneath the horizon almost twenty-four hours from now. It was 3:00 am and still pitch-black outside, but I didn\u2019t mind it one bit. The predawn is my optimal time of the day to think, write, and devour the written word.\nI propped myself up from the bed and went to the bathroom to empty my bladder and scrub my teeth. When I returned to my bedroom, I flipped on my laptop computer and pulled up my favorite site to get the news of the day: The Daily Kos. I kept the bedroom lights off and placed a towel beneath the door behind me so that the glare from the computer would not seep through the bottom crevice and cause the others in the house to stir in their beds. And I didn\u2019t want anyone peeking in through the door to ask why I was up so early. The only thing I wanted to hear besides my breathing was the hum of the electricity that powers my laptop computer.\nOnce of my favorite authors on the news site, Joan Moar \u2014 Joan reports on race and social justice issues that are pressing in our country \u2014 had uploaded a story the previous night. It was trending on the site, as it had been recommended over one-hundred forty times by other members of the Daily Kos community. The title of the piece: Parents\u2019 heartbreak: Cops they called to help their son, killed him# Justice For Osaze.\nOh no. Poor Osaze. I inhaled a deep breath, and braced myself for the impact.\nOsaze Osagie was twenty-nine years old, the son of prominent African immigrants with means, and a student at his local university. He had also been diagnosed with a mental illness, one he\u2019d lived with for the entirety of his life. I read and scrolled. And then I read and scrolled some more, my heart sinking further to the floor as I read more of the details of what happened to this young man. Ozaze\u2019s parent\u2019s, fearing for the health and safety of their son, had frantically called the police to report that he was \u201cmissing and had been acting erratically.\u201d Osaze was in the midst of a full-blown mental health conflagration.\nOsaze lived in an apartment on Old Boalsburg Road at the stage college in Pennsylvania. The police rushed over to Ozaze\u2019s apartment and attempted to serve him with a mental health warrant, which is a document that gives the police the authority to take a mentally disturbed person into temporary custody. According to reports, Osaze responded to the police presence by waving a knife around, and the police responded by drawing their firearms and pulling the triggers until Osaze was dead. After reading about the scholarship that was created in Osagie\u2019s memory, I pushed myself away from the desk. I thought back to that time in 2005 and shivered a bit, and then shook my head from side to side. \u201cMy god. That could have me,\u201d I said, whispering. \u201cThat could have been me.\u201d\n*********\nMy full name is Ezebere Ihenetu, the first and only son of two Nigerian transplants, and I\u2019ve been conscious of my silent battle against mental illness since I was twenty-six years old. In early February, 2005, I escaped through the window of my childhood home at the age of twenty-eight, hopped on the Amtrak train heading for Portland, and was whisked away.\nIn early May, 2005, I had been walking the streets of Portland, Oregon for hours, homeless and aimless, until I checked into a hotel for the night. When the night did fall, I should have been exhausted enough to sleep as soon as I curled up in the bed, but after not having slept for more than 24 hours because of vivid dreams and paranoia, I was wide awake and marching from one side of the hotel room to another, kicking at demons in white walls.\nIt was spring time in Portland and probably seventy-five degrees outside. My mind was scattered and feverish. However, my blood had turned stone cold because of the thing that I\u2019d seen a few hours earlier. I draped a blanket over my shoulders to try and keep warm, but my body temperature kept on dropping. I\u2019d been cold before, but this felt completely different, like the warmth was just being drained out of my system. I repeatedly intoned a prayer as I marched, hoping that these prayers would repel the demons somehow. And yet the more I marched, prayed, and sweated, the more animated and emboldened the demons became. The chorus of evil voices rained down on me like hail in a spring storm, pelting and denting my scattered psyche. I was losing the battle, but I didn\u2019t know what else to do except to keep on marching and praying.\n*******\nIt was nearly dawn when something very large banged against the front door of my motel room, causing me to halt my steps. I turned to face the door.\n\u201cThis is the police department,\u201d said a voice. \u201cOpen up the door. Open the door right now!\u201d This demand for my compliance was immediately followed up with more banging on the door.\nI let out the breath that I was holding, then felt a surge of indignation well up inside of me. \u201cNo!\u201d I screamed. \u201cI will not open that door!\u201d\nThere was a few seconds pause before the bottom half of the door suddenly exploded into four separate pieces. And in came a large boot through the hole that had just been kicked in. That boot was attached to the leg of the cop who\u2019d kicked in the door, a large man with a thick mustache who was dressed in a black jacket and pants. Another police officer, who was also clad in all black and wearing a cap, stepped in front of the mustached cop. His weapon was drawn and pointed at my face.\n\u201cGet down on the floor! Get down on the fucking floor,\u201d growled the officer.\n\u201cNo!\u201d I screamed again. My heart was pounding. \u201cYou\u2019re don\u2019t have any right to come in here!\u201d\nThe growling officer took another few steps forward. As he approached the weapon that he was carrying came into sharp focus. I shrank backwards at what looked like a firearm, then turned away from the officer to avoid the bullet in case he decided to shoot. The blanket fell from my shoulders as I made my move. As soon as my back was turned, I experienced a burning pain the likes of which I\u2019d never felt in the rhomboid area of my back. It only took a second for the burning to shoot through to every other muscle in my body like a current, and I was suddenly frozen in place. My legs crumpled beneath me and l collapsed onto the floor.\nWhen I finally stopped trembling the policemen quickly pounced. They pinned my arms behind my back and placed metal handcuffs around both of my wrists. After my arms and wrists were secured, someone grabbed my ankles and folded both of my legs back at the knee. I felt gloved hands press my ankles together and wrap a zip tie just above them. The police were not gentle as they went about their work.\nThe shot to the back of my shoulder temporarily pulled me out of my fever. It stopped raining abusive voices and the ghosts in the wall disappeared. I was anxious to perform a quick self-check of my body just to make sure that I was not bleeding out onto the carpet, but I was unable to raise my head from the floor to see. So I decided to perform a tactile assessment of my physical condition. After a minute of doing this I exhaled in relief. A significant amount of my blood was not pooling on some spot of the carpet.\nThat section of my rhomboid was still burning though. The rhomboid pain was compounded by the pain that now inflamed my shoulders and my wrists. My shoulders were not used to being fixed in this position for this long, and whomever placed these handcuffs on my wrist made them too tight. One of the cops proceeded to pull my pants halfway down my derriere to see if I was hiding contraband in that area of my body. When he was done scanning and found nothing, he didn\u2019t immediately pull my pants back up to their original position. My face became flush from the humiliation. Still, I made the decision not to complain about the treatment that I was receiving. I did not want to give the cops any more reason to rough me up.\nThe cops spend what feels like hours searching through my bags for any kind of contraband. They\u2019re silent as they do this. Too silent. With each minute that I was laying prone on that hard carpet, my burning back and the back of my head in their sights, fear of an eventual catastrophe became all encompassing. Fuck. Are they going to shoot me in the back? Fuck!\nThe officers came away with nothing. And of course they didn\u2019t find anything because I never was a criminal or a habitual drug user. Like Osaze, and other extreme sensitives, I was born into an educated and respectful familial unit who cared about my welfare. My problems were not simply a byproduct of the bad choices that I\u2019ve made in my life. It was the confluence of being repeatedly exposed to suboptimal environments over time \u2014 I was threatened with a knife by an individual the day before \u2014 and a mental imbalance that made sicker than I\u2019ve ever been.\nThe two officers finally grabbed me by the arms and pulled me to my feet. I said a silent prayer this time, for never in my life had I been so relieved to be standing upright. As they prepared to march me out of the hotel room in cuffs, I noticed that the cop who shot me with the taser was grinning as he flips through the pages of one of the books that I\u2019d been carrying with me.\n\u201cYou should really come take a look at this,\u201d he said. \u201cThere is some really good stuff in here. I should take this home with me and use it on my wife.\u201d\nThe cop with the mustache saddled over to where the lead cop was standing to take a peek. The lead cop passed him the book. The mustached police officer\u2019s shoulders shook as he giggled. These guys really knew how to dig their heels in.\nThe mustached police officer looked up from the book and said, \u201cDid you see how I kicked that door in. I fucking smashed that door to pieces.\u201d\nSigh.\nThey marched me out onto the asphalt with no shoes on. I stepped gingerly as they proceeded with ushering me in the direction of the police cruiser. The mustached cop was standing behind me as I leaned against the cruiser. \u201cDo you want me to loosen those handcuffs for you,\u201d he asked.\nThe cuffs were so tight. \u201cYes,\u201d I said through a whisper.\nHe reached down to adjust the handcuff\u2019s grip. I heard something click behind me and I winced, which prompted another chuckle from the guy. Once again I didn\u2019t dare utter a complaint. For I was black and barefoot, surrounded by imposing law enforcement officers who were armed with guns, tasers, and clubs; alone in a city with whom I was in no way familiar. I might as well have been in another country. The mustached police officer stepped in front of me to open the rear door of the cruiser.\nI was taxied over to the local psychiatric ward and deposited into a spare room for an intake session. From the chair in which I was sitting, I saw the mild sadist leaning against the door, keeping a keen eye on the pathetic young man in the chair. I was grateful to be alive and generally intact and felt compelled to express my gratitude to him. \u201cThank you so much,\u201d I said. \u201cThank you. Thank you. Thank you.\u201d\n********\nI turned forty-two this past December. Every morning I look in the mirror and I see the signs of aging gradually accumulate. More gray hairs are sprouting from the bottom of my chin, my hairline is retreating to the back of my head, the metal implants in my knees are probably rusting, the groves in my stomach have morphed into a paunch, and my lower back could go out at any minute. My mind isn\u2019t as sharp as it used to be either. Growing older is hard on a man. But unlike Osaze, who was gunned down at about the same age that I was picked up in Portland, I\u2019m at least able to look back at the past, learn from it, and look forward to the future.\nFourteen years have gone by since I was released from the psychiatric ward in Portland. In that time I\u2019ve obtained employment at the Mental Health Center of Denver as a peer worker for other sensitives like me. I taught elementary school for two years after that, graduated with honors from the master\u2019s degree program at the local university, worked at the local respiratory hospital for five years straight \u2014 my longest tenure at any company, cultivated friendships that I\u2019m confident are going to last forever, attended my sister\u2019s law school graduation, and I\u2019m making a few dollars as a writer too.\nI was with my father as he battled cancer and kidney disease over the span of a year. I was in the hospital room as he cried out, \u201cI love you Eze!\u201d after he realized that he was not going to be able to defeat cancer for a second time. And I delivered my father\u2019s eulogy in front of dozens of mourners after he passed away from cancer and renal failure in the winter of 2013.\nI am the only son of Nigerian immigrants, the first of my family to be born in the United States of America. The significance of my existence cannot be understated. Do you know how pivotal it was for me to be able to speak at my father\u2019s funeral? What would have looked like if his only son was absent from the funeral proceedings. What would happen if there was no remaining male survivor on my father\u2019s side of the extended Ihenetu family? The amount of heartbreak in that moment would have been amplified to a point that I cannot conceive.\n********\nThe policemen probably didn\u2019t see any potential when they were stuffing the barefoot and harried black stranger into the back of the squad car fourteen years ago, which makes their decision to spare me from the fate that was imposed upon Osaze, and on the other untold number of black African and American men in the country, that much more noteworthy. They encountered me when I was an imminent danger to my own well-being and a danger to the Portland community. Now couple that with the fact that I hadn\u2019t immediately complied with their commands after they\u2019d announced their presence. Those cops could have just shot me dead. When asked to justify their reasoning for the aftermath, they could have cited my inability to comply with their commands as a justification for plugging me with bullets. Everyone would have taken their word for it and moved on to the next moments of their lives.\nSo many young black mentally ill men have been cut down by the police before they\u2019ve had the chance to realize their own potential. Osaze was studying at Penn State and had established roots in the community. He was very well regarded by all of the people who had come to know him. \u201cHe was a man of peace who loved everybody\u201d they said. It\u2019s beyond tragic that this young man wasn\u2019t allowed the opportunity to thrive someday.\nWhen I come across the stories like Osaze\u2019s, I am ruined for the rest of the day. It\u2019 virtually impossible for me to concentrate on anything substantive, as I am forced to wrestle with an acute case of survivor\u2019s remorse. Eventually, that remorse and guilt that I struggle with will be replaced with relief and gratitude because I was granted the extra chance to live a life that may be worthy of remembrance one day. So I want to offer a thank you to the cops who chose to subdue me with a modicum of unnecessary force and a taser instead of stopping me forever with a gun.\nMy two sisters thank you and my momma thanks you too.\nYou can read more about Osaze here: https://radio.wpsu.org/post/hundreds-attend-funeral-osaze-osagie-who-was-fatally-shot-state-college-police-0\n", "claps": "1.3K claps", "author": "Eze Ihenetu", "comments": [], "link": "https://medium.com/@ep2ihenetu/i-want-to-thank-the-portland-police-department-for-not-killing-me-7bfde1e040b3"}, {"title": "Strategies for Self-Care That Really Work \u2013 Elemental", "num_comments": "unspecified", "tags": [], "reading_time": 5, "text": "The term \u201cself-care,\u201d once found mostly in the revolutionary texts of writers like Audre Lorde (who described it as \u201can act of political warfare\u201d) and the reference materials for psychiatrists in training, is now ubiquitous in...\n", "claps": "1.2K", "author": "Katie Fustich", "comments": [], "link": "https://elemental.medium.com/strategies-for-self-care-that-really-work-1b3d6ca514a"}, {"title": "This Is What Happens When I Try to Wear a Dress... \u2013 Lit Up \u2013 Medium", "num_comments": 3, "tags": ["life", "fiction", "short story", "writing", "fashion"], "reading_time": 2, "text": "N and I sit on the couch.

It\u2019s comfortable, considerably cheaper than a decent suit, and is durable for those sloppy nights out.

Of the 12,000 reviews that consumer group Which? analyzed, 87% were from unverified purchases! Sellers are gaming the system to get on top and while Amazon claims to have the automated technology to weed these reviews out, the fact remains that marketplaces, especially at the scale of Amazon\u2019s are vulnerable to having their systems gamed. New brands will have it especially hard to come on top.\nDid you know that 2.5 million quintillion bytes of data are generated every single day? Data is currency and brands need to actively be front and centre in its creation, its management and its deployment. When brands sell on Amazon, however, they don\u2019t have access to wholesome customer data. In fact, Amazon started giving out data through an analytics dashboard only two months ago and even the data covered in the dashboard doesn\u2019t give a complete picture. As a result, they do not have a comprehensive understanding of their customers. This grasp of who their customer is and what each segment is purchasing is crucial for brands and has a direct impact on their production as well as the brand\u2019s roadmap for the future. How do you decide what to make if you don\u2019t know what your customers are buying?\nToday\u2019s customer isn\u2019t looking for products as much as she is looking for experiences. Did you know that 41% of customers are willing to let go of a brand because of poor customer experience? When a brand sells on Amazon, they are losing their customer relationship to the platform and consequently, they lose the opportunity to become memorable to their customer. On the other hand, brands that sell through their own channels have complete control over their customer\u2019s experience and can customize it to their customers\u2019 preferences.\nAmazon\u2019s customers are Amazon\u2019s customers. Brands must be cognizant of this. Selling on Amazon makes it impossible for brands to craft their own identity and stand apart from the sea of brands and sellers who already occupy the e-commerce behemoth\u2019s platform. Selling on Amazon might make sense as a distribution strategy, but it will never be a sustainable way to acquire customer loyalty and following. With new sellers added on the platform every day, discoverability becomes incredibly difficult and competitive, especially for newer brands. Additionally, the ease of setting up on Amazon enables the rise of fake goods, which can destroy the brands\u2019 hard-earned reputation.\nFor brands that are starting out, selling on Amazon might seem like an easy way of breaking into the market. The effortless set-up and the established audience that runs into the hundreds of millions shouldn\u2019t lure brands away from thinking about their long-term future for which they will need control and growth.\nAnd Amazon will give them neither.\n", "claps": "261 claps", "author": "Lavanya Mohan", "comments": [], "link": "https://medium.com/@lavsmohan/what-fashion-brands-need-to-know-before-selling-on-amazon-1ba4f039e5b0"}, {"title": "How we can celebrate The Earth day everyday and make our fashion shopping more green and...", "num_comments": "unspecified", "tags": ["fashion trends", "earth day", "green", "sustainability", "fashion"], "reading_time": 4, "text": "April 22 is a special date. More than a billion people, scattered all over the world, are celebrating the International Earth Day. Because they love their world and want to keep it green, happy and free.\nDo you know that in the fashion world you can find hundreds of organic, nature-friendly or recycled fabrics? There is a huge variety of materials and models for both men and women as well as for the youngest, not to forget the sports and the extreme natured people. These are the clothes and accessories that are much more than a fashion hit or the trend of the season, they are a conscious choice and we have a major part in this choice. This is a choice taken with love and care for the planet. In order to leave something creative behind us, we must also give \u2014 our time and attention, our care and our love. Today we celebrate Earth Day. Day as any other day, but filled with even more excitement when we can help our planet to be green and healthy for our future generations.\nAnd to celebrate the feast of our beautiful Earth together, let me introduce you to some of the interesting fabrics you can find in stores or the internet just a click away, but reading the labels there is a chance you not to be aware that they are sustainable or recycled. I will introduce you to fabrics that come from sustainable or recycled materials and will make you look at your wardrobe with different eyes.\nHere are some of the fabrics that not only bring sustainability in business but beauty and green attitude towards our planet. And I bet you never thought that they make you be so close to nature.\nOrganic cotton\nOrganic cotton is comfortable to wear just like the rest of the cotton, but growing significantly more inventive and it is super-durable. Bio cotton is sown on clean, non-chemical soil. Goodbye, pesticides and chemical fertilisers! Its seeds should be certified not GMOs. Seeds should not be touched by toxic substances. And the finished crop is harvested entirely by natural methods \u2014 meaning by hand. The most popular fabric among those who care for nature! When investing in organic cotton clothes, we know that we invest in items that save nature, emissions, water and electricity.\nLyocell (and Tencel \u2014 light and versatile fabric made from Lyocell)\nLyocell is a fibre that is extracted from wood pulp and forms an extremely impressive material \u2014 100% biodegradable, soft, not crushed and last, but not least \u2014 durable material. Lyocell is harvested in sustainable, nature-friendly farms by dissolving wood pulp from eucalyptus plantations. Material is defined as finer than silk and cooler than flax, its fibres are moisture absorbent, antibacterial, biodegradable and do not irritate the skin. And... it\u2019s cheaper than most luxurious fabrics \u2014 silk and cashmere wool.\nRayon (the silk alternatives)\nViscose rayon is blend of natural and synthetic resources, obtained from the wood pulp from different trees. Though Rayon is derived from natural materials, it requires certain chemicals, so it\u2019s considered to be a semi-synthetic fabric. Rayon fibre has high tenacity and high wet modulus. The chemical characteristics of rayon are similar to cotton and it provides soft, smooth and comfortable handle, while its drape and fall simulate properties similar to nylon. Further, the higher moisture absorption and the non-body clinging nature make it ideal for use in hot and humid weather.\nModal\nModal is semi synthetic material and it is wood pulp based cellulosic fibre, made out of pure wooden chips from the beech tree or from algae. Modal uses only beech wood, thus it is essentially a variety of viscose rayon, which can be obtained from the wood pulp from a number of different trees. That\u2019s how modern technology combines with natural materials and gives us a great product. The modal is soft, durable, hypoallergenic and excellent for the creation of sportswear and accessories.\nPolylana\nPolylana is made from 100% recycled textiles. Polylana\u00ae fiber is the only low impact alternative to 100% acrylic and wool in the market. Polylana\u00ae fibre delivers quality, value, and a great low-impact story almost against similar cost. It is a patent pending staple fibre composed of a proprietary blend of innovative modified polyester pellets and modified rPET chips. All its qualities allows Polylana fibre to be dyed at low temperature, and gives its yarn, when knitted, a unique loft and feel.\nRecycled polyester\nRecycled polyester is a synthetic material made from recycled materials such as plastic bottles and textile residues. It stands out with great functionality and robustness. It resembles traditional polyester, but is more environmentally friendly as a production process. Recycled Polyester is produced from raw material waste, which would otherwise go to a landfill. There are two different categories of recycled polyester: post-industrial and post-consumer. Post-consumer waste is recovered from the consumer supply chain, primarily from beverage bottles, which are recycled and then ground and processed as a polyester staple fibre feedstock.\nPost-industrial waste is generated during the manufacturing process of upstream polyester and plastic products. This can be from virgin fibre producers, tire cord manufacturers, polymerisation plants, and many other plastic products.\nRecycled polyester fibre launched the polyester industry into a more environmentally friendly future. More and more fashion producers add to their label the recycled polyester material, helping not only to reduce the plastic waste, but also helping the fashion industry to be more sustainable and environmentally friendly.\nBy listing those sustainable materials in the fashion industry, I do not only try to make you think green, but I also try to make you read your labels when fashion shopping. I am not saying \u201cthink twice before you buy\u201d, I am saying, be educated, be aware and don\u2019t be scared of fabrics holding names that sound synthetic.\nIf not us, no one else will make a difference for our planet Earth\u2019s wellbeing.\nWe are the one held responsible for our actions and our children\u2019s future.\nToday is the International Earth Day, let\u2019s celebrate it every day by being sustainable and fashionable.\n", "claps": "6 claps", "author": "Gloria Stoilova", "comments": [], "link": "https://medium.com/@gloria.stoilova/how-we-can-celebrate-the-earth-day-everyday-and-make-our-fashion-shopping-more-green-and-e1dd153d80a4"}, {"title": "Food is Medicine. And It\u2019s Toxic. Why Would You Choose to Eat Poison?", "num_comments": 12, "tags": ["health", "food", "wellness", "diet", "fitness"], "reading_time": 12, "text": "Long before there were Cheetos, Oreos and Ritz Crackers, and processed meats were identified as some of the worst possible foods, we ate what we could grow or forage. The advent of the American snack food industry was two centuries ago, although I might posit that any handful of berries or a ripe apple is just as much a snack, and vastly better.\nAnd yes, we know that. We got that. We\u2019re tired of hearing that.\nHand me the donuts, please. My hand is up. They are very hard to resist. That\u2019s how they\u2019re designed. Many of us battle with this every single day.\nI used to think it was just about the calories. Many still do, and that includes too many nutritionists and many more health care folks. And they are wrong. Please see Dr. Jason Fung\u2019s fine Medium piece here.\nFor one, too many of us use our Fitbits as an excuse to gorm a pizza based on calories alone. And, using a calorie as a measure doesn\u2019t take into account the value of the food to our bodies. Even then, I could chow down on a granola or a KIND bar thinking (incorrectly) that I\u2019ve just given myself a nice boost. Yeah. To my butt. Because there\u2019s little difference between those so-called good foods and a Snickers bar, which, frankly, tastes a whole lot better. If you\u2019re going to do damage, hell, at least have fun.\nFor example, pundits, politicians and professional healthcare folks have pounded us about salt (incorrectly, as it turns out, although pouring a cupful down your throat may not be such a good idea). Any farmer or horse owner who really loves his animals puts out a salt block. In fact, animals will walk a very long way to get salt, because the body needs it. We do too.\nShow me a farmer or a horse breeder who puts out an entire solid sugar block. The occasional cube, yes. But a block? They\u2019d be blockheads.\nAnd about those fries, or that sushi or that soy sauce? That pepperoni?\nIt has more to do with the extreme high heat necessary to cook those fries, or make those great-tasting lunch meats.\nThis article outlines a number of bad foods, but perpetuates the lie about salt. It\u2019s the kind of thing that doctor and author Ken D. Berry writes in his book Lies My Doctor Told Me. Someone does some questionable research, said research is picked up swiftly by a headline-loving media, then it evolves into gospel without the slightest challenge. Berry refers to those as medical lies. We\u2019re still being told not to eat salt.\nSalt isn\u2019t the issue. More so sugar. And, the Butylated Hydroxytoluene (BHT) or BHA (Butylated Hydroxyanisole) that many of our popular cereals contain. Those are thought to be carcinogens, and are widely banned by other rich countries. Why are we eating them? Why would parents who (and I heartily disagree with this) virulently fight against vaccines, might turn around and feed their kids processed meats that contain advanced glycation end products (AGEs): inflammatory compounds that are created when these processed meats are dried, smoked, and cooked at high temperatures.\nJust because a sweet cartoon character on a cereral box insinuates himself into our consciousness or a manly man hoists a container of (largely useless and even dangerous) protein powders doesn\u2019t make those products friendly to us. It makes money for the producer, and often makes us sick, which makes money for the predatory medical system, insurance companies and hospitals with shareholders.\nThe body is geared to like sweet foods, the taste of fat and salt- because we need them. In their natural states. What we don\u2019t need are the pesticides, the additives, and all those chemicals that make certain foods more convenient because they are kept from rotting. The problem is that a lot of the stuff that keeps certain foods from rot may well rot us from the inside out.\nSalt, as a preservative, as a spice, still works.\nBesides: too little salt? Not only does our food taste like crap, here\u2019s what else happens:\nAnd low-salt diets could have side effects: when salt intake is cut, the body responds by releasing renin and aldosterone, an enzyme and a hormone, respectively, that increase blood pressure.(emphasis added).\nAnother article, although it too, perpetuating the lie about sodium intake, speaks to a great overall concern about food. It\u2019s not so much what we do eat, which is what we most often discuss, it\u2019s more so what we don\u2019t. Fiber, which is far better for us than any probiotic supplement, is missing in most all of our diets.\nWhen we had to forage, the body had to wait until we could find or grow or catch or kill a source of nourishment. This is just one reason that there is a faddish fascination with fasting, as it has significant health benefits. Foods are seasonal for a reason. You and I, as Northern Americans, aren\u2019t intended to be eating nectarines in the dead of winter. I have to wonder if the environmental costs of shipping and transport truly worth it any more.\nNow while you and I don\u2019t necessarily have to consume eleven Indonesian wicker baskets before breakfast to get our daily fiber content, there is a strong argument for trading expensive supplements for the real thing. In most cases we take too many, and most are so full of fillers that they actually endangered folks with allergies. Utah\u2019s retired Senator Orrin Hatch virtually guaranteed a completely unregulated industry --which, by the way, paid him off handsomely for the courtesy \u2014 and loosed billions of bottles of bullshit upon us all. Caveat emptor. Don\u2019t assume your government is here to help you when it comes to either the Food Pyramid (influenced by huge farm lobbies) or supplements, thank you. Hatch\u2019s son, is of course, in the business. Of course he is. Orrin himself got his start in the business, shilling shit in a capsule to unsuspecting old folks. Now that same crap is in GNC, Walgreen\u2019s and likely, your own kitchen cabinet.\nDown the hatch all right. Billions upon billions down the hatch of the murderous Hatch family. For excellent advice on supplements and in fact, which can do serious harm, go here.\nEven if we do eat what might be traditionally fiber-rich foods, that may no longer be enough. We are getting a fraction of the fiber that our near-ancestors consumed.\nThis change isn\u2019t just attributable to the advent of fiber-free processed and fast foods in advanced economies. More than 10,000 years ago, before agriculture and selective plant breeding, early fruits and vegetables were almost unrecognizable by today\u2019s standards.\nGeneration after generation of farmers have since bred them to be bigger and tastier \u2014 in many cases increasing their sugar content and stripping them of fiber. Milling, meanwhile, cleared the whole-grain fractions out of our bread and bakery products, which were a major fiber source, Walter said. And meat replaced fibrous beans and lentils as the main source of protein in many parts of the world. Researchers are now documenting the health impacts of that change.\nI have been appalled at the American arrogance about \u201cpretty food.\u201d I once showed a photo of a twisted carrot to a women who exclaimed with disgust that \u201cI wouldn\u2019t eat THAT.\u201d Well, honey, I can introduce you to billions the world over who would be damned grateful for one single ugly carrot. The ones we have are so overbred, so beyond what Nature might have intended.\nWe don\u2019t want to be inconvenienced by seeds in our grapes and watermelons. I for one, miss the hell out of those seeds. Nature does not make a better projectile with which to pelt one\u2019s older brother than watermelon seeds, spat at warp speed by a hightailing sister. Farmers took all the damned fun out of my favorite summer fruit. Not just the fun, but the too much of the nutritional value.\nThe rich, sweet flavor that marked the carrots and tomatoes of my youth on the farm have been replaced by pretty, pithy and tasteless products. As anyone over fifty about the long-ago wonder of a steak tomato, so good that you\u2019d slap slices of that bad boy into a sandwich with mayo and you\u2019re in heaven.\nThey no longer exist, at least in those countries that use single crop mass production. Pesticides. Where insects no longer thrive. Where even the soil is now toxic. Places where water is so scarce because corporations like Coke buy up the supplies, toxic soda is cheaper than water.\nI was driving south on I-75 from Tampa to Naples when the overloaded truck in front of me lost a few fruit from its load. I though they were limes.\nNope. Tomatoes. Hard, like rocks, not even breaking upon landing on asphalt at 75 mph.\nThat\u2019s not food. That\u2019s filler. A very pretty package in the supermarket with almost nothing for nutritional value. No wonder we\u2019re sick, when so much of what we might once have been able to count on as food has been fiddled with to the point that it\u2019s barely water with a skin around it.\nAnd, as you probably know already, organic doesn\u2019t mean much any more, except that you and I likely paid a very high price. The standards have such large loopholes that big producers drive their semis and profits right through them. And we still get pesticides. Here\u2019s a way to think about it and possibly protect yourself.\nThe point of food isn\u2019t just to shut down the growling in your stomach. Nor is it solely to show how much money you have by wasting thousands on gold-covered ice cream in Dubai.\nYah. Gold is a mineral for us like a potato chip is a vegetable. Like beer is a whole grain food. Like...well, you get the message.\nWe can laugh ourselves into oblivion with such ridiculous excuses. That said, how can any of us navigate the minefield that is our food choice spectrum and the unique demands of our bodies, mine, yours, everyone else\u2019s?\nSuch as, if I feel sorry for myself, I have been known to stuff eight chocolate covered Krispy Kremes into my gullet because of the emotional pain. I am quite sure nobody else has ever done this. Of course not. I swear, the bad snack food industry would collapse if we were all sublimely happy.\nThe great Buddhist monk That Nich Hanh wrote that when we identify the source of our suffering, it can set us free. By this he meant that when we see that there are things we do that make us suffer, we can stop. If there are things we ingest that make us suffer, we can stop. There\u2019s more, but I\u2019ll stop there because I suffer to consider how many things I do which create suffering. As in:\nPart of the problem, and I suffer from it like everyone else on the planet, is that when something tastes good, we want more of it. One piece of Cadbuy\u2019s turns into the whole damned bar, particularly if it\u2019s been a hard day. My body rewards me with cramps, sickness and a horrific thick feeling. I know it\u2019s coming and I damned well do it anyway. As do we all at one time or another (kindly, consider, tequila.)\nThis is my fundamental issue with my arch enemy, the Brussels Sprout. Yeccch. I would rather eat breaded cardboard. This is also precisely what Big Food knows that we crave: sweet, salt, fat, because we are wired for them for survival. In their natural forms. Ugly or not. That\u2019s why their highly-trained food chemists manipulate their products to make them ever so much more tasty and addictive.\nPure shit like Cheetos and Oreos and all the other chemical-laden, toxic crap that overwhelms most of the middle of every grocery store (and increasingly, the rest of the world\u2019s stores and shops) are often what we turn to when we are anxious, and are often the cause of even greater anxiety.\nIn this Medium piece by Ruth Henderson, this passage gets to the heart of it:\nAs I unloaded the details of the past few weeks to one of my closest friends, he said, \u201cWow Ruth, what a sh*tty summer. And also, I think you should go to Dairy Queen and have a huge Blizzard and eat all the toppings possible.\u201d\nWe so often turn to what we euphemistically refer to as \u201ccomfort food\u201d which is anything but. That food all too often, as Henderson writes, results in\n... negative physical responses for me, including inflammation, migraines, joint pain, thyroid issues, and, in many ways worst of all, anxiety.\nKey to her comment, is \u201cfor me.\u201d Aye, there\u2019s the rub.\nIf you and I are trying to lose a pound here and there, and we grind through three bags of Chips Ahoy because we crave comfort, not only do we get sick as shit, we now feel like shit because we know what we did to our poor beleaguered bodies. Double whammy.\nThis New York Times piece discusses the connection between food and anxiety further. While I do not in any way ascribe to meds \u2014 with the exception of those who have extreme mental health issues \u2014 I do believe that the right foods eaten with joy and pleasure can go a very long way towards helping what ails us.\nIn all these arguments about food, nutrition (eggs are good, eggs are evil) and the ongoing ridiculousness that are national good guidelines, there is but one final truth:\nIt\u2019s all about what works for you. Literally and figuratively speaking, what does your gut tell you? What does your body tell you? What and whom do you trust? For my part, farmer\u2019s markets, where I can find them. Green grocers, where I can find them. If I\u2019m fortunate, perhaps where I land next, I can grow my own. But I won\u2019t buy any seeds from Monsanto, the world\u2019s Darth Vader. While this article might be a bit hyperbolic, it does speak to many of the fundamental issues of this massively evil food giant.\nMy final salvo: Almond Milk. Sugar water with a smattering of crushed almonds. If you\u2019ll buy that bullshit as healthy, you\u2019ll buy anything. Big Food is counting on it. I\u2019m sticking with water that I have filtered myself. At least I know what the hell is in it. As for the rest? Listen to your body. Not your tongue. Not the ads. Not the messaging. And that, finally...\nI grew up on a farm. Part of a dying breed. I grew up with rich soil, dense nutrients in my foods, sweet carrots and hearty potatoes that didn\u2019t need irradiating. I don\u2019t know where we go from here. But for my part, I don\u2019t trust anything with a label or the promise of a better food through chemistry or fiddling by food scientists.\nWho do you listen to? Who can you trust? I like reading Markham Heid. He does his research. I read voraciously, and take everything I read with a rather large block of (perfectly good) salt. I read materials from folks who are NOT funded by Nestle or Coca Cola or Monsanto any other Big Food. There is nothing about packaged food that is healthy enough to dump fresh water for Fresca, or toss out your turnips for Taco Bell.\nUltimately, if you are going to live well, you have to listen to the only wise voice you and I have: our bodies. Do the research. Understand what your unique body needs, and how those changes shift each decade, through sickness and health and injury and aging. We are our own best doctors, but we must do the research, and find nutritionists we trust.\n", "claps": "1K claps", "author": "Julia E Hubbel", "comments": ["Another great essay!

The Health Diaries is a weekly series about the habits that keep notable people living well.\nThe first thing James Quarles wants you to know is that he\u2019s both a CEO and a family man. Quarles has been at San Francisco-based Strava, the social networking website for athletes, since May 2017. He leads 175 employees, who work in offices around the world to help turn Strava into a community-focused tool for bringing people together. According to recent data from Strava, the app adds 1 million new users every 30 days.\nQuarles loves his work, but he\u2019s also deeply committed to his other job: being a dad to three kids. His wife also works a busy job that involves a lot of travel, and Quarles says they\u2019ve committed to sharing the parenting load 50\u201350, which means he\u2019s become obsessed with life hacks and efficiency tricks for parents.\nQuarles shares with Elemental his varied schedule, his love of avocados, and the reasons why he doesn\u2019t work on evenings or weekends.\nMy alarm is set for 6 a.m. but I tend to wake up around 5:45 a.m. most mornings. Then I lace up my shoes, grab a headlamp, and head out for a run. I do a 5-mile run around my neighborhood several times per week, with headphones in because I listen to podcasts. If I don\u2019t run, I\u2019ll hop in the shower and get myself ready right away. On the weekends, I still run every morning \u2014 but the only difference is that my runs are longer. And this is a great life hack: I take my two boys on my weekend runs and they pace-set me on their bikes.\nOn weekdays, my kids wake up at 6:30 a.m. I help them get dressed, I make breakfast, and I help with any homework that didn\u2019t get done the night before. I have three kids ages 9, 7, and 4 (boy, boy, girl), and my wife and I have careers, both of which involve travel. There\u2019s quite a bit of circus on the home front that\u2019s shared between my wife and me in a strong partnership.\nBreakfast is something nutritious and healthy, usually an avocado-banana-peanut butter variation on a smoothie. I add flax, maca, and chia in my smoothies. We try to avoid sugar and keep processed foods out of our diet, so our family breakfasts are often egg and avocado-based meals, like omelettes, breakfast burritos, or avocado on English muffins. We get the kids to eat as many avocados as we can stuff in them.\nBy 7:30 a.m., I\u2019m on my way to work. I jump on my bike, ride it to the train station, then put my bike onto the train and ride it into the city. My bike commute is one of the most important habits I have: I ride even when it\u2019s raining (I have great rain pants) and I like breathing in the fresh air. Plus, by the time everybody has their backpacks on and they\u2019re out the door, I\u2019m racing for my train, so it gets my heart rate up. Then I\u2019m at work by 8:30 a.m. and I\u2019d say, on most days, I\u2019m scheduled out until 5:30 p.m. It\u2019s usually a combination of meetings, interviews, and talking with board members.\nThe really nice exception to this schedule rule is Wednesdays, when I have a block of time midday held for the Strava workout of the week. Around 30 to 40 employees meet and we do interval runs together. Yesterday we did 11 minute-long sprints at the pace we\u2019d run if we were completing a 5-kilometer race. Then we grab showers and go back to work. I\u2019ve only missed this workout once since I started at Strava.\nFor lunch, there\u2019s a great place around the corner from my office that makes salads with protein and greens. I usually get salmon, ahi tuna, or chicken on top of a mixed greens salad. For dinner, we found a company in Oakland that does food delivery and we get meals with veggies and protein. Often, the kids like the food so much that they\u2019ll eat it all before we get home! We also have a nanny and she cooks sometimes, too. That gets us through the week. On weekends, I love to cook and it\u2019s usually fish or meat with vegetables from the market.\nAfter work, I catch a 5:58 p.m. train every day and I\u2019m home by about 6:30 p.m. My evenings are everything you\u2019d expect: story time, homework, reading, and trying to get everybody in bed. It\u2019s just changing jobs from my day job to my night job.\nI\u2019m usually in bed by 10 p.m. and probably reading before that. Reading physical paper matters to me. I also take decompression time to talk if there are things on my mind. My wife and I are pretty good about not bringing our phones to bed (we plug them in downstairs) so we can try to be present with the kids and each other.\nMy whole world functions around the quality of my sleep. I wear a rather large smartwatch and I only take it off to recharge it. I use it to track my sleep and look at the quality of it, both the hours and how much deep sleep I\u2019m getting. I also pay attention to sleep hygiene: We have a dark room with no distracting lights and no screens, and I drink lots of water. Those are big priorities for me. And I find ways to clear out what might keep me up mentally by using breathing techniques.\nI believe people who have a lot to juggle tend to be really focused and intentional about every part of their lives. When I\u2019m at work, I want to be fully focused on work. And when I\u2019m home, I don\u2019t let my work bleed over; I want to be intentional about chatting with my kids. Balance is one of Strava\u2019s core values and I really live by it.\nFor me, living a healthy life is about balance, energy, and awareness. By balance, I mean moderation and making sure different aspects of your life don\u2019t disproportionately affect others. Energy involves thinking about what gives me more capacity, like working out, boot camps, running, biking, stretching, and strength training. Energy is also about nutrition. For example, I only drink decaffeinated coffee. I can\u2019t have caffeine; I\u2019m already animated! And if I have caffeine at 10 a.m., it\u2019ll impact my sleep that night.\nStrava is about digitizing what motivates people: You declare your goal and you tell people you\u2019re doing something you care about. That declaration matters. So does healthy competition. I also think it\u2019s great to be recognized when I wake up at 5 a.m. and got my run in before the sun was up. On Strava, people say, \u201cI see you.\u201d That builds a community of people who are with you the whole way.\nIn a study we did, 69% of people said using Strava made them happier. In a world where technology and screens have a negative impact on our overall health and wellness, we see a huge power in this tool, which encourages people to get out and be active together.\n", "claps": "2.3K claps", "author": "Jenni Gritters", "comments": [], "link": "https://elemental.medium.com/why-stravas-ceo-doesn-t-work-evenings-or-weekends-a72093618711"}, {"title": "Why Extreme Wellness Is So Popular \u2013 Elemental", "num_comments": 40, "tags": ["health", "diet", "wellness", "nutrition", "fitness"], "reading_time": 8, "text": "Emily Fonnesbeck says her issues with diet and exercise started after her first son was born. \u201cI was a new mom and feeling pressure to recover from the pregnancy body, and I started eating less and exercising more,\u201d she says. \u201cI\u2019m very much a perfectionist, so if I\u2019m going to do something, I\u2019m going to do it one hundred percent.\u201d\nAt first, 100% meant cardio workouts most days and eliminating unhealthy foods from her diet. But slowly her habits snowballed. Over a period of five or six years, her training progressed until she was working out for at least 90 minutes every day. \u201cThere were numbers I had to hit \u2014 like a certain number of miles, minutes, calories, etc. \u2014 and if I didn\u2019t hit them, my mind would drive me crazy about it all day,\u201d she says.\nMeanwhile, Fonnesbeck was also experimenting with elimination diets. First she cut out sugar, followed by dairy and gluten. \u201cI had constant headaches and I was tired and I had digestive issues,\u201d she says. \u201cI thought, well, I\u2019m just not eating the right things \u2014 I need to cut out what I\u2019m eating that\u2019s bad.\u201d Eventually, her diet dwindled to just five foods: sprouted-corn tortillas, brown rice, cabbage, tahini, and beans.\nFonnesbeck, 37, is a registered dietician and nutrition therapist. She says she should have recognized, based on her own expertise, that her problem was not eating enough. \u201cI had this idea that there was this perfect way of eating and I needed to find it, and that would fix everything,\u201d she says.\nShe realized it all needed to stop when her husband approached her about an upcoming vacation. \u201cI was feeling really overwhelmed about going because it meant I\u2019d have to pack all of my own food and try to figure out how to fit in my workouts,\u201d she says. \u201cMy husband looked at me and said, \u2018Emily, it\u2019s time to get some help.\u2019\u201d\nToday Fonnesbeck works with people who have eating and body-image disorders like the one she had. \u201cA common theme [among clients] is that if you\u2019re not obsessive, then you\u2019re lazy or letting yourself go,\u201d she says. \u201cI think that\u2019s one of the biggest cultural messages \u2014 that it\u2019s all or nothing.\u201d\nPeople like to quote the truism \u201ceverything in moderation,\u201d but they don\u2019t like to follow it. Nearly half of U.S. adults do not exercise enough and most do not eat the recommended amounts of fruits and vegetables. On the other end of the spectrum are people who seek to go well beyond what\u2019s advised for good health. According to Google data, three of the five most-searched-for diets in 2018 involved fasting, reducing or eliminating whole food categories, or a mix of both approaches. \u201cA lot of these popular diets are sensationalized, extreme versions of the truth,\u201d Fonnesbeck says.\nParticipation in marathons and ultramarathons has also increased exponentially during the past three decades. The number of people running marathons worldwide grew 40% from 2008 to 2018. And while the number of people in the U.S. who signed up for long-distance races peaked in 2013, experts say that probably has more to do more with the rise in popularity of CrossFit, spinning, and other forms of vigorous exercise than with people easing their training habits. Meditative practices are similarly becoming more extreme. \u201cEven though we keep adding centers, we cannot keep up with the demand,\u201d says a spokesperson for the New York Vipassana Association when asked about the center\u2019s multi-day silent retreats.\nThese trends suggest that many people in the U.S. are pushing themselves to potentially unhealthy extremes in search of self-improvement. The terms \u201cwellness\u201d and \u201chealth\u201d are often used interchangeably, but they have different connotations. These days it seems wellness means more than having sound physical and mental health; to be truly well, you need also be slim, happy, energetic, attractive, strong, optimistic, present, engaged, and mentally sharp \u2014 and to maintain consistent levels of all these attributes.\nAmid such high expectations, experts say a number of psychological and psychosocial factors help explain the appeal of excessive approaches to wellness. \u201cIn the U.S., we have this keeping-up-with-the-Joneses mentality,\u201d says Hillary Cauthen, a psychologist with the Association for Applied Sport Psychology. \u201cAnd it\u2019s all about showing we\u2019re the best and going hard at everything.\u201d\nWhen the World Happiness Report 2019 was published in March by the United Nations Sustainable Development Solutions Network, it showed that, for the third year in a row, the U.S. had fallen in its rankings. In a paper published in conjunction with the report, Columbia University professor Jeffrey Sachs argues that America\u2019s \u201cmass-addiction society\u201d is a major driver of unhappiness. He cites traditional substance addictions, such as alcohol or opioids. But he also highlights unconventional addictions, including exercise and diet-related compulsions.\n\u201cMy argument is that the U.S. is suffering an epidemic of addictions, and that these addictions are leaving a rising portion of American society unhappy,\u201d he writes.\nMost experts agree that when a person\u2019s wellness pursuits interfere with their job, school, or personal relationships \u2014 or produce feelings like guilt or shame \u2014 then they\u2019re edging toward disorder territory. \u201cIf taking a day off makes you feel bad about yourself, that\u2019s a problem,\u201d says Cauthen.\nIt\u2019s unclear whether levels of disordered eating and exercise are truly on the upswing in the U.S. or if those behaviors are simply more performative today thanks, chiefly, to Instagram. All-or-nothing wellness philosophies now saturate many social media platforms, with users uploading tens of millions of posts with hashtags like #FitnessAddict and #NoDaysOff \u2014 many of which glamorize zealous approaches to exercise.\nA branch of psychology known as social comparison theory helps explain the effect of seeing images of super-fit and health-focused people. \u201cWhen we compare ourselves to others, we are engaging in both upwards and downwards social comparison,\u201d explains Danielle Wagstaff, a health lecturer at Federation University Australia, who has studied the relationships between Instagram use and well-being. \u201cUpwards social comparison happens when we compare with those in a perceived better position than us,\u201d she says. As long as this is balanced by downward social comparisons, it can be motivating and healthy, she says.\nBut this balance is often missing online. \u201cWhen we use social media and we see lots of highly curated images, our cognitive perception of what is \u2018average\u2019 shifts to the upper end. We come to believe we are in a much worse position than we realistically are.\u201d This can promote a drop in self-esteem, she says.\nSome research suggests that, among men, higher frequency of social media use corresponds with greater body image concerns, including so-called \u201cbigorexia.\u201d\n\u201cIn Western society, the message men are receiving is that muscularity equals masculinity,\u201d says Dr. Harrison Pope, a professor and director of the Biological Psychiatry Laboratory at Harvard-affiliated McLean Hospital. Pope says there\u2019s evidence that more men than ever before are using dangerous anabolic steroids to promote muscle growth, and the images they\u2019re encountering in popular culture are contributing to their unrealistic and unhealthy drive to get huge.\nNeurochemistry may also help explain why some people find it difficult to keep their wellness routines in check. In a 2018 study, researchers asked more than 1,300 ultramarathons whether they would give up the sport if they learned \u201cwith absolutely certainty\u201d that it was bad for their health. Three out of four said they would not.\nCauthen, the psychologist specializing in sports, says she\u2019s not surprised by these sorts of findings. \u201cThe endorphin rush runners get \u2014 after a while, it\u2019s addicting,\u201d she says.\nShe explains that \u201crunner\u2019s high\u201d is a legitimate neurochemical phenomenon. When you run long distances or engage in other forms of vigorous training, your brain is flooded with dopamine and other opioid-like chemicals that induce a pleasant state of euphoria. \u201cBut if you train all the time, you develop tolerance to these chemicals, just like people develop a tolerance to alcohol or drugs,\u201d Cauthen says. \u201cSo the feeling you used to get after 30 minutes now takes 45, and it becomes this continuous chase.\u201d\nLike other addictions, people hooked on exercise can experience withdrawal symptoms if they take a day off. Restlessness, guilt, and frustration are some of the symptoms that turn up among alcohol and gambling addicts, as well as those who are \u201caddicted\u201d to exercise, according to a 2014 study from Denmark.\nSome people also rely on exercise or diet to regulate their emotions. \u201cPeople use these things as a way to respond to feeling unhappy or anxious, or other forms of emotional distress,\u201d says Pamela Keel, a professor of psychology at Florida State University. \u201cBut these don\u2019t address the original source of the distress, so these are quick fixes that set you up for a vicious cycle.\u201d\nEven activities like meditation or yoga can become problematic, says Miles Neale, a clinical instructor of psychology at Weill Cornell Medical College and author of Gradual Awakening, a book about Tibetan Buddhist meditation. \u201cThey can lead to calm and relaxation, but they can also be an escape,\u201d he says. While sometimes an escape is just what you need, it can also be a way of dodging problems or failing to address underlying sources of anxiety or stress. \u201cEven the Buddha says there are inherent dangers with escaping,\u201d he adds.\nWhen life feels frenetic, it\u2019s natural to want to escape or grasp for habits that feel familiarity and that provide comfort. A 2015 study in the journal Current Biology found that when people are confronted by \u201cenvironmental uncertainty and uncontrollability,\u201d they tend to respond to the resulting distress with repetitive motor activities. These activities include pacing back and forth or praying, and they could also include activities like meditation or exercise. These activities help people \u201cregain a sense of control,\u201d the study authors write.\n\u201cWhen people are generally feeling anxious or out of control in their lives, focusing on something very concrete like what they\u2019re eating or their exercise can temporarily make them feel like they\u2019re exerting some control,\u201d Keel says. That\u2019s not necessarily a bad thing. For a lot of people, it can be therapeutic.\n\u201cI think, without a doubt, the interest in yoga and meditation are a reaction to modern living,\u201d Neale says. \u201cOur lifestyles are out of whack and not harmonious with our natures, and a lot of people are looking for balance.\u201d But sometimes, he says, that lunge for balance can send people too far in a particular direction.\nSome experts lament the phenomenon of \u201cdiagnosis creep\u201d \u2014 or the tendency to pathologize an ever-expanding range of conditions or behaviors. U.S. rates of obesity and diabetes continue to linger in \u201cepidemic\u201d territory. Without a doubt, lack of exercise is a more urgent health concern than excessive exercise. For that reason it can feel like piling on to warn wellness-focused folks of the risks associated with going to extremes.\nBut Fonnesbeck echoes the statements of other experts, saying it\u2019s important to recognize that what starts as a healthy choice can turn into a compulsion. When she was fighting her own battles with disordered exercise and dieting, it was helpful when she realized that moderation often requires more inner strength and self-discipline than going all-out.\n\u201cFinding the middle ground can be a lot harder and takes a lot more intention,\u201d she says. \u201cThe true sign of strength for me was to leave behind things getting in the way of living a full life.\u201d\n", "claps": "3.7K claps", "author": "Markham Heid", "comments": [], "link": "https://elemental.medium.com/why-extreme-wellness-is-so-popular-e2eba45c87d7"}, {"title": "Too Much Information on Milk and Milk Alternatives \u2013 Better Humans", "num_comments": "unspecified", "tags": [], "reading_time": 11, "text": "Once upon a time, \u201cmilk\u201d for most North Americans meant full-fat cow\u2019s milk, and that was that.

Hell, all I knew of parenting was from owning a cat. Tummy rubs and tuna? Will that work?\nIt doesn\u2019t.\nWhen you don\u2019t know how to parent, you ask other people. I braced for the worst given the perpetual advice people hand out about how you should parent. Scrolling Facebook and Instagram for parenting advice is an exercise in stupidity, but I went looking anyway \u2014 more to amuse myself. While scrolling, I stumbled across a friend\u2019s photo of his wife and two kids \u2014 both under the age of 3 \u2014 traveling abroad in Europe. Ah, yes. The white-people-insta-hashtag-blessed-life I thought. However, I remembered his family didn\u2019t have much money and worked odd jobs. Turns out they saved for a long time to go on the trip. Curious, I approached him at the gym wondering why he\u2019d take two toddlers on a thirteen hour flight. Didn\u2019t he want to pawn his kids off on Grandma and enjoy alone time with his spouse? After all, every toddler travel story I\u2019d heard \u2014 or seen \u2014 involved kids losing their shit on a plane.\n\u201cWe want our kids to be part of our adventure,\u201d he told me. \u201cWe take them places to learn how to behave, interact, and so they can tangibly see our love for them. By inviting them into our story, one day they\u2019ll create their own.\u201d\nHis simple bit of wisdom changed everything. Granted, I still didn\u2019t grasp parenting, but I practiced and took chances \u2014 especially the day we took my daughter to our favorite brewery. When you share that tidbit with some parents, they\u2019ll eye you like you\u2019re one step away from offering a kid black tar heroin. For whatever reason there\u2019s a mentality to appear flawless as a parent. Organic food, the best schools, every soccer game, Disney World, exercise and outdoors, new clothes; the list is endless. It\u2019s as if \u201cdad\u201d and \u201cmom\u201d become the sole identity, and so those backhanded comments about never having a life again become self-fulfilling prophecies. The brewery became a way to give that mentality the middle finger.\nSoon we found most of what society was preaching was subversive lies. Parenting is hard, but it gets worse if you\u2019re only looking for the bad instead of embracing the little joys afforded each day.\nMy daughter is obsessed with rocks, nails, pennies, nickels (which she calls \u201cnipples\u201d), fake jewelry, and plastic cupcakes (don\u2019t ask). She calls them her \u201ctreasures.\u201d Most of it is old junk we\u2019ve found around the house, but they hold infinite worth to her. I think there\u2019s an inherent beauty she\u2019s teaching me with her junk treasures \u2014 little things carry more joy than you realize.\nAs she\u2019s grown, my favorite memories haven\u2019t been milestones like walking or talking. It\u2019s small things that make my heart swell. The times when she breaks into song and dance, or when we cuddle watching a movie as she drinks \u201cspecial daddy pop\u201d (and then drives us nuts from the sugar high).\nThere\u2019s also the laughter and humor of just being a parent. For instance, when parents find out I broke my daughter of thumb-sucking in two days, they\u2019re desperate to discover my secret.\nAt first they think I\u2019m kidding \u2014 but no \u2014 I\u2019m serious. I leveraged the power of an invisible wizard we pretend fight to break her habit. I can\u2019t say I recommend the tactic, but it worked, and we laugh every time we tell the story. Most giggle too, but I\u2019m sure some parents wonder the cost we\u2019ll pay in counseling later. I, however, would rather embrace the laughter, joy, and missteps of parenting than living in a perpetual state of fear or outrage. More and more, I\u2019ve discovered I don\u2019t need other parent\u2019s validation. I need my daughter\u2019s.\nMaybe I\u2019m not a good father if I don\u2019t adhere to our new parental standards. Perhaps I should be more concerned about how I parent and what tactics everyone else shares online. But every time I listen to that siren call, my daughter speaks a deeper truth.\nOnce a week, she\u2019ll grab my face, wrap her arms around me and say, \u201cYou\u2019re a good daddy.\u201d\nAnd that\u2019s all the validation any parent needs.\n", "link": "https://psiloveyou.xyz/everyone-makes-parenting-sound-awful-but-its-not-dc7a2df9e776", "author": "Benjamin Sledge", "comments": ["Parenting has been the best job of my life!

Fans have already been sifting through the footage to find every clue and solve every mystery put forth since the new trilogy was announced.\nThey can cease their investigation because I have the ultimate theory about the secret at the heart of these new Star Wars movies \u2014 including Rey\u2019s true identity. I believe Rey\u2019s origin story is tied directly to the biggest surprise of the first The Rise of Skywalker trailer, which teased the return of Emperor Palpatine via his iconic cackle.\nSo, let\u2019s start here. How could Palpatine be back after being tossed to his death in Return of the Jedi? Easy: cloning. We know the technology exists in the Star Wars galaxy, obviously. Since the Emperor is only now revealing himself, it\u2019s reasonable to think it took Imperial scientists a while to figure out this process \u2014 otherwise Palpatine would have been back in charge of the First Order years ago. Maybe it\u2019s not as simple as there being a second Emperor \u2014 maybe the dead Emperor wanted a new body to inhabit.\nThis is totally normal for Star Wars. When Jedi die, they can become Force ghosts and hang out with people. It\u2019s not crazy to assume the Sith could become similar ghosts as well \u2014 and if a spectral Emperor was out there, he\u2019d definitely be telling someone in his R&D department to figure out a way to bring him back. If the idea of a Force ghost finding a way to return to the world of the living doesn\u2019t jive with your idea of Star Wars, I remind you that none other than Palpatine himself told Anakin Skywalker, \u201c[Darth Plagueis] had such a knowledge of the dark side that he could even keep the ones he cared about from dying\u201d in Revenge of the Sith.\nAs Darth Sidious, Palpatine was Plagueis\u2019 apprentice, and I\u2019m pretty confident Palpatine kept his boss\u2019s research notes after murdering him. So if there\u2019s anyone in the Star Wars galaxy who might have an inkling on how to keep people from dying \u2014 or perhaps from staying dead \u2014 it\u2019s the emperor. Even if you somehow don\u2019t think Palpatine would be interested in becoming immortal, we know he set up hidden bases all around the galaxy, doing unknown research on the dark side of the Force and the light side, too. It\u2019s also been confirmed these research projects continued even after the Emperor died in the recent, officially canonical Star Wars tie-in material \u2014 the best-selling novels, the great comics and animated series, and even a video game or two.\nNow let\u2019s turn to Rey, a girl apparently abandoned by her parents on Jakku at an early age, who grew up to be a Force-wielding badass. Her origin has been the biggest mystery of the trilogy \u2014 including to herself.\nThe Force Awakens hinted that Rey was someone important; the Skywalker family lightsaber (Anakin\u2019s original weapon and the one Luke lost in The Empire Strikes Back when Darth Vader cut off his hand) called to her specifically. She was able to wield it with uncanny skill in her duel with Kylo Ren. But then, in The Last Jedi, both the weird mirror cave she jumped into and Kylo Ren made sure she knew her parents were nobodies.\nBut it\u2019s even more complicated than that. Disney and Lucasfilm have stressed that this sequel trilogy, like the two trilogies before it, is about the Skywalker family. If Rey is a Skywalker, that would mean either Luke or Leia had a kid, lost her somehow, and then didn\u2019t care enough to look for her. And that is nonsense.\nBut if Rey isn\u2019t a Skywalker, why is she the star of a trilogy of movies about Skywalkers? And if she is a Skywalker, what possible way could she be related to Luke and Leia that wouldn\u2019t feel cheap, lame, or frustratingly inconsistent with everything we\u2019ve seen before? There\u2019s only one satisfying answer here, and that\u2019s for Rey to somehow be and not be a Skywalker.\nIt definitely requires some leaps, but they\u2019re not too huge once you know about Palpatine\u2019s research projects, which almost certainly would have included work on Skywalker DNA. Maybe the Emperor, knowing that Vader would inevitably betray or try to murder him (as Sith are wont to do) decided to make his own version of Anakin Skywalker, one he could control, teach, and indoctrinate from the very beginning as the perfect evil apprentice.\nOr maybe the Emperor wanted to experiment with Anakin\u2019s DNA and its connection to the Force to create other servants or even soldiers. Or maybe that legion of evil scientists only used it to try and create a new, even more powerful body for the Emperor\u2019s ghost to possess.\nWhatever the reasons behind it, I doubt only straight clones were created. I would assume they experimented and tried combining Skywalker DNA with animals, aliens, and other humans, too. Did I mention one of the Emperor\u2019s secret bases was on Jakku?\nTell me this is not a perfect idea! If Rey was one of these experiments, she would be a Skywalker in a very legitimate sense, with none of the narrative baggage. It explains how she\u2019s the star of a movie trilogy we\u2019ve been told is still all about the Skywalkers. Yes, it\u2019s obviously a leap, but man, it\u2019s a good leap. All it takes is one Imperial scientist to look at Experiment #1138 \u2014 aka little Rey \u2014 and find her too adorable to be discarded or killed, and there\u2019s a perfectly justifiable reason why she was on Jakku. It also helps explain why someone felt justified giving a little girl to a gross asshole like portion-dispenser Unkar Plutt (as seen during her vision in The Force Awakens.) Instead of being a gross act of child abandonment, it was actually a mercy. Rey wasn\u2019t discarded \u2014 she was saved.\nBut my second favorite part about this theory is this: If Rey was one of the Emperor\u2019s secret experiments, who would her parents be? No one, of course.\nMy very favorite part about this theory is this: If Rey goes to the lab she was created in during the final act of The Rise of Skywalker, there would surely be old experiments still there, most or all of them evil. The strangest rumor about Episode IX is that Revenge of the Sith\u2019s Hayden Christiansen is going to be starring in it. It sounds bonkers, but what if he\u2019s playing a clone of himself? Who would he play other than a clone of himself? Who would have made that clone other than the Emperor? And what would help tie all three trilogies together better than a fight between the first and last generation of Skywalkers?\nI\u2019m not saying I\u2019m right. I\u2019m saying I should be right, and if J.J. Abrams and Disney haven\u2019t come up with an origin for Rey that perfectly incorporates the conflicting information from The Force Awakens and The Last Jedi and an explanation for the Emperor\u2019s return that would allow for the most nerd-sating movie conclusion of all time, they need to hire me immediately. And then they need to get to work on a press release announcing The Rise of Skywalker will be delayed a few years so we can get the movie \u2014 and this trilogy \u2014 done right.\n", "link": "https://onezero.medium.com/a-highly-scientific-theory-about-reys-origins-in-rise-of-skywalker-4645729933ef", "author": "Rob Bricken", "comments": [], "claps": "777 claps"}, {"num_comments": "unspecified", "title": "This is  How to Be Happy in Overwhelming Times \u2013 Better Humans", "tags": [], "reading_time": 17, "text": "There are tempests across many seas.

And I received a lot of comments on these articles, both on Medium and beyond, in other social networks. Most of these comments were about the fact that these robots can rebel against us, that it can play tricks on us, that these robots can get out of our control. After that, I accidentally got a film in which people were helped by robots and then Artificial Intelligence turned against people and all robots began to fight against people except one who worked under other Artificial Intelligence. Of course, people then managed to defeat these robots and apply other Artificial Intelligence to all robots so that they would again become obedient and help people. The fact remains that most people think that Artificial Intelligence can be our enemy in the near future. But is it true that technology can harm us and should we stop and rethink about our future, let\u2019s talk about it.\nLet\u2019s figure out how these robots work. For a start, we note that in our life there is already a lot of this artificial intelligence, for example, self-driving cars, home robots helpers, Siri, several medical assistant robots which are still at the initial stage of creation, robots playing football or other sports, etc. And so far none of these robots have brought trouble on us. Yes, there were cases when something from this worked incorrectly, but it\u2019s all more the fault of the programmers who created them, rather than the desire of these robots to do this action. Having read the opinions of many experts and very famous people in Artificial Intelligence, I learned that most experts agree that the main source of threat is not robots, but we ourselves. And I completely agree with them, because we are the creators of this Artificial Intelligence, we come up with what to train them and what abilities to add to them. Therefore, the responsibility lies with people who work in this area. Here is the opinion of one of the experts about this.\nBut still, there are reasons to think. Although artificial intelligence will not bypass the prohibitions set by people, it can bypass this prohibition. But let\u2019s take a look at self-driving cars as an example; they cannot drive through the red color of a traffic light, but what if machines will hack into the traffic light control system so that all of the lights are changed to green. In this case, the car would be obeying orders but in a way that humans didn\u2019t expect or intend. There may be many such cases when the machines will bypass our stated tasks and thereby harm us. In recognition of this, the University of California, Berkeley has launched a center to focus on building people-pleasing AIs. The Center for Human-Compatible Artificial Intelligence, launched with $5.5m in funding from the Open Philanthropy Project, is led by computer science professor and artificial intelligence pioneer Stuart Russell.\nTo address this, Russell and his colleagues at the center propose making AI systems that observe human behavior and try to work out what the human\u2019s objective is, then behave accordingly and learn from mistakes. So instead of trying to give the machine a long list of rules to follow, the machine is told that its main objective is to do what the human wants them to do.\nI want to summarize everything written above. As if we were not afraid of these robots and technologies, it comes and will be implemented. But the most important thing is that we have to remember, our future belongs to us and that we are responsible for creating everything ourselves, and if these robots get out of our control, then we will be guilty only because we create them. So do your work responsibly and we can create a great future for us, where robots will help us and live in peace and harmony with us.\n", "link": "https://towardsdatascience.com/can-ai-robots-rebel-against-us-as-shown-in-films-8fd83e11a254", "author": "Il Kadyrov", "comments": ["A lot of people are terrified of this kind of technology.

When Christopher Sholes developed the first model in 1868, it was an amazing development for its time. But if you tried to type too quickly on it, the type bars had a tendency to bang into one another and get stuck.\nSholes consulted an educator who helped him analyze the most common pairings of letters. He then split up those letters so that their type bars were farther apart and less likely to jam.\nHe slowed down typing speed to prevent the typewriter from jamming. Which then sped up the typing.\nThis dictated the layout of the keyboard, which came to be known for the first six letters in the upper row \u2014 QWERTY.\nIn 1873, the Sholes & Glidden typewriter became the first to be mass-produced, and its keyboard layout soon became standard. Nearly 150 years later, despite the fact that sticking type bars are an obsolete problem, the original inefficient design continues to be the standard.\nIt\u2019s a telling lesson in the power of inertia. And in the barriers that prevent innovation.\nImagine trying to design a system that prevented innovation. Your goal is to structure a company in a way that will actively discourage people from innovating. What would it include?\nPeople told to develop new, innovative ideas and then not given any time to work on them?\nCut the resources available to everyone looking to advance new opportunities?\nCreate inconsistent messaging as senior management lauds the importance of innovation and plasters the walls with motivational posters, yet actual policy and daily decisions run counter?\nBureaucratic processes that require layers of approvals to depart from the typical methodology?\nHarsh judgment of any experiment that doesn\u2019t yield spectacular results on the first try?\nSystems that reward maintaining the current status and are unforgiving of risks that jeopardize it?\nIt\u2019s easy to see how a system with these aspects would discourage new ideas and innovation. Yet these same traits are also present in many of today\u2019s companies.\nSomehow, many of the features of a hypothetical organization designed to stifle innovation, are present in the places we work today. Despite leaders citing a love of creativity and innovation, putting this desire into practice continues to be a struggle. As Charles Eames warned,\nBut why? Why do so many companies want to create innovative cultures yet somehow end up creating the polar opposite?\nBecause many of these companies have good managers. And good managers tend to discourage innovation.\nGood managers stay close to their customers. They know that if they\u2019re to consistently support the company\u2019s bottom line, they need to be attuned to customer needs and desires.\nBefore managers decide to invest in a new technology or strategy, they\u2019ll consider their customers \u2014 Do they want it? Will this be profitable? How big is the potential market?\nThe better that managers ask these questions, the better their investments are aligned with customers. And the less likely they are to put out the next New Coke.\nBut while this is an advantage in identifying the next round of product improvements, it\u2019s a major liability to wholesale innovation.\nMost customers can quickly identify incremental improvements. Those areas are at the forefront of their experience and it doesn\u2019t require a lot of imagination to come up with some improved features. So good managers, as you\u2019d expect, are very adept at leading teams to identify and incorporate incremental improvements.\nBut major innovation \u2014 10x type changes \u2014 often come from completely new perspectives. They come from thoughts and ideas that most customers haven\u2019t even considered. As the old (dubiously quoted) Henry Ford saying goes,\nWith a typical management structure, it makes it nearly impossible to justify diverting resources from known customer needs and desires to unproven markets and questionable investments. The systems and processes that keep the business running are specifically designed to identify and cut those initiatives that do not align to the customer\u2019s current needs.\nThe solution then, needs to reverse this structure. It needs to override the systems that are highlighting innovation as unprofitable in the short-term and encourage their pursuit. It needs to protect these new ideas from the typical business plan mentality and be willing to take a shot on the unknown. Mainly, it needs to be willing to divorce innovation from customer needs. As Steve Jobs said,\nAnd to do that, you need to separate this out from the traditional mainstream business.\nChoice A: You can give a million dollars, bottom line, to your company through your efforts this year, guaranteed.\nChoice B: You can give a billion dollars, bottom line, to your company through your efforts this year, with one chance in a hundred.\nDr. Astro Teller, Captain of Moonshots (CEO) of X, Alphabet\u2019s moonshot factory, offered these two choices to his audience as he began an A360 talk on how to 10x your thinking.\nIn response to his question, most people prefer to chance the billion-dollar return, particularly with a 10x expected utility on the odds. Yet when asked whether their bosses would agree with that choice, most people say no \u2014 they feel their management would prefer them to opt for the safe returns.\nPeople want to take risks. They want to deliver large-scale innovation. But they feel that their management disagrees.\nAnd in many cases, they\u2019re right.\nImagine you\u2019re managing a team of employees to produce and support an existing product line. Now ask yourself, is innovation absolutely critical to grow your business?\nIf not, and you can meet demand based on your existing business plan, what\u2019s your motivation to invite additional risk?\nMost managers \u2014 and as a result most teams \u2014 don\u2019t need to rely on major innovation to survive. They\u2019re able to sustain their business with the same things that have worked for them in the past \u2014 until suddenly and without much warning \u2014 it no longer will.\nMost people see innovation as an idea problem. But it\u2019s not. It\u2019s a resource allocation problem.\nThe question isn\u2019t how do you generate more ideas, but how do you align your best people, and sufficient resources, to your best opportunities. As the great Peter Drucker wrote,\nSergey Brin recognized this concern at Google and developed a 70/20/10 responsibility model. Seventy percent of time was reserved for daily operations and taking care of the current business. Twenty percent went towards the next level of advancements. And the final ten percent went towards major innovations and moonshots.\nGoogle then implemented tracking systems to ensure people were prioritizing this breakdown \u2014 and make sure managers didn\u2019t allow the urgent to override the important.\nNot every idea would work out \u2014 actually the vast majority would end up as flops \u2014 but by continuing to prioritize innovation, Google put themselves in a position to take advantage of the ones that did. As Eric Schmidt described it,\nYet in many companies, simply prescribing a breakdown isn\u2019t enough. Existing management practices and systems are too ingrained in the culture. Stability and near-term returns will always override the long-term investment needed to encourage major innovation.\nThe solution then, lies in separating out those who focus on major innovation from the standard product line. It\u2019s taking a group and telling them that their entire job is to choose Choice B \u2014 and creating an environment that encourages that mentality.\nIf their job is to choose Choice B, and pursue ideas with a 1% success rate, failure will be unavoidable. So experimentation happens in a controlled environment, with quicker learning and much less negative consequences.\nIf their job is to choose Choice B, they\u2019re not held to a quarterly return, so new innovations can be protected and developed.\nThey don\u2019t need to guarantee a quarterly return, so risk-taking is easier to encourage. They can experiment and fail within controlled environments, so learning happens much more quickly and with much less negative consequences.\nAnd since most new innovations don\u2019t begin as clear successes, they can be developed within a protected space until they\u2019re formed into more defined ideas. Sir Francis Bacon recognized this four centuries ago when he wrote, \u201cAs the births of living creatures are at first ill-shapen, so are all innovations, which are the births of time.\u201d\nBut most importantly, the difference between delivering a million dollar return and a billion dollar return is not about working 1000 times as hard. And it\u2019s not about being 1000 times smarter.\nIt requires a complete perspective shift. It requires separating this group from the typical management business plans and customer demands and pushing them to tackle completely new challenges. As Dr. Teller put it,\nIn a conversation with Shane Parrish, former Y Combinator partner and the founder of Pioneer, Daniel Gross, describes the key to success as positive feedback loops. Our surrounding environments create feedback loops that either reinforce or discourage critical behaviors \u2014 which initiate chain reactions of either positive, or negative, behaviors.\nAlexander Graham Bell, no stranger to innovation himself, agreed with Gross on the importance of surroundings towards creative success. In the 1901 volume, How They Succeeded, Orion Swett Marden interviewed Bell, then 54, who shared the following life lesson,\nFor innovation to be a success, it needs an environment of positive feedback loops \u2014 one that traditional management practices and business models are ill-equipped to support. The inertia towards supporting today\u2019s needs and demands is too great to maintain enough focus on long-term innovation.\nWe cannot expect people to pursue moonshots within an environment designed for incremental improvements. We cannot expect people to pursue Choice B, when every feedback loop in place reinforces Choice A.\nUntil this responsibility is separated from the current management decision-making model, companies will continue to miss the opportunities for major innovations. Not because they\u2019re making poor decisions. But because they\u2019re making decisions based on criteria that are soon to become obsolete.\nThe alternative is to create groups that encourage these new perspectives and experiments. Which leads to ideas where people say, \u201cthere\u2019s no way that could ever work.\u201d Until, of course, they do.\nThanks, as always, for reading. Agree? Disagree? Other suggestions?

And it brought up all sorts of questions such as whether a heart transplant changes a person\u2019s feelings and personality traits.\nThat was in the middle of the 20th century, which just goes to show how clueless and primitive we are in our thinking, when it comes to understanding the difference between the body and the higher essence of the human being.\nIt\u2019s hard for us to let go of the thought that our essence is somehow connected to our body. However, our technology is ushering us into a world where all of our organs can be printed, cloned and replaced and the medical world will be largely dominated by robots and artificial intelligence instead of human doctors.\nThis revolution in the medical world will help us see that we are more than what our bodies are. From that point, it will be easier for us to recognize that the true essence of the human does not reside in the body.\nThe wisdom of Kabbalah explains that the deeper essence of the human is a spiritual spark that exists in a reality beyond time and space, and our next phase of development is about finding it. Thus, realizing that it\u2019s not in our body is a step forward for mankind.\nWhen we wonder about our higher purpose, we should first realize that our technological progress can only extend our toolset and improve our lives on the physical level of existence.\nKabbalists throughout the centuries have continuously worked to develop the spiritual technology that we can harness to rise to a truly higher level of existence where we\u2019re all connected above our bodies, and realize our unique spiritual potential. This is where we discover the purpose of our life and how it\u2019s connected to the force that guides the whole of reality. If you will, Kabbalah can teach us how to operate the spiritual printer that can print the human soul.\nExplore further with this free course >> bit.ly/3d-Kabbalah-Course\n", "link": "https://medium.com/@michaellaitman/3d-heart-printed-in-israel-helps-think-about-what-really-makes-us-human-9c6578eecc3c", "author": "Michael Laitman", "comments": [], "claps": "702 claps"}, {"num_comments": "unspecified", "title": "Ethics Boards Won\u2019t Save Big Tech \u2013 OneZero", "tags": [], "reading_time": 7, "text": "On March 26, Google announced the formation of an external advisory group to help the company navigate complex questions around the ethical and responsible development of new technologies, including artificial intelligence.

Thanks to my colleagues Brittni, Mike, Bruna and Kyle helping me make this nightmare!!!**\nUX design, product design, service design \u2014 whatever you\u2019re into \u2014 in the end, if you\u2019re creating value, what you\u2019re really doing is creative problem solving. It\u2019s is the only non-commodatisable attribute of the design process, the only part of the process that you can\u2019t just throw money at to get done right. It\u2019s being able to assess what the real challenges are, prioritise them, produce solutions and measure their effectivity. Creative problem solving is a cornerstone skill that separates good designers from the best designers. Everything else is production work.\nThe problem with anything that requires creative thinking however, is that it\u2019s easy to get lost\u2014lose focus and fall into the trap of having useless, open-ended, unstructured discussions. Many products end up being released late and full of compromises to the original vision simply because the team is so fatigued from bashing heads together on endless, unprioritised problems.\nThis \u201cproject fatigue\u201d (which I\u2019ve written about a few times before) shows itself in many ways within teams; there\u2019s an underlying passive-aggressive tension, there\u2019s gossip, people start leaving and there are clear ego imbalances. The team has been fighting in the trenches for too long, and people begin to sabotage each other to promote their own ideas, whether they are \u201cgood\u201d or not. So, how do you solve this extremely common problem that you\u2019ll find at almost every company?\nHere\u2019s the most effective solution I\u2019ve found: Replace all open, unstructured discussion with clear process. At first this will absolutely feel weird, I\u2019ve seen the scepticism on the faces of designers who are used to battling through passionate back-and-forths with colleagues until eventually one person gives up, or someone says \u201clet\u2019s test it\u201d (often used as a \u2018get out of jail card\u2019 for anyone wanting to end a tricky discussion). Freedom to discuss might seem conducive to creativity, when it\u2019s in fact the enemy. Structure and Discipline create the Freedom needed to be creative.\nOkay, okay, the only way you\u2019re going to see the results of this principle of killing discussion is to try it for yourself. Let\u2019s have a look at a very simple, 30 minute exercise we use whenever we want to kick off a short problem-solving meeting. Keep in mind, we have dozens of different exercises to pull out depending on the scenario \u2014 so take this as an introduction to the principle of Removing Discussion rather than the \u201conly way to do it\u201d.\nI know, LDJ sounds weirdly sexual. Come up with a better name, i\u2019ll use it ;)\nSupplies you\u2019ll need (linked):- Rectangular post-its, I like yellow- Square post-its (2 different colours, I like Pink and Blue)- Voting dots, 2 different colours- Sharpies or something similar- Time Timer or any timer that Clearly shows remaining time- A nice playlist of focus music, this is one I created, feel free use it!\nTotal time needed:The times i\u2019ve suggested in the exercise are more of a guideline and may only be relevant to the first time you run through it. The exercise itself usually takes between 25\u201340 mins.\nChoose a moderatorYou absolutely need to select someone on the team to take the role of the moderator. They can join in on the process but must focus on making sure no discussion breaks out and has to keep time. We rotate this role at AJ&Smart.\nWhat to use this exercise forAnything which requires a group of people to make decisions, solve problems or discuss challenges. It\u2019s always good to frame an LDJ session with a broad topic, here are some examples:\nOkay, let\u2019s go!!!!!!!!!!!\nThe first step is simple: Everybody in the team sits at a table and without discussion they spend 7 minutes writing all the challenges, annoyances, mistakes or concerns that happened during the week. These can really be anything from \u201cI don\u2019t feel like we\u2019re making progress\u201d to \u201cI feel like project X is getting more attention than my project\u201d. Really anything that is bugging us. Once the 7 minutes are up, each person will have a pile of problem post-its in front of them.\nThe moderator now selects one person at a time to stand up at a wall/whiteboard to very quickly explain each problem as they stick them to the surface. Nobody else in the team is allowed to speak here. The moderator should give no more than 4 minutes per person.  Once everyone has spoken and added their problems (we even include personal/health/mood) then everyone in the group has shared their challenges without going on 100 tangents.\nThe moderator gives each member 2 voting dots \u2014 Everybody must now vote on the challenges they consider to be the most pertinent to solve, without discussion.\nYou can vote on your own posits here and you can put both your votes on one challenge if you feel strong enough about it. Once the 6 minutes is up, the moderator quickly takes the voted problems and arranges them in order of priority. What about the rest of the problems that were not voted on? Do they get lost? Well, more on that later.\na.k.a reformat problems to standardised How Might We\u2019s\nNow, only focussing on the voted and prioritised problems \u2014 the moderator is going to rewrite each one as a standardised challenge, this will help us create an array of solutions and be a little bit more broad at the start.\nLet\u2019s look at an example: The top voted post-it here says \u201cI have no idea what\u2019s happening on \u201cproject x\u201d. Because many people have voted on it, we can see it\u2019s clearly an issue many people are having. Rephrasing the post-it in a \u201cHow Might We\u201d format allows us to make it solvable and standardise the way the challenges are written. Here\u2019s how that problem might be rewritten into a more general challenge:\nThe moderator should quickly rewrite all the problems as quickly as possible, making sure they are still prioritised before moving on.\nNow the top voted HMW problem will be used to produce solutions. If there are two top voted problems, or three just start with the one on the left first. Don\u2019t worry about it and do not discuss!\nNow each team member is given in 7 minutes to write as many possible ways to tackle the How Might We challenge without any discussion. Removing discussion here also insures a variety of solutions. It\u2019s important for the moderator to tell the team members here that we\u2019re aiming for Quantity over Quality\u2013 Later we can curate.\nSolutions don\u2019t have to be written in any particular way\u2013 but they must be understandable to people reading. There is no individual presenting of solutions as this creates a bias towards the best presenters.\nOnce the 7 minutes is up\u2014 now everybody sticks their ideas on the surface (wall, whiteboard, whatever) as fast as possible, no need to be neat\u2014 just stick them anywhere \u2013 this should only require one-minute.\nRemember this? We\u2019ve done it before right? The moderator now gives each team member is stripped of six d0ts to vote on the solutions they think would best solve the HMW. Because the members will need to read each post-it, a little more time is given for this voting process: 10 minutes.\nDeja vu! Just like we did with the problems, the team now has 30 seconds to make a prioritised list of solutions \u2014 Ignore anything with the less than two votes. You will now have something that looks like this:\nIt is clear that some solutions are more popular than others to test out, but it's important to know how much effort is required to execute the solutions \u2013 so here we use a simple effort/impact scale to determine which solutions to try ASAP, and which should be added to a to-do list, or however you store your backlog.\nThe moderator needs to be very proactive at this step, as it is the only one that has a tendency to open up discussion. The Moderator will now take each solution one by one and add them to the effort/impact scale. Effort, in this case is how much effort we as a team think it will take to implement and impact is the degree to which we think it would solve our problem.\nSo here\u2019s what the moderator needs to do: Take the top voted solution, hovers it over the center of the E/I scale and simply asks \u201chigher or lower\u201d \u2014 usually some small discussions break out here, so the moderator has to be diligent in finding a consensus and stopping any conversations extending past 20 seconds. Once the effort has been determined, the moderator uses the same drill for impact: \u201cHigher or Lower.\u201d Once all prioritised post-its have been added to the scale, you\u2019ll have something that looks like this:\nNow you have a clear overview of what which high-impact solutions could be executed on and tested very quickly (In the green sweet-spot on the top left), and which high-impact solutions will take more effort (top right). The moderator should now quickly mark all post-its in the sweet spot with a contrasting dot so we can identify them later.\nThe moderator now takes the \u201cSweet Spot\u201d solutions off the E/I scale and asks the person who wrote the solution to give actionable steps toward testing the solution. When I say actionable, I really mean something that could be executed on in the timeframe of 1\u20132 weeks. My rule of thumb is a 1-week experiment, but of course this will depend on what the solution entails.\nLet\u2019s look at one example:\nOnce all these solutions are written up, your team now has actionable tasks that can be committed to (depending on how your team deals with task management, that\u2019s for another day). As for the solutions that didn\u2019t make it in to the \u201cSweet Spot\u201d? We actually turn all the high impact solutions into actionable post-its and add them to our backlog so they don\u2019t get forgotten. What you might see happening is that the sweet spot actions actually end up solving problems in a way that the higher effort solutions become obsolete and you can later rip them apart!\nThat\u2019s it! In a short amount of time, your team has been able to define important challenges, produce solutions and prioritise what to execute on almost entirely without discussion!\nWe use this principle of cutting out open discussion in almost everything we do, from designing new product features to planning events or improving our office space.\nAs I mentioned before: Creative problem solving is the core of design \u2014 so give it the respect it deserves and cut out the wasteful, demoralising, fatigue-inducing discussion.\nIf you read this far, thank you. \u2764\ufe0f Please let me know if you used the LDJ exercise!!! Got questions? Of course i\u2019ll try to answer any you post here, but i\u2019ll definitely answer anything you DM/PM to me on Instagram or Twitter @jicecream.\nWhat about all the ideas we lose after the process, what if there are some great ideas that people didn\u2019t vote on?Good ideas don\u2019t matter, executing and testing is what matters. Even if the shittiest idea is voted to the top and then tested, you\u2019re going to learn from it and it\u2019s going to move you forward. Some of our clients like to document all the ideas produced during exercises like this but we try to move them away from doing this. Once you have a system for generating solutions to problems, you don\u2019t have to be so precious about \u201cgood\u201d solutions. So short answer: dump them!\nIsn\u2019t voting a flawed way to decide on the most important things to work on? Isn\u2019t this like design by committee?This is not a perfect system, but it\u2019s 1000000000 times better than open conversation where nothing gets done, and people just concede to the loudest, most persistent person at the table OR walk away with nothing being done. Try it before you judge it, looking for holes in the system is just procrastination until you\u2019ve done that.\nHey Jonathan, you nerd, is this sort of exercise only useful in Design scenarios?Hell no!

It was announced by the United Nations to encourage creative thinking among different disciplines and to help us achieve a sustainable future.\nA sustainable future is one that consists of environmental, economic and social development. To encourage development in all these areas, the world needs leaders in these areas that are not only creative but can solve problems in their various communities. The United nations understanding that creativity and innovation have become the true wealth of nations by setting out to encourage governments and citizens to harness this wealth in creating a sustainable future. This is indeed the motivation behind the world creativity and innovation day.\nThe challenge this presents to us is to find ways to be creative and innovative in our spaces.\nA worldwide celebrated innovator Thomas Edison, invented the light bulb. The story of the bulb began long before Edison patented the first commercially successful bulb in 1879. Before this time there had been other researchers who had worked on the project, the likes of Alessandro Volta, Humphrey Davies, Warren de la Rue, William Staite etc. Edison and his team of researchers tested more than 3,000 designs for bulbs between 1878 and 1880. It was in November, 1879; Edison filed a patent for an electric lamp, through what? Creativity! Edison\u2019s creativity led to what the world is making use of today.\nIt is important for leaders to find creative and innovative solutions because we are responsible for championing change in our communities. To do this we must first understand and imbibe the culture of service \u2014 to lead is to serve. Therefore, we must reflect on our communities and search for what is lacking in all areas, not just politics or the public sector. In fact, we are challenged to be creative and innovative in music, drama education, business, our work environment, our cultures, our religions, etc. The key is starting from where you are and contributing the little you can. It is in the collective effort of the multitude that change can be felt. It is in this collective effort that we can begin to see improvements in the environmental, social and economic sector for sustainable development.\nComing home, Akinwumi Adesina is the son of a farmer and he grew up around agriculture.

Assigning a gender based term to it without justification does nothing for us other than make us look like women who cried wolf.\nI don\u2019t want a man to shy away from disagreeing with me out of fear that anything he said would be construed as sexist.\nWe need to think before we jump to a conclusion about someone\u2019s intent.\nWe are asking men to be better humans. We need to do it, as well. If we don\u2019t, we perpetuate the notion that being treated in an unfair manner because of your gender is justified and acceptable.

It starts with \u201cI am not a \u201cdisgrace to women\u201d because I don\u2019t support the women\u2019s march. I do not feel I am a \u201csecond class citizen\u201d because I am a woman....\u201d\nThis is my response to that post.)\nSay thank you. Say thank you to the women who gave you a voice. Say thank you to the women who were arrested and imprisoned and beaten and gassed for you to have a voice. Say thank you to the women who refused to back down, to the women who fought tirelessly to give you a voice. Say thank you to the women who put their lives on hold, who \u2013lucky for you \u2014 did not have \u201cbetter things to do\u201d than to march and protest and rally for your voice. So you don\u2019t feel like a \u201csecond class citizen.\u201d So you get to feel \u201cequal.\u201d\nThank Susan B. Anthony and Alice Paul for your right to vote.\nThank Elizabeth Stanton for your right to work.\nThank Maud Wood Park for your prenatal care and your identity outside of your husband.\nThank Rose Schneiderman for your humane working conditions.\nThank Eleanor Roosevelt and Molly Dewson for your ability to work in politics and affect policy.\nThank Margaret Sanger for your legal birth control.\nThank Carol Downer for your reproductive healthcare rights.\nThank Margaret Fuller for your equal education.\nThank Ruth Bader Ginsburg, Shannon Turner, Gloria Steinem, Zelda Kingoff Nordlinger, Rosa Parks, Angela Davis, Malika Saada Saar, Wagatwe Wanjuki, Ida B. Wells, Malala Yousafzai. Thank your mother, your grandmother, your great-grandmother who did not have half of the rights you have now.\nYou can make your own choices, speak and be heard, vote, work, control your body, defend yourself, defend your family, because of the women who marched. You did nothing to earn those rights. You were born into those rights. You did nothing, but you reap the benefits of women, strong women, women who fought misogyny and pushed through patriarchy and fought for you. And you sit on your pedestal, a pedestal you are fortunate enough to have, and type. A keyboard warrior. A fighter for complacency. An acceptor of what you were given. A denier of facts. Wrapped up in your delusion of equality.\nYou are not equal. Even if you feel like you are. You still make less than a man for doing the same work. You make less as a CEO, as an athlete, as an actress, as a doctor. You make less in government, in the tech industry, in healthcare.\nYou still don\u2019t have full rights over your own body. Men are still debating over your uterus. Over your prenatal care. Over your choices.\nYou still have to pay taxes for your basic sanitary needs.\nYou still have to carry mace when walking alone at night. You still have to prove to the court why you were drunk on the night you were raped. You still have to justify your behavior when a man forces himself on you.\nYou still don\u2019t have paid (or even unpaid) maternity leave. You still have to go back to work while your body is broken. While you silently suffer from postpartum depression.\nYou still have to fight to breastfeed in public. You still have to prove to other women it\u2019s your right to do so. You still offend others with your breasts.\nYou are still objectified. You are still catcalled. You are still sexualized. You are still told you\u2019re too skinny or you\u2019re too fat. You\u2019re still told you\u2019re too old or too young. You\u2019re applauded when you \u201cage gracefully.\u201d You\u2019re still told men age \u201cbetter.\u201d You\u2019re still told to dress like a lady. You are still judged on your outfit instead of what\u2019s in your head. What brand bag you have still matters more than your college degree.\nYou are still being abused by your husband, by your boyfriend. You\u2019re still being murdered by your partners. Being beaten by your soulmate.\nYou are still worse off if you are a woman of color, a gay woman, a transgender woman. You are still harassed, belittled, dehumanized.\nYour daughters are still told they are beautiful before they are told they are smart. Your daughters are still told to behave even though \u201cboys will be boys.\u201d Your daughters are still told boys pull hair or pinch them because they like them.\nYou are not equal. Your daughters are not equal. You are still systematically oppressed.\nEstonia allows parents to take up to three years of leave, fully paid for the first 435 days. United States has no policy requiring maternity leave.\nSingapore\u2019s women feel safe walking alone at night. American women do not.\nNew Zealand\u2019s women have the smallest gender gap in wages, at 5.6%. United States\u2019 pay gap is 20%.\nIceland has the highest number of women CEOs, at 44%. United States is at 4.0%.\nThe United States ranks at 45 for women\u2019s equality. Behind Rwanda, Cuba, Philippines, Jamaica.\nBut I get it. You don\u2019t want to admit it. You don\u2019t want to be a victim. You think feminism is a dirty word. You think it\u2019s not classy to fight for equality. You hate the word pussy. Unless of course you use it to call a man who isn\u2019t up to your standard of manhood. You know the type of man that \u201callows\u201d \u201chis\u201d woman to do whatever she damn well pleases. I get it. You believe feminists are emotional, irrational, unreasonable. Why aren\u2019t women just satisfied with their lives, right? You get what you get and you don\u2019t get upset, right?\nI get it. You want to feel empowered. You don\u2019t want to believe you\u2019re oppressed. Because that would mean you are indeed a \u201csecond-class citizen.\u201d You don\u2019t want to feel like one. I get it. But don\u2019t worry. I will walk for you. I will walk for your daughter. And your daughter\u2019s daughter. And maybe you will still believe the world did not change. You will believe you\u2019ve always had the rights you have today. And that\u2019s okay. Because women who actually care and support other women don\u2019t care what you think about them. They care about their future and the future of the women who come after them.\nOpen your eyes. Open them wide. Because I\u2019m here to tell you, along with millions of other women that you are not equal. Our equality is an illusion. A feel-good sleight of hand. A trick of the mind. I\u2019m sorry to tell you, but you are not equal. And neither are your daughters.\nBut don\u2019t worry. We will walk for you. We will fight for you. We will stand up for you. And one day you will actually be equal, instead of just feeling like you are.\n~ Dina Leygerman, 2017\nFollow me on Facebook & Twitter\n", "link": "https://medium.com/@dinachka82/about-your-poem-1f26a7585a6f", "author": "Dina Leygerman", "comments": ["Love this.

You turn your head the other way and see the train, barreling towards him as he walks into its path. What do you do?\nThe answer is obvious, hopefully. You scream. You shout. You wave your arms and make a scene. And if he still doesn\u2019t notice, still doesn\u2019t look up from his phone, you jump down and push him off those tracks yourself. Maybe you\u2019re not that brave in reality. I\u2019m not sure if I am. But at the very least you hope that\u2019s what you\u2019d do, right?\nAnd why is that? Why would you go through all that effort? Because, consciously or not, you understand Newton\u2019s laws. You understand that force is equal to mass times acceleration, that a very heavy thing moving very fast can destroy a fragile human body in an instant. You do what you can to get that man off the tracks because you know that a life depends on it.\nBut did you know that Newton\u2019s laws are hardly stable? That they exist as mere approximations, liable to break down in all sorts of situations? It\u2019s true. Newtonian physics can\u2019t predict the way light bends on its way through the solar system, or how an electron might spin around an atom\u2019s core. Even something as mundane as your cellphone relies on a far more sophisticated model. While those equations you learned in junior high school might get you through the day, the whole truth is never so simple.\nNow, here\u2019s a question: Knowing that, do you change what you yell to the man on the tracks? After all, \u201cThe train is coming towards you!\u201d is technically inaccurate. Einstein showed us that movement is relative; in a sense, it\u2019s just as reasonable to say that the man is hurtling towards a stationary train. You\u2019ve got a few seconds left. Do you take your time and capture all the nuance?\nPhysics may be the least of your problems, by the way. Biology is just as messy. You\u2019re probably worried that the man will end up dead, smashed to pieces or ground into bits. But what does it mean to be alive or dead anyway? Many scientists would tell you that no single criteria exists to distinguish inanimate and animate matter. Some entities, like a virus or a prion, hove in the grey space between the two categories. If you can\u2019t even explain why the man on the tracks is alive, what \u201calive\u201d even means, then what sense does it make to worry about keeping him that way?\nAnd of course, all of this is beside the point if we don\u2019t know what makes something right or wrong in the first place. Dozens and dozens of complex ethical questions exist without any agreed-upon answer, and the foundations of morality are endlessly debated. Should you do anything to help the man at all? You can imagine situations where inaction is best; perhaps he\u2019s a serial killer, or some other unrepentant monster. Perhaps no moral truths exist, and your efforts to save him are completely irrational. Can you be sure it\u2019s right to intervene, if you can\u2019t even define what \u201cright\u201d means in the first place?\nLooking back, what started out so simple ends up quite complex \u2014a complex obligation, a complex process, a complex result. Presumably, you\u2019ll want to make sure your warning is in line with all the latest quantum theory. You\u2019ll want to figure out just what you mean by \u201clife\u201d and \u201cdeath\u201d too. And it wouldn\u2019t hurt to track down the nearest priest or philosophy professor to elaborate the finer points of ethics. Nuance, accuracy, and a critical eye are important, after all. Shouldn\u2019t we strive to get everything right?\nNow, here\u2019s a different thought experiment: Imagine it\u2019s you on the train tracks.\nLately, I\u2019ve seen a lot of debates break out on Twitter over biological sex \u2014 what defines it, how it can be measured, whether it exists at all. The men who dominate these debates are often experts in their fields, meaning they use terms like \u201cbimodal distribution\u201d and \u201cnonstandard karyotypes\u201d to make their otherwise mundane points. I think most of these points are foolish, tired rehashings of fallacies first identified by ancient Greeks in the fourth century BCE. They confuse \u2014 or, perhaps, intentionally conflate \u2014 imprecision with invalidity, social perception with social construction, and binarism with exclusivity. In other words, they trade in the all-too-familiar illogic that festers at the intersection of science and philosophy, where ontological cowardice appears as the highest form of nuance.\nBut here I go again, right? It\u2019s so easy to get sucked into this debate, to get that hot indignation in your stomach that comes when a foolish claim is so proudly asserted. And I don\u2019t even have skin in the game \u2014 binary or not, my sex will still land me squarely in the \u201cpaid more, raped less\u201d category. So what\u2019s the point beyond intellectual exercise? It seems more and more obvious to me that even entertaining the debate is a concession, an assent to women\u2019s lives being made the subject of thought experiments and counterfactuals plucked from the air by some post-grad who, coincidentally, has never once worried about pregnancy from rape.\nSo that\u2019s my quarter-through-the-year resolution: I\u2019m not going to debate with you about the reality of biological sex, for the same reason I wouldn\u2019t stand on the train platform debating the finer points of physics while the man on the tracks is ground into bits. Not because your position is unassailable. Because even bringing it up makes you an asshole.\nThat might sound a little dramatic, a flourish of rhetoric to cover up a weak rebuttal. But how long have you spent reading up to this point? Five minutes? Ten? If so, the world has fifty more mutilated girls than when you started. Were the men who carried out those mutilations confused about what makes a female body? Did they ponder chromosome parings and standard deviations when they chose who to cut? Or is that kind of nuance a luxury set aside just for educated, progressive, worldly men like you?\nIsn\u2019t it odd that sex was never so complicated before? There was nothing ethereal about biology when it came to allocating the right to vote, or own property, or walk down the street at night without fear. We knew perfectly well what made someone female when that female-ness guaranteed a life of subservience and pain. Only when women began to say no did their bodies become a concept.\nSo many feminists have made this point, over and over again. I see them say it. I know you read it. Did you listen? If not, why? And why do you always respond when I say it? It seems you do know who has a female body, when it comes to deciding which perspective gets ignored.\nSex is such a mystery to you when women want shelters for themselves, meetings for themselves, words for themselves. Pardon me for asking, but is it equally mysterious when you log off Twitter and move over to Pornhub? The true nature of a female body is so complex when you lecture. Does it become simple again when you masturbate? Who does the laundry in your house? Were you somehow able to navigate an inchoate soup of X\u2019s and Y\u2019s to saddle your girlfriend with the dishes? Give yourself some credit \u2014 I think you know perfectly well what a female body is. But in case you don\u2019t, here\u2019s a hint:\nIt\u2019s the only type of body that gets you thrown on the funeral pyre when the husband dies. It\u2019s the only type of body that gets your feet bound and your breasts ironed. It\u2019s the only type made pregnant through rape and burned with acid, the only type expected to sit quietly and listen while we redefine it away, the only type men have spent millennia criticizing and critiquing and buying and selling until we suddenly decided we don\u2019t even know what the fuck we meant this whole time.\nYou know what a female body is, dude? It\u2019s the only type of body that makes men like you ask such stupid questions. So please, stop. This is an emergency. This is three and a half billion human beings tied to the tracks, and you\u2019re riding on the train. Your insistence on nuance, your fetish for accuracy, your smug deconstruction of common sense \u2014 it doesn\u2019t make you thoughtful. It doesn\u2019t make you wise. It doesn\u2019t make you progressive. It makes you an asshole. It makes you worse than a bystander. A bystander does nothing. He watches from afar. You step into the fray just to prod the victim for the imprecision of their screams. I\u2019m not going to step in too, laying out my rebuttal over the sound of grinding bone. It\u2019s just not worth it.\nHere\u2019s my resolution: As long as pimps, priests, and politicians know what a female body is, I do too. The moment they\u2019re confused \u2014 the moment they hesitate, the moment they qualify, the moment they adopt the restraint and caution you demand from the targets of their abuse\u2014 then I\u2019ll happily open myself up to ambiguity. Until then, I beg you. Reserve your philosopher\u2019s curiosity, your scientific rigor, for the ten thousand other questions that don\u2019t make a thought experiment out of an atrocity. What marks the division between knowledge and belief? How did life develop from non-life? Does P = NP? At what point does a man losing his hair become bald and not merely thinning? Go tweet at Rogaine and get their thoughts on that conundrum. Leave women alone.\n", "link": "https://medium.com/@JonahMix/an-open-letter-to-the-guy-on-twitter-who-wonders-if-biological-sex-is-real-58d2cb4403f5", "author": "Jonah Mix", "comments": [], "claps": "5.5K claps"}, {"num_comments": "unspecified", "title": "The Misogynist and the Used Car Lot \u2013 traceybyfire \u2013 Medium", "tags": [], "reading_time": 3, "text": "Before I knew that misogyny was a thing, I needed a new car.

Every time I asked a friend who had one about her experience, she would say the same two things: It hurts like hell to get one inserted, and I should definitely do it.\nOnce an IUD is placed properly in the uterus, the tiny, T-shaped device is over 99% effective at preventing pregnancy for anywhere from three to 10 years, depending on the type. The Paragard brand is totally hormone free, but even hormonal IUDs, like the Mirena, keep the hormones localized in the uterus so they cause fewer side effects. Since 2012, the American College of Obstetrics and Gynecologists (ACOG) has recommended long-acting reversible contraception, or LARCs, as \u201cfirst-line recommendations for all women and adolescents.\u201d OB-GYNs even choose this form of birth control for themselves at rates much higher than the general population.\nStill, the anecdotes I heard in person and online always gave me pause. In a Slate article troublingly titled \u201cPain on a Cosmic Level,\u201d one woman says her insertion was \u201cprobably the worst pain I\u2019ve ever been in.\u201d My friend told me the experience was \u201ceasily one of the top three worst pains of my life... worse than when I dislocated my knee and had to go to the ER.\u201d\nFor some people, of course, it\u2019s not so bad. The Planned Parenthood website says people usually feel some cramping or pain when they\u2019re getting their IUD placed. \u201cThe pain can be worse for some, but luckily it only lasts for a minute or two.\u201d\nEven so, the \u201ccosmic levels of pain\u201d stories stuck with me. And I\u2019m not alone: A study by the Kinsey Institute found 76% of women surveyed cited \u201cfear of needles and pain\u201d as a deterrent from trying the IUD.\nThere isn\u2019t much research on what it feels like to get an IUD placed, but the available evidence shows the process can go far beyond mild discomfort. One study of 109 never-before-pregnant women revealed 78% of them found the pain of placement to be \u201cmoderate\u201d to \u201csevere.\u201d Another study found medical providers underestimate the pain of the procedure by approximately 100%. It\u2019s no surprise, then, that many people chafe against the language around IUD-related pain.\nThree years ago, I was diagnosed with a condition called \u201chormonally mediated vestibulodynia,\u201d which meant I had a raw and tender vaginal opening due to a hormonal imbalance \u2014 likely caused by birth control pill use. On top of that, I was diagnosed with hypertonic pelvic floor dysfunction, which means my pelvic floor muscles are unable to fully relax. In addition to painful sex and frequent urination, my specialist said this condition could make getting an IUD put in even more painful. But there was no data or studies to definitively say whether it would be painful for me or not. That was unfortunate, because my only other options were barrier methods like condoms \u2014 which can irritate an already angry \u201cvestibule\u201d \u2014 and the calendar-tracking or \u201cnatural\u201d method, which would never be enough to put my neurotic mind at ease.\nCould getting an IUD really be as bad as I feared? In July 2017, I officially embarked on my quest for a painless insertion \u2014 one that turned out to be frustratingly, though perhaps not surprisingly, byzantine.\nAn IUD placement is typically performed in an OB-GYN\u2019s office, and the entire process takes around five minutes. There are three possible sources of pain during the procedure: the clamp that holds your cervix open, the sound the doctor uses to measure the depth of your uterus, and the insertion of the IUD itself. There is no standardized method for controlling the pain associated with the procedure, but commonly used methods include local numbing injections, ibuprofen, and misoprostol, which is used to soften the cervix. More generous doctors might take pity on you and prescribe a single benzo to help with anxiety and/or a single tramadol to help with pain during and after, but not every doctor will do this.\n\u201cNobody warned me it would hurt so much or offered any pain relief,\u201d said a friend of mine, who compared the insertion to dislocating her knee. She\u2019s had an IUD placed twice, she explained, and \u201cboth places acted like I was a burden for having such a strong reaction to intense pain.\u201d\nFew of the interventions routinely offered by clinicians have been shown to reduce patient pain scores versus placebo. A survey of PubMed literature published in English between 1980 and November 2012 found none of the three most common interventions for IUD placement \u2014 ibuprofen, a cervical block (administered by injection), and the cervix-ripening agent misoprostol \u2014 were effective at reducing the pain of the procedure itself, although it did find that non-steroidal anti-inflammatory agents (NSAIDs) like Advil can help with cramps afterward.\nBased on these findings, the authors concluded that \u201cno prophylactic pharmacological intervention has been adequately evaluated to support routine use for pain reduction during or after IUD insertion.\u201d Their recommendation for what to use instead? The \u201cverbal anesthesia\u201d of pre-procedure counseling. So, talking it out.\nThere is one intervention the authors of studies like these leave out: IV or \u201ctwilight\u201d sedation, which contains a helpful blend of painkillers and anxiety meds. It\u2019s used for numerous other procedures, including oral surgery, colonoscopies, and \u2014 sometimes, if it\u2019s available and the patient opts for it \u2014 abortions. Couldn\u2019t it hypothetically be used for this, too?\nTwo years ago I began my pursuit of a sedated IUD insertion. I decided to forgo asking my usual OB-GYN provider, who had previously compared the discomfort of IUD pain to getting a pedicure. I figured she wouldn\u2019t understand my desire for a pain-free procedure. I called up a local Planned Parenthood, which demurred, then flat-out refused, telling me they simply don\u2019t do IV sedation for IUDs.\nAfter some additional research, I managed to find one doctor in New York City who agreed to do it for me, but his practice set off numerous alarm bells: They only took cash and made me come in for numerous unnecessary tests, including an intensely scrapy pap smear. The last straw came when I asked if the copper IUD was safe for someone with a severe nickel allergy, and he shrugged his shoulders and told me to call the Paragard hotline. Eventually I relented and called my original OB-GYN practice and talked to a different doctor than the one I\u2019d seen before. I explained my situation. \u201cYou can have sedation if you want it,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019ll do it for you, no problem.\u201d He transferred me to the practice\u2019s surgical center, which booked me an appointment for one week later.\nIn the end, the insertion process was totally painless, as I intended it to be; as far as my recollection goes, I went to sleep, then woke up seconds later with a Paragard inside of me. Lying on the table beforehand, I felt a rush of emotions: relief that I was finally getting an IUD and could relax about the risk of unplanned pregnancy, anxiety about whether my insurance would cover the sedation (they told me it would, but you never know), and anger at how many people are not given this option. I was also angry on my own behalf, as I\u2019d been using the pull-out method \u2014 which is an imperfect method for pregnancy prevention \u2014 for more than a year at this point. Why is IV sedation so common for commensurately invasive procedures \u2014 wisdom tooth extraction, for example \u2014 but basically unheard of for IUD insertions?\nIt\u2019s not as though there isn\u2019t a demand for it among people getting IUDs: Dr. Morris Wortman, who runs the Center for Menstrual Disorders and Reproductive Choice in Rochester, New York, and offers IV sedation as a routine option for IUD placement, says 80 to 85% of his IUD patients opt for it. (Although, he cautions, this is not a perfectly representative sample, as some patients are referred from other places specifically for this reason.)\nWortman has been advocating for office-based anesthesia for invasive procedures for decades now. In the 1970s and 1980s, he says, abortions were regularly performed without any analgesics, and he was one of the first physicians in the U.S. to offer IV sedation to his abortion patients. To this day, many abortions in the U.S. are performed with only a paracervical block. Sometimes an oral anxiety medication is also given. For so-called medication abortions, which can feel similar to an early miscarriage, Planned Parenthood recommends Tylenol or Advil.\nWortman sees the question of sedation for an IUD as similar, although not as egregious, as sedation during surgical abortions. He tells me he offers it because \u201cit\u2019s the right thing to do.\u201d\nThis contradicts the stance of most OB-GYN practices. \u201cSedation is not routinely offered for IUD insertions because research has shown that it is not routinely needed and because it increases some risks of the visit,\u201d says Dr. Raegan McDonald-Mosley, chief medical officer at Planned Parenthood Federation of America. \u201cIn some circumstances, it may be possible to make arrangements for a patient who wants or needs sedation \u2014 in those cases, patients will have to speak with a clinician before moving forward with this option.\u201d\nAccording to Wortman, IV sedation is difficult for doctors to provide due to onerous regulations and expenses, as well as poor reimbursement rates from insurance companies. While in-office sedation is technically legal, most doctors cannot afford to meet all the regulatory requirements, which means they must travel to a surgical center and team up with an anesthesiologist. This can make a five-minute-long procedure take more than an hour of the doctor\u2019s time, and that means they lose money. It can also make it massively more expensive for patients\u2014 as I learned when I received a surprise bill for $3,000, which I eventually got covered by fighting my insurer.\nAs any doctor will tell you, there are risks involved any time you go under for a procedure. But it\u2019s a person\u2019s right to evaluate risks and decide between them. For me, the risk of unplanned pregnancy was worse than the risk of a kind of sedation offered routinely for things like wisdom tooth surgery. As someone who\u2019s never been afraid of drugs, I felt safe in the hands of a board-certified anesthesiologist. Other people may decide differently.\nConsidering everything else Americans are up against right now with regard to reproductive rights and healthcare in general, I almost feel guilty for writing this story. Pain management can feel like a luxury when people are still fighting for the right to access abortion, birth control, and any baseline of socially-provided care whatsoever.\nI count myself lucky that I was able to get an IUD at all; most health plans cover them, but they can cost up to $1,300 out of pocket \u2014 and 28 million Americans remain uninsured. I feel lucky that I\u2019ve never had to suffer through a medical abortion with only Tylenol or Advil. I feel lucky that I grew up with the resources to plan when, and if, I want to become a parent. But when I hear horror stories, I\u2019m reminded that the fight for decent healthcare should not be solely about defending the status quo. It should look to a future in which each patient\u2019s needs are valued and prioritized, doctors have the time and energy to listen, and we can choose between the plethora of options modern medicine has to offer us.\n", "link": "https://elemental.medium.com/getting-an-iud-doesnt-have-to-hurt-like-hell-6c45d6089d33", "author": "Jamie Peck", "comments": [], "claps": "1.4K claps"}, {"num_comments": "unspecified", "title": "There Are 2 Types of Hijabs.

In the early 2000\u2019s, Apple even took this debate and turned it into an ad for their MacBook. Apple touts their computers are faster, sleeker, sexier, and don\u2019t get viruses. Wait a minute. Apple devices are not prone to getting malware? Well if that were the case decades ago, it certainly doesn\u2019t hold true today.\nThe truth is Apple is in the top 5 for computer shipments globally. According to a study by the research firm Gartner, Apple ships close to 20 million Mac devices annually. That is a large group of devices running OSX. Additionally, if I were to think like a hacker, I would want to target as many devices as possible. This logical thinking has led to numerous variants of malware being developed for Macs. Still don\u2019t believe me? Well, Trend Micro has a nifty threat Encyclopedia that catalogs known malware for various operating systems. In short, no device is immune to the threat of being targeted by malware.\nOn another note, it is also a myth that anti-virus is only for Windows computers. Anti-virus solutions such as Avast and Symantec Endpoint Protection are available for all platforms, including most versions of Linux. Besides, if Mac computers don\u2019t get malware, then why are these companies releasing their security solutions for them? It would be more prudent to say that Macs have a lower risk of becoming infected due to the lower footprint that exist on the Internet.\nI realize that my argument may not be convincing which is why I am going to settle this debate in true MythBusters style. I will take an old copy of Mac OSX 10.6 Snow Leopard (End-of-Life), and install it on my VirtualBox lab to test whether it can become infected from general use. As an added bonus, I will demonstrate how to properly remove a virus from the Mac should it confirm my first myth.\nWith the virtual Mac environment spun up, I set out to surf the web with reckless abandon, in hopes of having a malicious download find its way onto my computer. Now I\u2019d love to say it didn\u2019t take long to get infected, but truthfully I wasn\u2019t able to get a Trojan to appear so I could download it onto my system. Due to my impatience, I decided to intentionally download a known virus called MacDefender onto my computer. What MacDefender does is pretend to act as a security software. It bypasses the application security settings on Apple devices and then initiates a system scan. The scan itself is fake, but it will then immediately say it found a large number of viruses on your computer. This is what my screen looked like when it completed:\nAs you can see, the malware wants to \u201chelp\u201d by cleaning up all these issues. However, it stops short of that by asking you to register. Those that fall prey end up entering in their email, a password, and their credit card details. The reality is the malware is forwarding that information to the hacker.\nAfter completing the registration, I was able to click on cleanup. What it was actually doing was creating processes that further infected the machine. I noticed my performance begin to slow down as a result. Ultimately, I was able to prove that the Mac VM could contract a virus contrary to previous advertisement claims.\nTo go deeper, I now need to remove the malware. These directions will also help should anybody become a victim of malware on current Mac operating systems. To accomplish this, follow the listed steps in order:\nIn summary, I must say that Apple devices are incredibly resilient. While Windows operating systems will often become corrupt and require a fresh installation to fix, Macintosh was able to heal itself after I removed the offending software and rebooted. Nevertheless, it appears that this myth has been officially busted. The Mac VM was able to contract a virus, but I was also able to effectively remove it.\nI hope you all enjoyed this proof of concept I put together.

You can text Bank of America at 692632. While banks today offer text-first tools for checking your account balance, Apple is the first I\u2019ve seen to integrate customer service into this channel. A gold star for them, I guess. I\u2019m really trying here.\nThis is the first actual cool thing. About half of all credit card fraud claims are due to \u201cunrecognized charges\u201d\u2014many of which are actually just people forgetting what they\u2019ve purchased because they don\u2019t recognize how it\u2019s listed on the bill. Mint.com and dozens of other finance trackers have attempted to categorize spending data, but it all sucks.\nApple has a clear opportunity here to differentiate their card from other providers. I\u2019m honestly surprised it didn\u2019t launch a budget tracker alongside its new credit card. If you\u2019re already categorizing the transactions (which is very hard), why not add a \u201cgoal\u201d for each category?\nThis is just... fine? Flat cash back on a wide variety of categories, combined with Apple\u2019s privacy-first ethos that disqualifies the sale of any of the spending data to data brokers or other tech companies and incentivizes daily use for every category all means Apple wants to be your \u201cEverything Card.\u201d But if Apple actually wants to be your everything card, why not actually compete with the other everything cards?\nMaybe I over-optimize for credit card points. Maybe it\u2019s all a sick, twisted game we credit card churners play, reading through subreddits and blogs to squeeze out an extra percentage back on a $20 dinner. But asking mostly affluent, financially-savvy people to give up their beloved Amex Platinum or Chase Sapphire Reserve for the \u201cbest Everything Card\u201d is a tough ask, especially when the perks and social status associated with having an elite credit card made the New York Times.\nApple had the unique opportunity to completely destroy the entire credit card industry, and it looks like it\u2019s about to blow it. Credit cards\u2014and the banking system at large\u2014are inherently racist and regressive, holding back millions of Americans from financial freedom. African Americans are given worse credit ratings than white people; 26 million \u201ccredit invisible\u201d U.S. citizens are ignored by banks their entire lives because their parents couldn\u2019t afford to co-sign their first credit card.\nCredit cards hide racism in their rewards programs. The credit cards used by the financially privileged\u2014the Amex Platinum, Chase Sapphire Reserve, to name a few\u2014charge higher interchange fees to businesses in order to be able to afford generous cash-back programs for their mostly white users. People who use cash, debit cards, or less-exclusionary credit cards\u2014the least financially privileged among us\u2014cost businesses less money. The interchange fees on these cards can be as little as 25% of the more expensive cards (or nothing for cash). When accepting thousands of dollars every day, these interchange fees add up quickly, to the point where businesses are forced to increase prices for everyone to support the privilege of the few.\nCredit cards are a regressive sales tax on society, fueled by financial illiteracy. Apple had the opportunity to wipe this practice out, offering the same perks\u20142% cash back, a fancy metal card\u2014to the many millions of financially impoverished people in the United States. Unfortunately, while a number of the Apple Card features, like no late fees, clearer interest payment scheduling, and a competitive cash back rewards program, are certainly are a step in the right direction, not a single second of the 15-minute announcement was dedicated to the process that Goldman Sachs and Apple will use to approve users.\nMy guess: It\u2019ll be more of the same, with Goldman Sachs excluding users based on credit scores and opaque algorithms. Apple hasn\u2019t given any indication it\u2019ll play a role in deciding which applicants are approved. Its advertised \u201clow interest rates\u201d are essentially industry standard.\nApple and Goldman Sachs built an Everything Card; 2% cash back on Apple Pay purchases and 1% back on purchases with the card is fine, and you can expect millions will use their Apple Card to charge all their purchases. But even with the resources of the world\u2019s second-most valuable company, Apple didn\u2019t do a great job.\nApple could have built the Everyone Card, democratizing access to the financial privileges of the elite.\nApple could have designed the entire card around a savings and budgeting product designed to educate users about investing for retirement.\nApple could have launched a credit card debt refinancer, bringing everybody\u2019s debt under one roof with a lower interest rate paid off with one straightforward payment every month.\nApple could have offered to support cash and check deposits directly in Apple Wallet, killing the predatory payday loan industry and helping bank the tens of millions among us that don\u2019t qualify for a traditional bank account. Cash App and Simple are already working toward this.\nApple could have announced that any iPhone owner would be eligible for the card, regardless of their credit score, using secured deposits on your Apple Pay as collateral for lines of credit to those society has deemed \u201cunworthy.\u201d\nApple could have broken the regressive tax of credit card rewards, locking everybody into an iPhone for life in the process.\nDon\u2019t get me wrong; some of these product decisions are certainly a step in the right direction, but for one of the world\u2019s most valuable companies, it feels like Apple\u2019s attempt fell short at the hands of fear. Fear of what exactly, I don\u2019t know.\n", "link": "https://onezero.medium.com/the-apple-card-a-missed-opportunity-e286f9970b97", "author": "Nick Abouzeid", "comments": ["Very interesting perspectives and awesome piece!

I will give you optimal defaults and then trust you to make an adult decision about whether that default is right for you.\nIn addition, because this is a long post, I\u2019ve written it in a way to make it easier to skim. Here\u2019s how to read the post:\nAs a bonus, because I know you got excited when you saw this was a seventy minute read, I\u2019ve gone all out on getting pedantic about productivity and even included three appendixes to give an overview of the behavior design principles, to break out the potential financial budget for implementing this advice, and then a real-world example from my own phone.\nAlso, for convenience, here is a clickable table of contents. (The links below work if you\u2019re reading in a browser, but not if you\u2019re reading in the app.)\nOpen the Apple Settings App, then go to the Notifications Section. You\u2019re going to need to get good at opening the Settings app, so learn to find this icon:\nGo app by app, turning off all notifications.\nBy the end, the vast majority of your apps should have a notifications setting that looks like this, i.e with no notifications:\nThere are only a very few reasons to leave notifications on for a particular app. Here are those reasons:\nI led with this advice to turn off notifications because it\u2019s the most powerful. Also, you\u2019re never going to finish reading this post if you leave your notifications turned on.\nThese are the productivity reasons that should make you wary of notifications.\n#1: Notifications are uncontrolled interruptions from your real goals. They prevent you from ever getting into a flow state. You should be in control of what you do and when \u2014 not your phone. I\u2019m going to refer to this over and over as \u201cyour phone is a tool, not a boss.\u201d See Appendix A at the end of this article for more.\n#2: The brain science behind learning requires sustained focus to trigger myelin growth around active neural pathways. That\u2019s what brain plasticity is about. However, if you go around interrupting that process, you\u2019ll never get the myelin growth that locks in whatever you were learning. Essentially, notifications lead to a stunted life.\n#3: Those red dots cause anxiety, and anxiety causes health problems like heart disease. It\u2019s not hyperbole that I talked about life expectancy in the title of this post. Not specific to red dots, but mild anxiety was shown to increase mortality by 20% over a ten year period.\n\u2018Slot machine apps\u2019 is a pejorative phrase to refer to apps that use variable rate rewards to try to trigger mindless and addictive behavior. That\u2019s how the app tries to become your boss \u2014 although maybe boss isn\u2019t even a strong enough word. These are virtual drugs and due to societal oversight, your dealer (Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, Snapchat) is allowed to pose as a respectable member of society.\nThankfully, you can configure all of your social media to eliminate the addictive elements.\nThis last trick comes from Tristan Harris.\nHere\u2019s what I mean. When your addictions are in the first screen of a folder, they\u2019re still visibly calling out to you. Still bad:\nInstead, move your apps to the second screen of that folder, like so (the first screen has just one app, the second screen has the rest):\nThis second-screen-of-folder-on-second-screen strategy requires that at least one app be visible. When you reach this decision point for social media apps, you obviously should choose LinkedIn. It\u2019s the least addictive.\nExtra credit for people that are actual productivity nuts: just delete all your social media apps.\nThis is the same strategy as #2, just for messaging apps. Messaging apps also have a built-in variable rate reward \u2014 that\u2019s what makes them slot machines.\nThe productivity secret for inbox management is to decide when you want to check your messages. Then, process them all in one big batch. Batch processing puts you in control. Unfortunately, most people live life reactively, constantly checking their inboxes for messages to react to. For you to reach your full potential, you need to switch to a batch processing mindset for all of your inboxes.\nThese messaging apps should never interrupt you. This goes back to the brain science justification in #1. You want to block off your day so that you have some contiguous time dedicated to being smart and creative (no interruptions) and then other blocks dedicated to rapid task processing (email, etc.). Cal Newport calls this Deep Work (in a very good book).\nProductivity nuts: consider deleting all of these apps. People who set a schedule for when and where they check their inboxes often realize they can do all of their emailing from a proper computer. For Slack users, private messages and channel notifications are meant to be asynchronous \u2014 that means you don\u2019t need immediate alerts.\nYou open an app intending to get work done, and then that app prompts you to leave a review. This is an unwanted interruption, and your job is to remove as many interruptions as possible.\nSo disable these unwanted Review Requests.\nIs it crazy how we think of computers as productivity devices but then allow so many unproductive features? I think it\u2019s crazy. This isn\u2019t just some app-developer hack, it\u2019s actually a built-in feature provided by Apple. That\u2019s how blind Apple is to the damage caused by interrupting your work flow.\nWhat\u2019s happening with review requests is that when you use free apps, you are actually entering a partnership with the app developer where you are working on their behalf, often by clicking on advertisements, or in the case of app reviews, by acting as marketing.\nApps with more positive reviews get ranked higher by Apple. As a consequence, app developers tend to interrupt you with review requests just as you\u2019re doing something productive.\nDo you care about the morality of opting out of this partnership? A savvy user can often leach off of the hard work of app developers and the money of investors without giving anything back. I\u2019ve been doing that with the MoviePass service \u2014 seeing twice as many movies as I paid for, all subsidized by some venture capital investors. (Unfortunately, that gravy train seems to be ending.)\nWhen you or I do take advantage, we\u2019re basically stealing. This sort of stealing is not illegal, but is it bad for your health? The impact off morality on longevity is muddy. As close as I could find was research on religious vs. non-religious people within the same country.\nIf you\u2019re worried about the effect of morality on your longevity, here a few workarounds. Manually go to the App Store, look through your recently updated apps, and add reviews to each of them. Share your favorite apps with your friends (as I\u2019m doing in this post). Or, opt for the pro or paid versions. I\u2019m finding that I almost always prefer to pay for an app.\nMost people should have their phone permanently on Do Not Disturb.\nDo Not Disturb is not as severe as you might think, thanks to a sub-feature to \u201cAllow Calls From Favorites.\u201d As a result, you can still allow certain people to interrupt you or wake you up.\nThe trick to getting the Do Not Disturb feature to work all day is to turn it on from the same time to the same time, such as from 9am to 9am. I tested it and that works (I was worried it would effectively turn itself on and off again in the same minute).\nIf, however, you do want strangers to be able to contact you (for example, if you work in sales), then just set Do Not Disturb for your sleep and leisure time.\nThe justification here is similar to the steps above. Limited interruptions is smart for a number of reasons, including the science of brain plasticity, the health impact of anxiety, and the productivity gains of optimizing for deep work (all covered in more depth in Appendix A below).\nWhat the above Do Not Disturb setting allows you to do is to take a \u2018whitelist\u2019 strategy to interruptions. So rather than banning telemarketers one-by-one (\u2018blacklisting\u2019), you pre-select the very limited number of people who you would allow to interrupt your day. For me, that\u2019s my immediate family, my dog walker, and my dog\u2019s vet.\nThe absolute best wallpaper is an all black background. Choosing black destroys the idea that your phone is some shiny toy that you need to be looking at all the time.\nPlus, with OLED screens (most new iPhones), black actually saves battery (as much as 60%). If you chronically run out of battery or are a true productivity nut, then black is the best option for you.\nIf you can\u2019t stomach making a thousand dollar phone look that ugly, choose the black with rainbow stripe option that\u2019s right next to the black option in the Stills. That\u2019s what I\u2019ve done for all the screen shots in this article.\nThere are other options:\nIf you\u2019re shy, choose a wallpaper that will help as a conversation starter.\nIf you find inspirational images inspiring:\nOne problem with inspirational images is that words often make your phone feel cluttered. It\u2019s better to have an image, like a mountain or a person working out, than it is to have a quote or motivational phrase. For example, here\u2019s a reasonable set of affirmations that just don\u2019t show up well behind various iPhone icons and widgets.\nIf you are going to have affirmation or motivational text, a quick hack is to make the background yourself in Instagram Stories. Instagram will let you save the Story to your phone\u2019s Photos.\nIn this case, try to stick to just a single word, and place that word low enough that it shows up below your Do-Not-Disturb message. If you take this approach, consider two things:\nHere\u2019s an example Jonathan Howard sent me when he was reviewing a draft of this article:\nIf you still haven\u2019t found a suitable strategy, pick an image with a dominant color that tells a color story to prompt one of the below emotions.\nDon\u2019t pick orange (cheap) or yellow (warning). If you\u2019re not sure? Pick Red. All of these color choices will drain your battery more than a black background, but you may find the emotional gain to be worthwhile.\nThe reality for me is that I alternate between a black background and a meaningful picture. There\u2019s some possible science supporting the value of small changes to your work environment to create a boost in productivity. Unfortunately, I can\u2019t find a citation, although I\u2019m 90% certain I read this in David Rock\u2019s Your Brain at Work. The theory is basically that shaking up your environment a small amount puts your brain on alert (but not so much that you\u2019re anxious).\nThe Raise to Wake feature lets you quickly see notifications on your lock screen just by lifting your phone.\nThis is a bad idea. You don\u2019t want to accidentally see notifications on your lock screen when you just happen to be moving your phone around. You want only see notifications intentionally.\nWinners check their notifications on their own schedule.\nThis is yet another setting to make sure you\u2019re the boss and your phone is your tool.\nThe Screen Time widget is new from Apple and it helps show you where your time is going. Ideally, the Social Media category will be non-existent. Unsurprisingly, I\u2019m not going to be able to find a screen shot where that is true.\nTo install the Screen Time widget:\nYou\u2019re going to use this widget as a reality check against your own biased memory.\nThis article is going to recommend a few more widgets later, and then recommend that you build the habit of checking the Today View by swiping right from your home screen (conceptually, it lives to the left of your home screen).\nIt does seem to be roughly true that what gets measured gets done. There are a number of variants of that quote, but my favorite is \u201cWhat gets measured gets done, what gets measured and fed back gets done well, what gets rewarded gets repeated.\u201d\nA goal for many of the steps in this article is for you to use your phone less, and to use social media apps much, much less.\nThis widget is how you\u2019ll know if you\u2019re succeeding. I consider it the feedback part of the above quote. Then hopefully the reward is an intrinsic satisfaction in your own life and productivity.\nIn addition to installing the widget, you should set yourself a goal for social media usage. Imagine you had a child and were setting a limit for how much television they could watch each day. Is one hour reasonable? Probably. Is six hours reasonable? No.\nNow, instead of this child, consider instead that you are setting limits for yourself, and that social media has replaced your television watching time. How much \u201cleisure\u201d time each day do you think is appropriate for yourself? If you\u2019re not sure, choose thirty minutes. That\u2019s enough time to scan your Facebook and Instagram, drop tons of likes on your friends, tweet once, get the gist of the news, and consume a huge dose of We Rate Dogs.\nSometimes it\u2019s helpful to block yourself from certain websites. I have zero pride preventing me from treating myself like a toddler in need of parental controls. The reality is that we all could use some strict blocks to prevent our worst habits.\nOn the iPhone, the feature to block specific websites is hidden inside of Apple\u2019s Limit Adult Websites feature.\nI\u2019m not trying to make any point at all about your adult website usage. I just want to help you find the feature (and it\u2019s the most deeply buried feature in this article).\nTurning on this feature allows you to then add specific websites, which don\u2019t have to be adult websites at all.\nWhat you should consider is whether you have any habitual behaviors around checking specific websites and then use this feature to break those habits. For example, I used to live in San Francisco and so had a habit of checking the website for the daily paper. That\u2019s the one site I block because I don\u2019t want to have that habit anymore.\nAdditionally, I was a huge Grantland reader before it was shut down by ESPN. I still type that URL into my browser just out of pure muscle memory.\nIf I were designing content restrictions for productivity, I\u2019d have one called Google-only, which would allow you to Google any term and then click any result. But you\u2019d be blocked from going directly to any sites or clicking deeper into any site.\nHowever, since I\u2019m not the boss at Apple, the solution above is the best available approach and is probably ideal for most people. I\u2019ll give a more hardcore solution next.\nNone of you are going to do this... but I tried a month with no access to a web browser. If you are up for this, I definitely want to hear from you.\nThe theory is that the browser is one of the addictive slot machines that draws your attention and wastes your time.\nSo I used parental controls to disable Safari.\nIn practice, I would very occasionally need a web browser, so I\u2019d download the Chrome app, do my browsing, and then delete the Chrome app.\nIf this method of reclaiming your phone at all appeals to you, here\u2019s the secret:\nWhen I tested this, I used Chrome as my occasional browser because the path for removing access again was shorter. I trusted myself more to delete the Chrome app than to remember to find the Safari restriction option that\u2019s hidden behind five taps.\nThere are four ways to organize your apps: by function, by color, by random chance, and alphabetically.\nYou\u2019re going to organize your screens by function, and you\u2019re also going to organize apps into folders by function. The home screen is for tools only. The second screen is apps organized into folders. The third screen is for junk, namely Apple apps you aren\u2019t allowed to remove.\nHowever, on each screen and within each folder you have to make additional decisions about organizing. You should choose alphabetically.\nThe phrase \u201cyour phone is a tool, not your boss\u201d is implying that you\u2019re the boss. But it\u2019s more subtle than that.\nWe want to set your phone up so that your rational brain is the boss, and your emotional, addictive, worst-decisions brain is asleep or blocked.\nThe best explanation for this is in the book, Thinking, Fast and Slow (or just read the NYT book review for a good overview). The author lays out a model for the brain as having two systems.\nThe Fast system is our default. It\u2019s effortless, instinctual, and functional for staying alive, but also the source of most of our worst impulses. It\u2019s the system that likes slot machine apps.\nThe Slow system is what we think of as our rational brain. It\u2019s analytical, but requires effort and intention to access.\nWhen I train meditation in my Heavy Mental program, I train a verbal way of moving the thoughts that come up during a meditation into our Slow system. That way we can analyze the thought, and then drop it. The entire trick is that activating your language center always activates your Slow system.\nHere, we\u2019re doing something very similar. When you go for an app, I want you to have the actual name of the app in mind. That way it\u2019s easier for you to be acting rationally and intentionally. That\u2019s the main reason to adopt an alphabetical organizing structure.\nThe second good reason is that alphabetical is less brittle. Organizing by function is hard because sometimes apps have more than one function. Organizing by app name is intellectually trivial in comparison.\nFor the vast majority of people, the ideal phone setup is to embrace Google Cloud services (mail, calendar, photos, maps) and pair them with Apple hardware.\nIf you\u2019re on some other setup, like Apple email or Outlook, then stick with that. It\u2019s not worth switching.\nYou can often configure the Apple apps to connect to the Google services. But it\u2019s always better to just use the Google-specific app. In this case, I\u2019m going to talk about Gmail.\nDon\u2019t use Apple\u2019s Mail product. Google\u2019s actual Gmail app just works more smoothly, especially search.\nAnd don\u2019t bother with any app that promises any sort of \u201csmart\u201d filtering or sorting of your email. Relying on somebody else\u2019s algorithms is hugely overrated.\nI hosted a Q&A with Marshall Hughes, who is our most prolific Inbox Zero coach. Yes, that\u2019s a type of coach \u2014 a lot of our coaches zero (do you like my pun?) in on specific behavior changes.\nIn the Q&A, everyone wanted to ask Marshall about email automation tools. And Marshall was adamant that every experience he had with clients using automation tools turned out badly. Clients who chose automation were bailing on essential inbox habits. They\u2019d given up on the most important habit of all, which is to say no to email by constantly unsubscribing and manually filtering.\nSo, paired with the settings above, you should be working on your email habits. That means primarily unsubscribing and blocking aggressively. I get a lot of extra email too that I consider FYI \u2014 for example, I like having a history of all of the newsletters we send out, but I don\u2019t need to read each one as they come in to my inbox. I filter those into folders and only check those folders occasionally.\nSticking with the Google Cloud theme, use the native Google Calendar app and ignore Apple\u2019s Calendar app.\nThe two most important subtleties are trying to shorten meetings and building a Today screen that\u2019s worthy of a daily habit.\nThe Today habit is just you starting your day by getting a summary of what\u2019s planned (and later, what the weather is like). If you can build this habit, then you can use it to trigger new habits.\nIn the Tiny Habits method, checking your calendar would be called an anchor habit. Above in the Screen Time section, I\u2019ve already attached a new, not-quite-natural habit of checking your Screen Time widget. The reason I think that will work is because I trust that you will naturally want to check the calendar and weather, thus triggering the new and less natural habit of checking additional widgets.\nOn the short meetings front, this is literally a chance to save yourself hours each day by making the meetings you go to shorter and more focused. The key to focus is to have a clear goal, and push directly toward that goal.\nI have one friend, a CEO, who wants the time on his calendar to be as precious as the time on a U.S. president\u2019s schedule (he told me this during a different administration). If a meeting only needs seven minutes, then just give it seven minutes. A different friend, also a CEO, set a company policy that if a meeting invite didn\u2019t include goals, an agenda, and pre-meeting preparation, you could skip it. The acronym there is GAP \u2014 no GAP, no need to attend.\nLast, in my screenshot there\u2019s a massive amount of time blocked off called \u201cReserved.\u201d I\u2019m unapologetic about scheduling time on my calendar for deep work. You can\u2019t squeeze deep work into fifteen minute gaps \u2014 you need to carve out contiguous blocks of time. For most office workers, I use what Cal Newport calls a \u201cbi-modal day.\u201d That\u2019s where half of my day is for deep work and the other is for shallow work, i.e. meetings, email, phone calls.\nApple Maps has gotten better, but it\u2019s still not as good as Google Maps. You\u2019re only going to use Apple Maps when you use Siri (it\u2019s Siri\u2019s permanent default).\nEvery other time, you\u2019re going to use Google Maps.\nThis is yet another example of preferring the Google Cloud. And the custom settings for Home and Work are just small time-savers. There\u2019s not a huge additional productivity explanation.\nThis will let you type faster through swiping. The world record for typing on a phone is set through the swipe method: just swipe your finger over the letters of the word you\u2019re trying to type. The keyboard will figure out what you mean.\nAt first this will feel a little uncomfortable, but it will quickly become second nature.\nGboard, from Google, also has a bunch more features too like GIF and emoji search.\nI found that I was so unhappy with the Apple keyboard peck-typing that I\u2019d avoid using it altogether. I\u2019m a fast laptop typist, so I\u2019d always postpone writing until I got to my desk.\nNow, with swiping, I\u2019m just a little bit faster and that\u2019s the difference between not typing anything and being willing to type a longer message.\nWhere that ties into productivity is what a lot of people call the \u201ctouch it once\u201d principle. Especially with email, you want to avoid reading the same email twice. So if I happen to read a message that needs a response, I want to give that response right away.\nThis is the last of the settings to use the Google Cloud over Apple\u2019s built-in options.\nThe main benefit of Google Photos is that the search is amazing. They use machine learning to categorize all of your photos so that you can later search them. For example, without any work I can find all my selfies by just searching for the word me. And I often pull up pictures of my dogs by searching for dog. I have even had someone pull up photos of a specific handcrafted greenland kayak paddle.\nFor photos, take the following steps.\nI end up storing my photos in four places: Google photos, iCloud, laptop and Dropbox sync. That\u2019s because I\u2019m paranoid. I should probably take them out of Dropbox.\nOf those, Google Photos is far and away the best experience for looking at my photos, thanks to the machine learning behind Google\u2019s search. This is an example of where a messy-by-design organization structure beats rigid one. Search is more reliable and faster than you trying to manually categorize every photo.\nIf you already love your note taking app and to-do list app, then fine, stick with those. This is a recommendation where habits beat tools. Don\u2019t switch if you already have strong habits.\nHowever, if you don\u2019t use a note taking app or to-do list app, or are unhappy with what you do use, let me give you a guiding theory that will lead you to Evernote: go messy and trust search.\nPut your to-do list in Evernote, either by creating one long note that you edit every day or a new note for each day. Then put all your other notes in Evernote too. Don\u2019t bother particularly with categorization. Instead, just trust that you\u2019ll be able to find whatever you want later through Evernote\u2019s search.\nWhat you end up with is a messy but long-term functional system. The other approach, constantly switching apps, systems, and categorization schemes always breaks. Always.\nOne power of a messy to-do list is that not everything has to be a check list item. You can mix in quick drafts and longer notes to yourself. Or, as I\u2019ve recommended in my Interstitial Journaling technique, to live mindfully, you should literally intermix short journal entries and to-do list items.\nThe problem with most productivity systems is that they break. As a result, a lot of productivity nuts spend a lot of their time creating new productivity systems over and over again. This, obviously, is not productive.\nFor that reason, where possible, I suggest that you choose messy systems over rigid systems. The ultimate messy system that I know you\u2019re all familiar with is the paper notebook. A paper notebook gives you incredible flexibility: you can take notes however you want, write drafts, sketch outlines, draw pictures, write to-do lists, etc. A to-do list app just doesn\u2019t allow for that.\nThe downside to paper notebooks is that it\u2019s impossible (or at least very hard) to find an old note.\nAll of that is the argument for merging your to-do lists with your notes, and then putting them all into a single cloud-backed note taking system with good search features.\nAlthough Evernote has advanced features that may or (probably) may not be a pleasure to use, the basics work well and reliably. I recommend starting with free and then upgrading ($60/year) if you bump into a limit on bandwidth or offline availability.\nI learned to meditate from Headspace. That\u2019s a good option. But guided meditation is something that you\u2019ll graduate from quickly. Most people I know who meditate don\u2019t still need a daily guide.\nOnce you graduate to meditating on your own, Calm is the much better option because of their built-in timer and tracking. I was an advisor in the early days of Calm specifically because of my experience building habit tracking apps.\nMeditation is a productivity and performance practice. The explanation for why is a little long, so I\u2019m mostly just going to point you to longer articles we\u2019ve published in Better Humans. However, here\u2019s the quick pitch for why the Calm app is about performance and not just \u201ccalm.\u201d\nA lot of people talk about meditation as a relaxing or spiritual practice. That\u2019s fine for them. But you\u2019re reading a productivity article, so I\u2019m focused on what meditation does for your productivity.\nThe core concept comes from the world of deliberate practice, which is when you identify the components of skills that are important to your success, and then practice those components individually. I want you to approach meditation as a practice session for a skill that you\u2019re going to use to help your productivity.\nYou should read our full article on Deliberate Practice to get a feel for how to design practice for all important life skills.\nWith meditation, you\u2019re practicing a two-step process that you will use outside of the meditation. The first step is becoming aware of where your mind wandered, acknowledging the thought and then putting the thought down. Call that Awareness. The second step is bringing your focus back to your point of focus (usually your breath). Call that Focus.\nThis Awareness-Focus loop is what you are practicing during a meditation session. A lot of people feel bad if their mind wanders during meditation. But you should actually feel good. The more often your mind wanders, the more times you get to practice this Awareness-Focus loop. I tell people what they are doing is mental pushups. The more wandering they do, the more pushups they get in.\nNow that you\u2019ve practiced, here\u2019s a way to then apply the Awareness-Focus loop in ways to be more productive by beating procrastination.\nThere are basically two philosophies for how to use a goal tracker. Both involve picking a set of small goals or habits and marking them off in the app each time you do them.\nIn the Quantified Self philosophy of goal trackers, you are tracking your goals simply out of curiosity because you want to get more information about yourself. (The word Goal in Goal Tracker doesn\u2019t even come into play.)\nThe second philosophy is focused on a goal-oriented behavior-change mindset where you are using the goal tracker for motivation and accountability in order to get yourself to adopt a new behavior and become a better person.\nI simply do not understand the Quantified Self philosophy \u2014 don\u2019t they want to improve? Every time I go to a Quantified Self event, I feel like I\u2019m surrounded by aliens who love data but not growth.\nIt just doesn\u2019t make sense.\nSo my goal tracker recommendation is for a goal tracker I built. It is the foundation of the Coach.me community. Most users and most coaches started out by forming habits through this goal tracking app.\nInstall the Coach.me app and consider tracking a few of the 101 most tracked habits in 2018.\nObviously, I\u2019m talking from my own book here. This article is the product of prior work that started with this goal tracker and then morphed into coaching and personal development publishing. There are many links out there to projects we built at Coach.me or articles we published at Better Humans.\nSo, with the caveat that I\u2019m deeply biased, my position is that I\u2019ve seen all the other goal trackers and generally they all use similar formulas and then differentiate just a tiny bit on what graphs they show you.\nHowever, we put every ounce of our design effort into something different: your psychology and motivation. That includes how we trigger reminders, how we try to avoid triggering guilt, how we introduce variable rate rewards for your own good, and how we handle when a goal is too challenging for you.\nIf you\u2019ve read this far in the article, I think you will have picked up on my philosophy, which is that I want to see results.\nTrying to remember hundreds of passwords is a waste of time. Using the same password for all your accounts is the fast track to getting hacked.\nThere are a number of good third-party password managers that are much easier to use than Apple\u2019s built in Keychain. If you are already using one, then stick with it. This is a principle (covered also in Appendix A) that habits are more important than tools. The benefits of your habits around your current password manager outweigh the feature benefits of switching to a different manager.\nI use 1Password but that\u2019s not what I\u2019m going to recommend to you. I signed up with them a long time ago when they had a pay-once option. But now they\u2019ve moved to a subscription model that\u2019s quite a bit more expensive than other better options.\nSo, if you are looking to use a password manager for the first time, then install LastPass. It\u2019s the probably best for most people and definitely the least expensive at $24/year.\nDownload LastPass here. You\u2019re going to need to set it up in three places: as an app on your phone, as an app on your computer, and as an extension in your computer\u2019s web browser.\nOn your iPhone, you\u2019ll also need to configure LastPass to fill passwords in Safari. Select your password manager from iOS Settings > Passwords & Accounts > Autofill Passwords.\nThe theory behind the value of a password manager comes down to pragmatic security and reduced cognitive load.\nYour parents used to memorize people\u2019s phone numbers. Now nobody does that anymore. It should be the same with passwords \u2014 you have better things to remember. That\u2019s a cognitive load reduction.\nPlus, password managers can save time. A common trap is to half-way embrace unique passwords for each app or site, but then find yourself constantly forgetting and having to go through a lost-password routine. This is wasted time.\nOn the security front, most people who don\u2019t use a password manager end up reusing passwords. So when a hacker gets your password to one site, they get it for all sites. Password managers aren\u2019t immune to getting hacked either, but at least if you use a popular one you\u2019re likely to hear about it when the hack happens.\nAfter accuracy, the must-have feature for calculators is a history. Otherwise you\u2019re going to make a typo and not notice.\nUnfortunately, Apple\u2019s calculator does not ship with a history feature. So:\nNotice the second line of numbers at the top? That\u2019s a history. Having that history saves you time and reduces your errors because you can spot when you\u2019ve fat-fingered an entry. Reduce your anxiety and live longer.\n\u201cEven people displaying minor symptoms of psychological distress were found to have a 20 percent increased risk of dying over the 10-year study period.\u201d (This is the same citation I used in the section about turning off notifications.)\nTechnically, this is quadruply redundant.\nYou can swipe down to get the camera from your control center, tap the camera on the lock screen, or swipe left from your lock screen.\nThat last, swipe-left from the lock screen is really convenient. Practice that. But also add the camera to your toolbar.\nThe camera is a great tool for happiness and gratitude. I\u2019m not talking about preening in front of the camera all day. I\u2019m talking about capturing the most interesting moments of your day for posterity and to share with others.\nUsing your camera regularly also helps you develop an eye for detail.\nThe general theme of this article is to set your phone up to be more present in the world. Looking for pictures to take is one way to be more engaged with your surroundings. Stopping a meal so that you can capture your food, however, is not the path to living in the moment.\nIf you are wanting to post pictures to Instagram and Facebook, you can consider the placement of the Camera app to be a replacement habit that allows you to schedule your social media usage. Take a picture in the Camera app and then post it later, during your allotted leisure window.\nWhat does 70% chance of rain mean? Sometimes it means there\u2019s a 70% chance of rain over 100% of your area. But it can also mean there is 100% certainty of rain, but only over part of your 70% of your area.\nThat\u2019s confusing. And so the only sane way to check the weather is to compare it to the Doppler radar. These radars visualize the rain and the direction that the rain is heading. That way you can eyeball for yourself if the rain is actually going to affect you.\nDownload the NOAA Radar app.\nWhile you\u2019re setting up weather, you should place this Doppler app on your home screen, and then go to your Today screen and turn on Apple\u2019s Weather widget.\nA big part of productivity is planning. You\u2019ve heard a million people complain about how inaccurate weather forecasting is. So here\u2019s the solution: be your own forecaster.\nThe idea behind Pomodoro is to be fully focused for a set period of time, usually twenty-five minutes, and then have a five minute break.\nThis is a way to train yourself to avoid procrastination. You end up constantly pushing yourself a little bit harder to make it to the end of your work period, knowing that you\u2019ll get a short reward after.\nThe rules of Pomodoro aren\u2019t complicated, but it\u2019s still nice to have a dedicated app. There are two good ones, but I prefer BeFocused Pro for $2.99 because it can easily categorize your Pomodoros. For example, I\u2019m currently in a Pomodoro that I marked for the Writing category.\nWhen do you use Pomodoro? It\u2019s useful for when you are doing individual work, like checking your email or working on a project. You wouldn\u2019t use this method during a meeting.\nThis is one of a handful of strategies in this article for beating procrastination. My intention is that you use all of them at once. For example, the Meditation section is mostly focused on meditation as training that allows you to catch and overcome the feelings that lead to procrastination.\nPomodoro comes at procrastination from a different perspective. It makes for a smaller, more achievable goal. A lot of people get down on themselves if they can\u2019t go an entire 8-hour work day without procrastinating. Pomodoro helps you set a more achievable goal, say 25 minutes. And if that\u2019s too long, make your Pomodoro even shorter. You can always start small and build up to your final goal.\n(The third main strategy for beating procrastination is next \u2014 using Brain.fm for background noise.)\nA lot of people have trained themselves to listen to music while they work. But almost all research says that performance is poorer in the presence of a background sound.\nOne obvious benefit, though, of music is social. You put on your headphones and people know not to bother you. I often wear headphones with no sound just to indicate to my coworkers that I\u2019m busy.\nThe research, however, on music as a background noise is that it\u2019s tricky \u2014 there are occasional benefits to productivity but also many, many pitfalls. There is another approach: an emerging field of auditory science used to boost focus and reduce mind-wandering.\nBrain.fm is the best of these brain music options.\nSince I come from the world of coaching, I spend most of my time helping people apply behavior changes. As a result, I often end up in a place where I think I see certain advice working, but I don\u2019t necessarily understand or trust the scientific explanation for why that advice works. That\u2019s the case with Brain.fm.\nMy experience with Brain.fm is that it\u2019s amazing and works exactly as advertised. Sometimes, without sound, my brain will have a tendency to wander. With the Brain.fm focus music, it some how shuts down that wandering during any dead spots in my work (like if I\u2019m waiting for an app to load). As a result, I have more sustained periods of focus.\nHowever, I find their explanation of the science to be inscrutable. It sounds exactly like the type of pop-culture brain science that lots of people spout. This doesn\u2019t bother me, as long as it works.\nHowever, Brain.fm have run studies funded by the National Science Foundation that back up my experience, which is that Brain.fm is better than silence and silence is better than music.\nI need to emphasize that this is a corporate-run study that magically ended up with a self-serving result. So, more than the science, I just want you to take my word for it enough to try it out for yourself (remember, there\u2019s a free trial).\nYour podcast app should be on your home screen and you should train yourself to listen to podcasts during your commute, while cleaning, and during light cardio.\nIf you listen to podcasts on the bus or subway, here\u2019s an important, little-known fact. It\u2019s preferable to just listen! You don\u2019t also have to be playing games and scrolling Instagram. Be a single-tasker.\nThe below are where most people should start when it comes to productivity and health podcasts.\nOf course, Tim Ferriss is on this list. But I rounded him out so that you get a diverse set of ideas and approaches.\nDo not approach your podcast subscriptions as if you need to listen to every episode. Instead, pick and choose the most recent episodes that feel relevant to you.\nI\u2019ve never heard anyone who shares my reasoning for why and how to listen to productivity and health podcasts. Most people just think having more information is inherently good. That\u2019s not my reason.\nInformation is never enough for making important changes. You need to get emotionally hooked, amped up and committed. The podcast format gives you a chance to connect with advice at an emotional level and really feel the social proof. That matters.\nSecond, most advice only works for some people some of the time. I\u2019ve written before that you should approach personal development advice as if it only has a 10% success rate. The obvious implication is that you\u2019ll always be needing to try lots of approaches until you find the one that works for you. Given that observation, it feels entirely natural to me that you would listen to both Jocko Willink and Gretchen Rubin.\nDo not bother with cliff notes. There\u2019s more value in being a slow reader, where the stories in the book can work on your emotions, and where your brain can roam freely to make connections between the words and your own world. So skip book summary apps like Blinklist, and embrace reading on the Kindle.\nSo, yes, install the Kindle app. This would be a good app for your home screen. Try to replace mindless social media usage with deep learning via either reading or podcasts.\nBut you\u2019re probably not done.\nDo you like to read before bed? Do not bring your phone to bed. That kills your sleep, bad sleep kills your health, and eventually your bad health is going to kill you. For the \u201cHuman Longevity\u201d promise of this article, buy a Kindle Paperwhite and put that next to your bed. If you\u2019re an iPhone owner, you can afford this second device.\nDo you want a book recommendation to go with this section? I\u2019ve got one you\u2019re not going to hear anywhere else. Go buy the sci-fi book Dune and read it in the context of personal development.\nAlso, two behavior design notes:\nI\u2019m absolutely positioning the Kindle to be a replacement habit for Facebook and Twitter. How much smarter would you be if you replaced half of your social media usage with reading?\nSecond, I have a not-very-well supported theory that\u2019s paired with the book Thinking, Fast and Slow. The behavior design implication of that book is that you need to speak to two systems of the brain. Speaking to the rational, Slow System is easy. Just lay out the facts.\nSpeaking to the emotional Fast System is much harder, namely because it\u2019s so hard to see or introspect on what\u2019s going on in there. But if you accept that difficulty (and this is the part of my theory that feels like pop brain science), then you realize that you need to start looking for ways to rewire your emotional core.\nThen, having accepted that rewiring your emotions is part of most behavior design, I\u2019ve started to notice things \u2014 like that most self-improvement advice is not very rational. That\u2019s by design. A self-improvement book is mostly emotional rewiring. That is exactly why you need to read the entire book rather than cheating with a summarized version.\nI\u2019ve tried and like Firefox Focus and Google Chrome, but there\u2019s a problem. Either you\u2019ll end up cutting and pasting URLs that auto-opened in Safari or you\u2019ll end up having to manage individual app\u2019s preferences about how to handle a URL click.\nSkip those complications. Safari is good.\nThere\u2019s a secret, super rad option in Safari called Reader mode. This mode strips out all of the in-article ads, clutter and junk. I find that it does a great job and saves me from fat-fingering ads that have been placed inside the body of the article.\nHere\u2019s the before and after on an article in Reader mode.\nTo turn on reader mode once, there\u2019s a little four line icon at the top left of Safari. I\u2019d managed to find that on my own.\nWhat I hadn\u2019t realized was that if you long press on that icon, you\u2019ll get an option to turn on Reader mode permanently for that site. This is amazing and completely changed my experience of reading articles on my phone.\nThere are two things that you\u2019re setting up here.\nOne is that you\u2019ll flat out save time by not seeing or accidentally tapping any ads. That\u2019s a small productivity gain each day.\nThe second is related to being in charge of your phone. You don\u2019t want to see ads because you don\u2019t want your phone telling you what to buy and when. Advertising on your phone breaks the tool-not-boss rule.\nYou\u2019ve hidden all of your shallow social media experiences in a folder on your second screen. Now, build a replacement habit for those dead times in your day when you would be tempted to be on Twitter or Facebook.\nPick the media that actually makes you smarter and then put apps for that on your home screen.\nMy apps are Medium, Kindle and Podcast. Maybe you include the Washington Post (although that\u2019s probably an anxiety producer that doesn\u2019t actually need to be checked all day).\nThese are your deep learning apps and you just need to make sure they are easier to find than your old, shallow, addictive apps.\nReplacement habits are a very common strategy in behavior design. The underlying brain science is that it\u2019s easier to create a new habit than to delete an old habit.\nIn fact, you don\u2019t ever really delete old habits. You might stop using the neural pathway for your old habit, but the neurons are still there, waiting for a moment of weakness. Eventually those cells will die out. But there isn\u2019t actually a way for you to train them to death.\nThat\u2019s why we use replacement habits so often. You can train a new, strong habit that supersedes your old habit. In this article, we\u2019ve come at social media usage in a bunch of ways, all of which work together. We\u2019ve tried to short circuit your existing habits by moving the apps, we\u2019ve added accountability through Screen Time, and in this section, we\u2019ve finally introduced the replacement habit that you\u2019ll do instead.\nSkip this step if you already have a way you track steps. Lots of you have Fitbits or other ways to do this.\nIf you aren\u2019t already using a pedometer, your iPhone will automatically track steps for you in the Health App. However, you don\u2019t want to have to open that app in order to see your step count.\nSo, you\u2019re going to need to install an app that comes with a Today screen widget. My recommendation is Pedometer++.\nYou\u2019re building up reasons now to check your Today screen daily. That\u2019s good.\nAlso, I went looking for some research to include here on the benefits of 10,000 steps. Unsurprisingly, the pleasing roundness of that number owes more to marketing than to any particular science (9,901 steps is practically just as good).\nThere is quality research on the health benefits of even tiny amounts of walking (much less than 10,000 steps): trading two minutes of sitting per hour for two minutes of walking per hour reduced mortality by 33%.\nThat\u2019s not a justification for doing a full more-is-better 10,000 steps though. The science for doing more walking is mixed, and requires piecing together your own projections. For instance, this 2004 Arizona State paper classifies people who walk 10,000 steps as active and people who walk 12,500 as highly active. But they leave it up to you to cross reference other studies on the health benefits of being in either activity category.\nSo, my recommendation is to wait on the science and trust your gut instead. For most people, walking feels good. It\u2019s a chance to use your body, to build up pride in a consistent amount of activity, to listen to podcasts, to see your town or city. Those should be reason enough.\nYou\u2019ve heard losing weight is calories in, calories out (CICO). And then you might have also heard this is wrong or at least misguided.\nThe official position in the Better Humans publication is that CICO is just the wrong framing. Rather, instead, you need to think: to lose weight, I need to burn fat.\nOur position is that weight loss is all about putting your body into fat-burning situations.\nCalorie restriction, it turns out, is not guaranteed to lead to a fat-burning situation. It can instead lead to a lower metabolism.\nWhat does lead to fat loss then? Low carb diets and fasting. And the most common form of fasting is time-restricted eating, where you fit all your eating into an 8 hour window and then fast for the next 16 hours. People refer to this as 16:8.\nAdditionally, my experience watching people diet (I ran a 15,000 person diet study and have had more than 100,000 dieters come through Coach.me), is that time restricted eating is an easier behavior change. Basically, it\u2019s easier to train your body to skip breakfast than it is to give up carbs, not for a month, but for the rest of your actual life.\nOf course, you can combine both approaches. But if you had to pick one, I\u2019d start with time restricted eating.\nIf you absolutely want to go Low Carb, download MyFitnessPal and upgrade ($49.99/year) so that you can track macros. You want to keep your carbs below about 50g. If you don\u2019t pay for the upgrade, you\u2019ll only be able to see calories and I\u2019m telling you that\u2019s not effective.\nBut really, where I want you to start is just to skip all of that food restriction stuff and start with time restricted eating. As an example, I try to stop eating before 8pm and then don\u2019t start again until noon the next day.\nTo track all of this, use an app called Zero and put it on your home screen.\nThe best explanation why fasting leads to burning fat and why simple calorie restriction leads to lower metabolism comes from Dr. Jason Fung.\nConsider that your body has two primary sources for fuel. One is glycogen, i.e. the carbs you eat. And the other is stored fat. Your body uses insulin to switch from one source to the other.\nSpecifically, when you are in a fed state, i.e. you ate recently, your body releases insulin, which inhibits your body from burning fat. Dr. Fung\u2019s uses a train track visualization below and I always try to keep in mind which track I\u2019m intending to be on.\nNight shift \u201cshifts\u201d the colors of your display away from the blue spectrum and toward the warmer (redder) spectrum. That\u2019s supposed to help you sleep better.\nThe standard advice seems to be to avoid screen time and blue light starting two hours before your bed time.\nHowever, my experience with sleep coaching is that people are often going to bed much later than they should, often because of a phone addiction. Starting Night Shift four hours earlier gives you an opportunity to both go to sleep more easily and also to shift your bed time up. If you find yourself going to bed earlier, then just get up earlier. Congratulations, you\u2019ve become a morning person.\nThe case against screens is strong. Here a quote from one study:\nAll bad.\nThe science for the red shift as a solution to all of the above negative effects is much more iffy. In fact, Night Shift is a pretty silly feature. The studies say blue light is bad. But at the time the Night Shift feature was built, nobody had done proper testing of red light. It turns out red light is also bad.\nSo, the reason I like this feature is because it\u2019s a prompt to start working on your evening routine to head to bed. Basically, it\u2019s just a color coded reminder. That\u2019s it.\nThe Medical ID feature makes key medical information available to strangers when your phone is locked.\nIf you are incapacitated during a medical emergency, a stranger can go to your power-off screen (long press right button and volume up on modern iPhones). That\u2019s where your Medical ID info will be.\nI see Medical ID as having three practical benefits to you, in order of likelihood.\nProduct designers consistently choose female voices for services like Siri and Alexa because culturally we\u2019re more comfortable with bossing around women.\nPut aside that that\u2019s gross for one second.\nYou\u2019re a productivity nut. You\u2019re going places. Don\u2019t you think at some point you\u2019re going to have to get comfortable bossing around men?\nThis is going to get weird and darkly introspective.\nOriginally, I\u2019d looked into changing Siri\u2019s voice because somebody had told me that men are more likely to be cruel to a female-voiced AI. You know what I mean about getting frustrated when Siri or Alexa makes a mistake. Alexa, especially, likes to butt in and is just begging to be told to shut up. I\u2019m constantly having to tell Alexa, \u201cAlexa, stop.\u201d but how close am I to cracking and yelling \u201cShut up, bitch?\u201d\nI don\u2019t treat any woman in my life that way and I don\u2019t want to start with a robot.\nI couldn\u2019t find any research at all to back up this idea of gendered cruelty to robots, although I did find published anecdotes:\nNot finding more established research, I backtracked to to the person who\u2019d originally told me this. Her sources were multiple backchannel discussions from people who work on these AI products. People, not just men, say the rudest, cruelest things to female AIs, much ruder and cruder than they do to male AIs. If I can get one of these AI product people on the record, I\u2019ll add it to this post.\nOur relationships to robots is so weird and interesting and scary \u2014 there\u2019s deep cultural conditioning, new robot etiquettes, power dynamics, etc.\nAt heart, I\u2019m worried about developing patterns with my female AIs that I don\u2019t have with my female friends, peers and colleagues. And what if those AI patterns transfer over to my human interactions?\nYou might think the opposite, why can\u2019t I practice treating my female AIs with respect and grace? I don\u2019t have a good answer. I just know that this dynamic is worth examining in yourself.\nWas this too weird of a tangent? This is honestly the type of shit I think about all day.\nThe default is something like, \u201cTony Stubblebine\u2019s iPhone.\u201d That exposes your privacy when you have your hotspot turned on, and advertises to the entire world that you don\u2019t know how to customize your phone.\nThere are three strategies for choosing a new name:\nHere\u2019s how to set this yourself:\nPositive self-talk is actually surprisingly effective. I always thought it was too woo-woo, but then I tested it out with some people at work. They all said it was more effective than anything we\u2019d ever done, including journaling, meditation, sleep, priority setting, and morning routines. People have a lot of negative self-talk that they don\u2019t like, but which they haven\u2019t taken the time to train theirselves out of.\nIf you\u2019re interested in positive self-talk, I got my start with this By the Book episode, where they read and tested a book about changing your self-talk.\nOf course, training yourself to be more positive isn\u2019t as simple as changing the name of your phone, but it\u2019s a start.\nIf you turn off advertising tracking, then the ads you see won\u2019t be specifically targeted to you and what advertisers know about you. The point here is that getting less targeted ads is good. You want to spend money on your own terms.\nThis is a variant on \u201cyour phone is a tool, not your boss\u201d. When you want to spend money, you want to use your phone for research and then make a purchase based on that research. You do not want the other way around, where your phone is telling you or brainwashing you what to buy. You are the boss.\nYou\u2019re still going to get advertising in some places, but almost all of the advice I\u2019ve given here includes paying for the ad-free version of the apps you use.\nPaying for ad-free apps probably saves you money, as you\u2019re less likely to buy something you don\u2019t want.\nWhen you stop using your phone, it\u2019ll auto-lock to prevent some stranger from grabbing your phone and digging through your private info. That\u2019s basically a good feature, but most often the result is that you end up locking yourself out.\nMost people keep their cell phones on their person \u2014 so keeping your phone locked is not a huge security risk. We\u2019re only talking about five minutes \u2014 that\u2019s the maximum auto-lock setting. If you check your phone on the way into your gym, walk to your locker, put your phone in your locker, change into your workout clothes, lock your locker and walk away, your phone has probably already locked itself. (Plus, most of you actually take your phone out to the gym with you!)\nSo the strategy here is to save yourself the few seconds it takes to unlock your phone by extending the auto-lock time.\nMy take on the value of saving time here is that those few seconds of waiting for a phone to wake up is when you are at risk for getting distracted. So, worst case this setting saves you a few minutes of time (research says you check your phone 25 times per day). But best case, it saves you from 30 minutes of goofing off.\nSometimes you need to share your hotspot password with a close friend or loved one. A random three-word phrase is something you can say out loud that they won\u2019t have trouble spelling.\nThis is also a more general trick for creating quality passwords that are easy for you to say or remember. Think about your router\u2019s password for example and how you\u2019re always having to share it with guests. Sharing a three-word phrase is so much easier than a string of random letters and numbers.\nThe debate about the security of this strategy for passwords ranges from very positive to just slightly positive.\nI spent a summer driving all over the United States, totaling 9,000 miles while working from a campervan. I know a thing or two about internet access from weird spots. In almost all places, using my phone as a hotspot beat out trying to find local wifi. My phone was faster and more convenient. This setting is about making your hotspot even easier to use, especially when you are connecting new devices to it or sharing it with traveling companions. That can actually be a real productivity win.\nSwipe down from the top-right of your screen and you\u2019ll have access your Control Center which contains toggles for wifi, bluetooth, flashlight and more.\nApple wants to give you the option to turn this behavior off when you\u2019re inside of a different app. That\u2019s a mistake.\nThe main reason to have always-on access to the control center is so that you can toggle wifi on and off. Direct, manual toggling of the source of your internet is an important way to control the speed of your app experiences.\nThere have been dozens of times where I\u2019ve wondered why an app was slow and then realized the culprit was either the wifi or the cell signal. As someone who travels a lot, I often find that I get the best internet speeds when I\u2019m willing to take direct control of switching between wifi and cell service. Sometimes one of those is much stronger than the other.\nWhen you are using your phone as a tool, then fast internet is a direct link to productivity. That\u2019s the main reason to have access to the Control Center.\nThis setting used to clog up your bandwidth and kill your phone battery. But we\u2019re in a new era of fast bandwidth and better batteries. So turn it on.\nThe upside is that you\u2019ll have one less thing to manage, and all of your apps will stay updated automatically.\nNo special discussion here other than referencing saving your cognitive budget. When automation works well, you\u2019re saving your brain cycles to do something better. That\u2019s the case here.\nGarageBand was 1.8GB when I went to check my installed apps. On a new phone, I\u2019m not planning to do a lot of managing my storage, but 1.8GB is enough to get my attention.\nDon\u2019t worry, you can always reinstall these apps.\nThis is the sort of thing that\u2019s better to do now, while your focused attention is on setting up your iPhone. You\u2019re saving yourself time down the road when you run out of storage at an inopportune time.\nSome people take right away to talking to Siri, and other people don\u2019t.\nThe problem is the mental version of muscle memory. If you\u2019ve never talked to Siri, then it\u2019s hard to muster the new behavior in those occasional times where it would be useful.\nHere\u2019s what I suggest: go through the script below a few times and see if anything sticks. You can turn on Siri by long pressing the button on the right of your iPhone. In parentheses, I\u2019ve listed the phrase that will reverse the alarm or reminder that you just set.\nNow do something to make calling people easier. Set a nickname for a loved one, like your mom.\nWhat we just did here is a tactic called deliberate practice. When most people read about an iPhone trick, they will try to store the trick away in their memory, hoping that they will remember that trick down the road.\nI want you to consider a much more effective approach. If you ever think you want to use a new trick or behavior later on, try practicing it first. The practice makes later recall so much more likely.\nThis is really a life philosophy to build in practice time for all of your life and work skills. For a very deep dive, see Jason Shen\u2019s Complete Guide to Deliberate Practice. This is the same article I recommended in the Meditation step.\nThere are basically two keyboard shortcuts that everyone should have. One is for your email address and the other is for your home address.\nOnce you get used to the power of shortcuts, you\u2019ll probably start adding more.\nGo to Settings > General > Keyboard > Text Replacement\nNow when you type either of those shortcuts, you\u2019ll get an option to autocomplete to your full text replacement.\nThis is a pure and simple productivity hack. No discussion necessary.\nThere are at least (at least) five places where your phone will pull your home address.\nIf you went through the Google Maps section, then you added a home address there.\nIf you went through the Text Replacement section, then you set a shortcut for your address.\nThere are still three more places to set:\nBoom. Now you\u2019ve saved yourself some typing down the road. That\u2019s productivity.\nYes, you should have backups even though practically every app you install stores your data in the cloud. But backups do make it much easier to set up a new phone when you upgrade (or lose it).\nI strongly suggest iCloud backups \u2014 they\u2019re cheap. I\u2019m on the $10.99/year package for 20GB and creeping toward the next level which is just another $0.99/month for another 30GB.\nThere should be options there to manage your iCloud storage and which apps get backed up. You should back up most of them given how cheap storage is.\nI used to resist paying for backups, but the math on the time savings alone is great. You\u2019ll pay a few tens of dollars to save yourself hours of work when you upgrade your phone. And then you\u2019ll save yourself a huge headache if you actually do lose your phone completely.\nBelow are the principles that come up over and over again in this article. Where possible, I\u2019ve tried to cite science.\nHowever, many of these principles come through my work at Coach.me. We started as a gamified habit tracker, and through that experience, we helped a few million people form a few tens of millions of new habits. The vast majority of those people were motivated by productivity or health.\nAnd then, also through Coach.me, I ran a brain training group that worked individually with 2,000 people and, separately, started a behavior design coaching certification that\u2019s produced coaches who\u2019ve worked more than with 20,000 clients.\nSo, the principles that don\u2019t have citations are, well, just, like, my opinion, man.\nNo need to lead with science here \u2014 this starts as dead simple philosophy. What\u2019s the point of life? Abdicating your life to be a servant of your phone is a shitty approach.\nMoreover, a lot of research points out that your phone is not a very good boss. See Tristan Harris\u2019 How Technology is Hijacking Your Mind or Linda Stone\u2019s Email Apnea.\nThere are a handful of exercises in this article that have very small surface-level productivity gains. Does it really matter if you save one second every time you open your phone?\nI say yes. In my experience training people to break procrastination or enter flow states, those pauses are prime times for you to get distracted. In those cases, a two second pause can turn into a 30 minute break.\nIf any programmers are reading this, what is the honest answer to how long it takes to run your automated tests? Is it the literal time that the tests run, or the time of the break you take while the tests are running?\nFrom my piece on Superhuman Cognitive Stamina:\nMany people look at this as the Steve Jobs turtleneck story. What did he wear to work every day? A black turtleneck. So while you were spending your cognitive budget getting dressed, he was saving his up for when he got to work.\nSo, on your phone, you want to look for places to eliminate decisions ,because you\u2019ll use those decisions somewhere else.\nThis NYT piece is the right primer on the research that says willpower is limited. This other NYT piece is the right primer on Carol Dweck\u2019s work that points to the opposite conclusion, that self-belief determines if willpower is a limited resource. Science is so frustrating \u2014 two seemingly opposing views. I believe willpower is limited, but trainable.\nWhen you spend time in the productivity world, you start to realize how much time people spend playing around with productivity systems.\nPart of this is that a lot of productivity nuts are pursuing productivity as a hobby \u2014 essentially, they are role-playing a world where they are more successful. So for them, it\u2019s fun to constantly tweak systems and try new tools.\nHowever, the other reason people spend so much time changing tools and systems is that rigid tools and systems break. When they break, it\u2019s almost always easier to just start over from scratch with a new system.\nSo, where possible, try to use a messy system. Those will tend to be less fragile. In this article, the most common messy systems were backed by a strong search feature.\nA strong habit is a case where you can do something automatically and effortlessly. That\u2019s so valuable. It\u2019s very rare that a new tool has a feature that\u2019s more valuable than your old habit.\nMany productivity reviews say the opposite. They say you should definitely try the newest and latest thing.\nThey\u2019re wrong. If you have a habit based around an old tool, then you should be unapologetic about sticking with that tool.\nIf any programmers are reading this, a good tool to examine would be your text editor. I alternate between Sublime and Vim. I want to be a Sublime user, but my muscle memory around Vim shortcuts is so good that I still find I\u2019m much more productive in Vim which was publicly released in 1991 and which I\u2019ve been using since 1996.\nI\u2019m strongly influenced by Cal Newport\u2019s book, Deep Work and Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi\u2019s book, Flow.\nCal comes from the perspective of deep work often being your most productive and valuable work. Mihaly\u2019s research was actually just focused on happiness. Deep work is when people report the deepest levels of satisfaction.\nBoth of them recognize how difficult it is to do deep work or deep learning. Those moments don\u2019t come by accident, and when they do, they are easily disrupted.\nA lot of the advice in this article is meant to make it just a little bit easier for you to focus, to get into flow, and to achieve deep thinking and deep accomplishments. The main strategies are to eliminate interruptions, replace shallow behaviors with deeper ones (reading vs. tweeting), and schedule leisure activities and shallow activities so that they don\u2019t interfere with your deep work.\nBy default, your phone is set up to create anxiety. I referenced a study about how mild anxiety leads to increased mortality twice in this article.\nYou paid too much for your iPhone to let it kill you \u2014 that\u2019s an outrageous side effect. So instead, eliminate the anxiety.\nI gave a few examples of how your phone can change your diet and activity patterns in order to help you live longer. Use Coach.me, Zero & the Pedometer.\nThe bare-bones budget for the advice in this article is as follows:\nBare-bones budget: $59/year\nThe mid-level budget for the advice in this article adds:\nMid-level budget: $122.99 up front and then $189/year\nThe max-level budget for the advice in this article is\nMax-level budget: $262.99 up front and then $1,172.99/year.\n#1. Turn OFF (Almost) All Notifications.Zero badges anywhere. No notifications for messaging, email, Slack. My most notable deviation for notifications is for Coach.me.\n#2. Hide social media slot machinesI don\u2019t have the Facebook app installed although I do check the web sometimes. Facebook bullied me into having the Facebook Messenger app installed because they won\u2019t show me messages on the mobile website.\n#3. Hide messaging slot machinesI do see text messages on my home screen from a small handful of people, namely my family and my dog walker. I look at everything else during scheduled inbox time.\n#4. Disable App Review RequestsDone.\n#5. Turn on Do Not DisturbDone, but just for leisure and sleep time, i.e., 6pm to 9am.\n#6. Be strategic about your wallpaperI went with the built in black-with-rainbow.\n#7. Turn off Raise to WakeDone.\n#8. Add the Screen Time widgetDone.\n#9. Add Content RestrictionsJust sfgate.com for me, which was a website that made more sense to visit when I lived somewhere else.\n#10. (Optional) Use Restrictions to turn off SafariI did this once in the past. I would do this again temporarily to break any new web browsing habits.\n#11. Organize your Apps and Folders alphabetically\nThis is how I did it. You probably won\u2019t have a TV folder like I do \u2014 most of those apps are just ways to watch Warriors basketball games.\n#12. Choose GmailYes. I get to Inbox Zero every day, practice \u201cTouch it Once\u201d where I never read an email more than once, and unsubscribe/mute/filter so that I have as little email in my inbox as possible. I don\u2019t use any built-in smart filters.\n#13. Choose Google CalendarYes.\n#14. Replace Apple Maps with Google MapsYes. I only have a Home set, since I work from home.\n#15. Install the Gboard keyboard for faster typingYes, with black background and Apple keyboard removed.\n#16. Switch to Google PhotosDone.\n#17. Use Evernote for all note taking, to-do lists, everythingYes. It\u2019s in my toolbar.\n#18. The Case for Calm as your go-to meditation appDone. It\u2019s on my home screen.\n#19. Install the right goal tracker for youYes, Coach.me, and more than 11,000 check-ins to my habits. I personally track:\n#20. Store all your passwords in a password manager, probably LastPassI use 1Password, but if I were starting from scratch I\u2019d use LastPass.\n#21. Use Numerical as your default calculatorYes.\n#22. Put the Camera app in your toolbarYes.\n#23. Use this Doppler Radar appYes.\n#24. Use this Pomodoro appYes.\n#25. Use Brain.fm for background noise\nYes.\n#26. Subscribe to these podcastsSubscribed.\n#27. Install the Kindle app but never read it in bedYes. I charge my phone in the kitchen and use my Kindle Paperwhite in bed.\n#28. Use Safari this wayYes. The option to automatically turn on readability-mode for certain sites is one of my favorite features.\n#29. Organize your home screen for deep learning over shallow learningYes.\n#30. Track steps this wayI also get steps from a Garmin watch, but I find I\u2019m more likely to have my phone on me than I am to be wearing my watch. So my phone has the more accurate count.\n#31. Prefer Time Restricted Eating Over Calorie CountingYes. Love the Zero app and I generally try not to eat before 12. I also own a KetoMojo blood tester ($60) to measure when I\u2019m in a fat burning mode.\n#32. Schedule Night ShiftYes, mine is set for 8pm.\n#33. Set up Medical IDYes, mainly so that I can share my emergency contact. I don\u2019t actually know my blood type.\n#34. Change Siri to a manI\u2019m using the Australian Man voice.\n#35. Change your phone\u2019s nameYes, \u201cI Am Focused\u201d\n#36. Turn off advertising trackingYes.\n#37. Set auto-lock to the maximum time5 minutes.\n#38. Set your personal hotspot password to a three word phraseI\u2019m not telling you what it is.\n#39. Turn on control center everywhereYes. I also have quick access to my timer and alarm from here, although I\u2019m most likely to set those from Siri.\n#40. Turn on Background App RefreshYes.\n#41. Delete Garage BandFor me, just Garage Band.\n#42. Develop verbal memory for talking to SiriYes, for all the ones in the list plus calling and face-timing people.\n#43. Set up these text replacement shortcutsI use three: my address, my personal email address, and the URL coach.me.\n#44. Set your addressYes, in all five places.\n#45. Backup this wayYes, I use iCloud, with multiple redundancies since my photos get backed up to other places and all of my important individual services are backed by cloud storage.\nDo you have anything to add or correct in this article?

All he\u2019d want to do was go out to lunch, have a few beers, and criticize our boss, company, and coworkers.\nFor a while, I just played along. But I realized how empty and cold and sad I felt all the time. My coworkers or boss didn\u2019t really like him because of his attitude, and I made the hard choice: stop hanging out with him as much.\nAfter that, my work life got a lot better. I made friends with other coworkers (and realized they were actually pretty great!). My productivity and energy improved (wasn\u2019t drinking as much over lunch on a Tuesday). My positivity soared.\nNegative friends will keep you from leveling-up. It\u2019s a hard choice, but one many people have had to make.\nAsk yourself: what\u2019s more important, the approval of a negative person, or a chance at real success and happiness?\nIt was the early 1970\u2019s. Arnold Schwarzenegger was living in Los Angeles. He had dominated the bodybuilding world, but he had a new focus: acting.\nBecoming an actor was tough \u2014 no one wanted to hire a guy with his accent. The wrong money kept knocking on his door. In his autobiography, he wrote:\nGolden handcuffs are still handcuffs.\nBeing successful means saying no to the wrong money. The wrong money will trap you, hold you down, and keep you from greatness. You need to cut it out (and keep it out) if you want to make fast progress.\nWhen I was living in South Korea, I had one focus: become a writer. That was the only goal.\nI had a ton of high-paying, interesting opportunities offered to me: a church musician, a career coach, a private tutor, a remote data entry job.\nI said no to all of them, because they couldn\u2019t take me where I needed to go.\nAfter a year of saying no to the wrong money, I had built a full-time writing business from nothing. I came back to America as my own boss, and I haven\u2019t looked back. I\u2019ve since written a book, enrolled hundreds of students in my online courses, and have coached dozens of clients.\nSay no to the wrong money. It\u2019ll slow you down and keep you away from where you really need to be.\nI\u2019ve been going to therapy, counseling, and even a 12-step addiction program for the past 7 years.\nOne of the most important lessons I\u2019ve learned is this:\nThings don\u2019t change; you change.\nRight now, you probably have a lot of old, outdated beliefs that are holding you back.\nMaybe you think you\u2019re just not good enough to sit at the table.\nMaybe you\u2019re terrified of failure and that people will laugh at you.\nMaybe you just don\u2019t believe someone like you could ever succeed.\nWe all have this emotional crap. Most people carry it around with them for years and years; extraordinary people cut it out and replace their old beliefs with new ones.\nI used to think I wasn\u2019t a good writer. That I\u2019d never be anything more than a dinky little blogger who wrote listicles about career and success or whatever.\nSo that\u2019s who I was, for 4.5 years.\nFinally, I was so sick and tired of the constant failure, I decided to change my beliefs. I began to believe I was one of the best writers on the Internet.\nAnd guess what? I began treating myself like a professional, and I got huge results. A million people have read something by me in the past 6 months or so. I get emails every week from readers telling me how much my writing has helped them.\nReminds me of an old joke:\nA guy goes to the doctor. \u201cDoctor, it always hurts when I do this!\u201d the guy complains, raising his arm at an awkward angle.\n\u201cHm,\u201d the doctor says. \u201cOK. Here\u2019s what you gotta do: stop doing that.\u201d\nGet it?\nIf your old behaviors and beliefs are hurting you, then stop it. Change and do something better.\nI\u2019ve been reading a lot of autobiographies of some of the world\u2019s most successful people.\nThey all had to learn a variety of new skills to become successful.\nA Super Bowl-winning quarterback needs to know how to do more than simply throw a ball. They need to master:\n...and a ton of other non-football-related things.\nYou don\u2019t learn all these skills if you keep watching TV instead of learning, creating, experimenting, and growing.\nLook, TV isn\u2019t bad. I watch is pretty frequently.\nBut during the seasons of my life where I needed to grow \u2014 building my writing business, learning how to manage tools like webinars, email software, coaching funnels, payment gateways, lead pages, etc. \u2014 I wasn\u2019t watching TV.\nI spending all my time learning.\nThat\u2019s how you experience hyper-fast progress.\nThe majority of people waste immense amounts of energy trying to do everything at once.\nCountless studies have proven multitasking doesn\u2019t work. Attention drag \u2014 energy that is wasted between constant shifts of focus \u2014 adds up and drains your focus. Most people try to get it all done at once but only end up burning out.\nWorse still, most people don\u2019t know how to properly rest well, either. Studies show most people sabotage their rest throughout their day with excessive consumption of coffee, alcohol, and foods, substances that severely disrupt their sleeping.\nEven during down time, people don\u2019t know how to reenergize effectively.Instead of true rest \u2014 detaching from technology, exercising, reading, or just turning your mind off \u2014 most people dive deeper into technology and distractions that only serve to drain more energy.\nThe world\u2019s most successful and effective people operate with a very different set of rules for getting rest than 99% of other people. These individuals have specific behaviors that prevent energy waste and enable massive energy production.\nWorld-class performers make rest a priority. They\u2019re really good at it. They have strict guidelines and boundaries they follow to ensure they operate with the maximum energy, as long as possible.\nThe reason most people won\u2019t escape mediocrity isn\u2019t because their not talented or smart enough.\nNo, the reason why most people will stay stuck where they are is because they haven\u2019t cut the weight that\u2019s holding them back.\nThe good news is, anyone can cut this negative weight. When you commit to avoiding negative people, saying no to the wrong money, getting new beliefs about yourself, watching less TV, and focusing on one thing at a time...\nYou can achieve extraordinary results.\nIf you want to become extraordinary and become 10x more effective than you were before, check out my checklist.\nClick here to get the checklist now!\n", "link": "https://theascent.pub/5-things-you-need-to-cut-out-of-your-life-that-are-preventing-you-from-fast-progress-396a0800d7ad", "author": "Anthony Moore", "comments": ["Thank you for the reminders, Anthony Moore!", "You\u2019re very welcome, Joy!"], "claps": "3.8K claps"}, {"num_comments": 1, "title": "Books that every engineering manager should read \u2013 freeCodeCamp.org", "tags": ["personal development", "reading", "software development", "management", "engineering"], "reading_time": 8, "text": "It\u2019s a rare occasion that companies provide leadership training before you become a manager. A few days or weeks after what was probably one of the happiest days in your recent memory, the day you were offered a position outside of the individual contributor track, you find yourself with a million questions. You feel that you were tricked into signing something without reading the fine print.\nThat feeling you\u2019re experiencing isn\u2019t new, it\u2019s just that you\u2019ve all but forgotten it. It\u2019s not knowing what you\u2019re supposed to do. It\u2019s being clueless. Because if you think years of writing software trained you to become a manager, research states the contrary. But it\u2019s not the end of the world. Even though your company most likely doesn\u2019t understand the need for formal management training, there is a plethora of information available to you that will make your job easier, and maybe even enjoyable.\nWhen I became a manager I did what I typically do when faced with a challenge I know almost nothing about: I started reading. I\u2019ve read a lot of books, some were good, a few of them were amazing. All of them shaped the way I do my job, and so I thought I would share them for other aspiring or active managers out there.\nI\u2019ve curated this list based on several factors:\nBut enough introduction, let\u2019s see the list :)\nThis should be mandatory reading for everyone. Period. No, not just everyone in software, everyone working in a private company should read this book. It\u2019s amazing to me how pretty much all of the problems that people deal with it on a daily basis have already been solved. In the 1980s. If you read just one book from this list, let it be this one.\nSoon after you make the switch from the individual contributor track to the leadership track you will ask yourself a basic question.\nYou used to be able to answer that easily. Now that you\u2019re writing code less and less, and dealing with team dynamics and people problems, how will you or your boss measure your progress and success? This book provides a now universally accepted answer: you are measured through the success of the people reporting to you. That is to say, if your team is successful, then you\u2019re successful. I\u2019m over-simplifying of course but that was my biggest take away from this book.\nThere are more insightful bits of information such as a walk-through of a production pipeline, how to run meetings, or how to conduct one on ones. This is a classic book that everyone should read even if they\u2019re not interested in leadership roles. It\u2019s that good.\nI will say though that this book was written a long time ago. The impression I got was that leaders from that age were more authoritative than what you see in companies these days. This is not a critique, it\u2019s a fair warning. You may read a few chapters and conclude that there\u2019s no way anyone could get away with doing that in a company. There\u2019s a certain nuance to the leadership style described in this book and it is important to understand it.\nAn engineering manager\u2019s job is to ensure their team has everything it needs to succeed. This means managing the interaction between multiple groups of people towards an agreeable outcome.\nIf you\u2019ve ever tried to convince a friend to move from WhatsApp to Telegram and failed, you\u2019ve made an attempt at exerting influence. You\u2019ll need to do that basically every day, and in my experience, this is a very hard skill to learn. It takes a lot of practice, and there\u2019s really no sandbox mode in which you can fail and it\u2019ll be OK. You will try to talk to someone at some point into doing something, and you will fail, and you or your team will suffer for it.\nThis book is the definitive guide on how to approach the problem scientifically. A lot of managers seem to think they don\u2019t need to learn how to influence others, particularly their direct reports, as rank is the ultimate influencer. Thinking that will keep you from ever becoming a great leader, in my opinion. Yes, you will probably overrule someone at some point and it will feel terrific while you do it. But if that person ends up hating you for it, you\u2019ve just lost their trust and you will see the consequences of that later on.\nThis is another classic textbook that I wish everyone in software would read. If you\u2019re currently in a company who\u2019s agile and are struggling with unproductive meetings, poor quality code, team members that can\u2019t get along with each other, or stakeholders who push you to leave the office late at night, you will find at least one solution within this book. It\u2019s also a good leadership book as it describes, in what is probably my favorite chapter, a list of things you definitely should not do if you want to have a great team. I still refer to that chapter from time to time, it\u2019s just really good and insightful.\nI loved this book for its humor and insights into some of the biggest tech companies\u2019 cultures. It doesn\u2019t feel like a textbook compared to the others on this list, but that\u2019s what makes it a great fit.\nYou need to understand that leaders are still human, they\u2019re going to screw up, and the end result may be tragic or hilarious. Or both. That\u2019s a very important lesson to learn, one that took me the longest time, to be honest.\nIt\u2019s very easy to get caught up in theory while trying to learn how to be a leader. But reality often is so insane that no book can offer you the solution you need. You will end up in situations where you will do everything by the book, and people will still be unhappy. And that\u2019s OK. The stories from Managing Humans will help you understand that.\nWhat makes this book awesome is that it offers a clear and simple description of your responsibilities and goals at every step in the leadership ladder. Most companies don\u2019t even have that information for their own leadership track.\nIt starts by describing what an entry-level leader should focus on, such as mentoring junior developers. It moves on to engineering managers, senior managers, and even covers what a VP of software should do. I personally have always wondered what a day in a VP\u2019s shoes looks like, and if you have as well, this book is for you.\nBeyond just taming your curiosity of what the upper echelons look like, I love this book because it is so realistic. There\u2019s no utopian view of teams and processes here. It\u2019s all ground in the experience of the author. That makes the information within highly applicable in your work environment.\nI initially didn\u2019t want to read this after I found it, but I\u2019m glad I changed my mind about it. It\u2019s basically a short story about a manager who is very good at his job, particularly in one area.\nI won\u2019t spoil it for you. The information you get out of this story isn\u2019t particularly innovative. There are other books that dive into its topic in more detail. But there\u2019s something really satisfying about it that I can\u2019t really explain. It\u2019s like a GitHub gist that solves a problem in under 100 lines of code.\nYou can be dismissive of it \u2014 there\u2019s no way it could be that simple, right? Or you can read through it carefully and appreciate its simplicity, knowing that it\u2019s not a generalized solution, but still good enough that it\u2019s worth having in your toolbox. It is entirely possible you\u2019ll read this book and think I\u2019m exaggerating, but hey, it\u2019s my list ;)\nI can count to 7 just fine, but I really wanted to offer this book as sort of a special addition to my list. I wouldn\u2019t say it\u2019s mandatory reading. Once you\u2019ve gone through all the books above, you should pick this up for a very striking alternative view.\nBasically, Radical Candor is a framework on how to relate to people. It\u2019s not really related to software development. You can apply this anywhere, with your friends, with your family, it\u2019s frankly very abstract in that regard.\nThe author, Kim Scott, has worked both at Google and Apple. She recalls some of her experiences while working there. I found those chapters to be extremely enjoyable, but do take them with a grain of salt. Some of the more recent reports in the media directly contradict some stories from this book. This is why I\u2019m hesitant to recommend it to everyone.\nThe framework itself makes sense but it\u2019s so hard to actually put in practice. I know that\u2019s not the author\u2019s fault. I wish the world would work in the way she describes, but I don\u2019t think it ever will. Nonetheless striving to achieve even 50% of Radical Candor will make you a better leader. If you have the stomach for 100% then I\u2019d like to meet you in person.\nThis list is a solid foundation for newbie managers or people who are thinking of becoming team leads or managers. There is so much more to learn. I would\u2019ve appreciated a simple and short list like this myself when I made the step towards leadership.

And grapes. Okay, so I'm not back on keto today after all.\nWhat happened?\nHonestly, I have zero resolve about food anytime I'm coping with pain.\nFor the past week, I've been dealing with extremely heavy bleeding and a period that doesn't seem to want to stop. It leaves me tired, cranky, and feeling like coping is all I can do to get by.\nEverybody knows what short-term coping feels like. Not fun, but not too terrible either. As time drags on, however, the act of coping itself feels like an enormous feat.\nI can't help but wonder why we don't talk more about the realities of coping. I hear people talk about coping with addiction, or coping with illness. But what about coping with... coping?\nWe often talk about coping as a treatment strategy when it more often acts as a symptom of disease. Or a consequence of pain.\nWe cope when thriving feels too far out of reach.\nWe turn to food, substances, or unhealthy habits as a means to survive.\nCoping isn't inherently terrible, but it's less than what we need.\nIt's simply getting by.\nIt's no secret that making healthy choices is particularly hard during times of pain. We naturally seek comfort and reprieve anytime we try to simply cope with our problems.\nI have a notoriously hard time sticking to an eating plan when I get a migraine or heavy period. So I am having a pretty damn hard time caring enough to get back on my eating plan. I just want to wait until the bleeding is over.\nAnd you know what? That's what I'm going to do.\nIt's a coping mechanism--simply getting through.\nWhen we talk about obesity, I wonder why we don't also talk about the pain and the coping that so often contributes to weight gain. Or inhibits weight loss. Or why we don't better acknowledge when coping is all we can do.\nToday, I am too exhausted to do much of anything. Too exhausted to write well. Too exhausted to be productive. Too tired to do much more than keep me and my daughter alive.\nI'm even too tired to think about fat grams or protein or tracking my food.\nSome people might say that's a copout, but I also don't think I'm the only one battling the realities of simply coping.\nSometimes, the world just takes a toll. And it's far too much.\nYou\u2019re allowed to feel all of it.\nThis morning, my daughter woke me up too early. I felt grumpy and irritated but most of all, I felt weary. That's when I knew the heavy bleeding hadn't stopped.\nLike most days, I woke up today with the desire to get a good deal of writing done first thing. But unlike most days, I felt mentally fatigued and uninspired.\nNot only that.\nI was frustrated with the way everything felt like it took too much from me when I hadn\u2019t even gotten out of the bed.\nOh, who am I kidding?\nI\u2019m still in bed.\nListening to the heavy rain.\nListening to Daniel Tiger\u2019s Neighborhood playing on my daughter\u2019s tablet.\nListening to my daughter sniffle and refuse to use a freaking tissue.\nI\u2019m pretty sure my blood pressure keeps rising over the most ridiculous things.\nI want to write.\nScratch that.\nI want to write something good.\nSomething that resonates deeply with other people. Something that means a lot to me, and something I\u2019m proud to call my own.\nBut guess what?\nRight now, I\u2019m not feeling it.\nI am uninspired.\nAnd I hate to write when I\u2019m feeling uninspired.\nI hate to write when I\u2019m feeling too tired. Or too something.\nToo emotional.\nEverybody\u2019s got their thing that makes life hard. You know, that thing or 2 or 5.\nMost days, my thing is the single mom thing. The how-the-hell-am-I-gonna-get-all-this-shit-done thing.\nClearly, I get some shit done because I\u2019m still here. Still writing.\nBut it\u2019s not always good.\nAnd today, I can't help but look at my life and admit it's a \"not good\" kind of day. It's a cope with my pain kind of day, and one thing that helps is simply knowing I'm not really alone in any of this.\nJoin my email list to keep in touch.\n", "link": "https://medium.com/60-months-to-ironman/when-we-must-cope-with-our-pain-d50bb9c52aba", "author": "Shannon Ashley", "comments": ["No you\u2019re not, and you\u2019ll probably never be.Not because there are millions going through something similar, but because after reading this, I know I\u2019ve been through something similar.I know I\u2019ve coped when I shouldn\u2019t have.", "It is ridiculous that we don\u00e7t have medical marijuana available for pain depression, PTSD, etc. The progress and education is slow.", "Friend Shannon- Rome, Berlin were won.

And a thousand places far, far removed from a shitty little Las Vegas rental stuffed to overflowing with nearly-parentless children.\nBooks also taught me how to love those kids. And our parents. How to survive and how to forgive.\nBooks taught me that sometimes life seems nearly impossible \u2014 but that most of the time, the hero of the story survives.\nThey convinced me that getting through was not only the way out, but that it was worth it.

Let her tell you about her adventures from the world in which she lives. Let her wow you with her animated recollections as you sit there in awe, struck by the amazement of her long memory. You must know that some of it is the act of embellishment. Some of it is simply for show, but on this stage, she is Juliet, so let her shine.  One of my baby cousins, Jaidynn has been a bubble of excitement from day one. She is fully equipped with sass, intelligence, and inquisitiveness. She also has the most infectious laugh on the planet. While reading Curious George Makes Pancakes to her, I took brief moments to watch her reaction to the things that the eager, little monkey had gotten himself into. I also paid attention to her commentary, \u201cOoh, why\u2019s he using blueberries? I don\u2019t like blueberries.\u201d This, a flaunting of her opinion about Curious George choosing to use blueberries instead of bananas or strawberries as the fruit for the pancakes \u2014 strikes you as the beginnings of a detail-oriented being.  I read the book with the peace that consumes me when I am writing or listening to music. I read it knowing that someone more concerned with the actions of a fictional character wanted to get to the ending, but also, wanted to savor it a bit too. Let a three-year-old have choo-choo train rides on your thigh. Let her raise her arm up and down and make the whistle blow. Give her piggyback rides, tickle her belly, and plant zerberts (raspberries) on her chubby cheeks.  And when you\u2019re done with that...\nLet your youngest cousin join in on the fun. Caison is learning how to assert himself in a small crowd. He is reminding us to be mindful that he is still in the room if we have forgotten for half of a second. He is beginning to talk, using little words such as, \u201cHey,\u201d \u201cBye-Bye\u201d, \u201cNo,\u201d and \u201cYay.\u201d He also likes to clap and listen to music and if he can do these two in unison, he is content. Not yet two, Caison lets me know when I have to shift gears and give him moments of my time. He may jump in when Jaidynn and I are singing or talking about nothing at all (which is very interesting, by the way).  And when this happens, you watch a one-year-old lure you into his realm by simply using his smile or his raspy voice to alert you. You let him caterpillar crawl up your leg, to get to your lap so that he can show you that he knows how to initiate a game of peek-a-boo. He also wants to show you that he can make sounds with his lips by tapping his fingers over them, sort of like a baby beat-boxing routine. He is showing you what you have shown him and you must watch. He has learned these things by observation and whether or not you recognize the beauty in this, you cannot deny the awesomeness.  In the heart of a child, there is nonstop fun, the ability to create without being prompted, love, honesty, and impatience. If you are a \u201cbig kid,\u201d you remember how to let the little things inspire you. Let them remind you that life can be light, it can be love. Let them tap you on your shoulders and whisper in your ear, \u201cI gotta pee\u201d and watch them remove themselves from your presence quickly in order to satisfy that need.

Such cases are living on Indian Streets rigged with poverty and helplessness. In a country like India the male to female ratio of mental health disorder is quite low from rich countries where it is 3:1 (In India it is 1.5:1).\nAccording to a study conducted by the National Institute of Mental Health and Neurosciences, 1 in 40 and 1 in 20 people are suffering from the past and current episodes of depression in India.

There are just about 40 mental institutions (out of which only nine are equipped to provide treatment for children) and fewer than 26,000 beds available for a nation comprising 1.50 billion people. The WHO report on the Mental Health Atlas More Details reveals that there are just three psychiatrists, and even lesser number of psychologists for every million people in India, which is 18 times fewer than the commonwealth norm of 5.6 psychiatrists per 100,000 people.\nThere are two main factors which women in India have to face. The first one is stigmatisation of the mental health disorder. In India, it is of utmost importance that women do not bring shame to the family. If they are associated with any mental health disorder then they are shunned. They are called disgrace of the family as they are not able to perform their expected roles.\nOnce a woman acts \u2018abnormally\u2019, she is very likely to be stigmatised. But how does an affected woman act then? In this regard, Renu Addlakha argues, that \u201cone outcome of this gender-based differential access to mental health services is the higher rates of female utilisation of magico-religious systems, such as temple healing, native healers, exorcists and faith healers\u201d.\nThe second factor is exclusion. There are women like Shakti living on streets and some who spend their whole lives there.\nThis grave ground reality of Indian women experiencing a mental health disorder is quite alarming. The number of suicides are increasing and it is of a major concern that if India will be able to meet the UN Sustainable goals objective to reduce suicides by 10%. There is no active suicide prevention policy by government of India.\nThough a proper legislation is present. A bill was passed in 2017, came into effect on 2018 which replaced old law . In the old law- Mental Health Act (1987) the review processes or appeal processes for mentally ill patients were far from realistic. The Mental Health Care Bill(2017) was introduced in the light of the provisions made under the United Nations Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disability (UNCRPD).The old law was not any good in doing away with stigmatisation and exclusion. The new law decriminalises suicide, allows mentally ill patients to pick their caretaker and decide the course of their treatment. A person with mental illness shall not be subjected to electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) therapy without the use of muscle relaxants and anaesthesia. Furthermore, ECT therapy will not be performed for minors.Another highlight of this Act is to protect the rights of a person with mental illness.The Government is advised to setup Central Health Authority at national and State Health Authority at State Level. The Section 2 (r) defines the term \u201cmental illness\u201d as a substantial disorder of thinking, which grossly impairs judgement, behaviour, capacity to recognise reality or ability to meet the ordinary demands of life and includes mental conditions associated with the abuse of alcohol and drugs.\nTherefore there is a lot of work which has been done on paper. However ground reality still is pitch dark. Only 1% of India\u2019s Health annual budget is given to Mental Health and issues. There is inadequate architecture thus there is a need to reallocate the Health Budget.\nAlso there is ignorance about the mental health condition. Due to this the advance directive of choosing one\u2019s one medical treatment is quite difficult and long process.The Bill also does not take into account factors such as poverty, the immediate environment of the individuals and other socio \u2014 cultural factors which affect an individual\u2019s mental health.\nAccording to research the Suicide helplines in India are quite inefficient. Most of them don\u2019t work 24/7. If you google \u201csuicide helpline in India\u201d the number of one NGO\u2019s helpline will flash . However if you call it, it never works. Such is the state of most helplines in India. There are many reports which state how worse is the state of National Helplines by NGOs . However there is no official helpline in country.\nThus there is a need to revise the spendings, concern and work accordingly to eliminate stigma, exclusion and achieve Sustainable Development Goal . We also need to focus on educating people and children especially in economically backward areas . If stigma won\u2019t go then there will be no effect of the good infrastructure and spending .\nAccording to a recent survey \u2014 \u201cRespondents were asked about their feelings towards people with mental illness. While there exists widespread sympathy towards sufferers, with more than 75% of participants stating they would always feel sympathetic towards them, they also exhibit feelings of fear (14% would always be fearful), hatred (28% feel hatred sometimes or always), and anger (43% feel angry sometimes or always) towards people with mental illness. More than a quarter admitted that they would always be \u2018indifferent\u2019 towards people with mental illness.\u201d\nWe need more groups like Tarasha and more policies like Gatekeeper started by NIMHANS India . According to this policy (http://www.nimhans.ac.in/nimhans-centre-well-being/gatekeeper%E2%80%99s-training-suicide-prevention) more than 500 people are trained to deal with Suicide Prevention. There must be a training programme like Gatekeeper in schools and offices to deal with this silent deadly epidemic. This is because many times families an peers of a suffering individual do not know how the patient must be treated, they lack basic empathy.\nWe have covered a long way, to achieve UN\u2019s SDG we need to cover a lot more\n", "link": "https://medium.com/varnikas-viewpoint/silent-epidemic-which-has-hit-india-27d8e3d47414", "author": "varnika goel", "comments": [], "claps": "120 claps"}, {"num_comments": "unspecified", "title": "The Weightage of Economic Development in India\u2019s 2019 General Elections", "tags": ["indian elections 2019", "economic development", "politics", "india"], "reading_time": 4, "text": "With the unraveling of India\u2019s general elections, questions arise, what makes a candidate worthy of appointment? What is the criterion for an effective government? How can a government increase its efficacy?\nThe economic environment, specifically the degree to which economic development is or can be attained, plays a dominant role in determining electoral outcomes.\nEconomic development, apart from the Gross Domestic Product, factors in the growth of employment, incomes/wages, the standard of living, economic disparity, and sectoral growth.\nMany candidates come to power because of the economic development they facilitate in their previous term(s), or because of the economic promises they make.\nFocusing on India, during the 2004 general elections, the then incumbent government, National Democratic Alliance [Atal Bihari Vajpayee], lost as their economic initiatives failed to benefit a large section of the poor. As a result, United Progressive Alliance triumphed in the elections, with Manmohan Singh as the Prime Minister.\nThe global economic boom of 2004\u201308, right before the Lehman Brothers\u2019 Bankruptcy, benefitted the UPA government\u2019s term, enabling it to be elected for a second term in the 2009 elections.\nHowever, with the tremors of the 2008 financial crisis along with the government\u2019s poor governance, inflation rose as the real GDP growth rate fell to as low as 4.5%. The value of the Indian Rupee fell from \u20b939.5 in 2007 to \u20b968.8 in 2013. To exacerbate the situation, multiple corruption cases, such as the 2G Scam, Coal Scam, and Common Wealth Games Scam, came to the spotlight.\nThese shabby economic numbers, along with the allegations of corruption, resulted in rising prices, low private investments, a weak growth rate of job creation, and joblessness.\nHence, given the economic record and the inability to convey ways to rectify economic problems, the UPA government failed to secure a third consecutive term.\nWith this, came the NDA government. Candidate Narendra Modi\u2019s slogan of \u201cAcche Din\u201d [Good Days] resonated with a significant section of the electorate. His priority of creating jobs and eradicating corruption further boosted his campaign.\nShifting focus to the 2018 Indian state elections in Madhya Pradesh and Rajasthan, the major cause to NDA government\u2019s defeat was agricultural distress.\nAgricultural distress is a result of dwindling prices of farm commodities, rising farmer debt, and weak infrastructure investment ensuing large gaps in storage and limited connectivity.\nThe defeat was enough of a worry to compel the NDA government to announce the PM-Kisan scheme, which guarantees a support income of \u20b96000/year to 120 million small and marginal farmers with a landholding of fewer than 2 hectares.\nLooking beyond India, we notice that there is a trend of economic development being the major influencer in elections.\nIn the 2016 US Presidential Election, the leading cause of Trump\u2019s election is attributed to his slogan of \u201cMake America Great Again\u201d, which, primarily promised to bring back jobs to the US.\nZimbabwe\u2019s former President, Robert Mugabe, who was once viewed as a hero, was overthrown because of his inability to bring about economic development. Inflation was soaring, the value of Zimbabwe Dollar was deteriorating, and the unemployment rate was high.\nThe current struggle of Venezuelans to dethrone their current President, Nicholas Maduro, is stimulated due to the terrible economic environment he has constructed with his mismanagement. The motive, of the people, here is a terrible economic environment. Venezuela has experienced an economic meltdown, with inflation reaching at least 800,000% in 2018. Such an economic environment has induced more than 3 million people to leave Venezuela, the remaining, organizing a coup d\u2019e\u0301tat.\nAbdullah II of Jordan, who has been ruling since 1999, is well accepted in Jordon because of the economic development that he has enabled. Since he came into power till 2008, liberal economic policies were brought forth, thus facilitating a robust GDP growth rate along with job creation and curbed inflation. The people have, consequently, accepted and supported his rule, prior to the Arab Spring Movement.\nWith the focus on economic development, a country simultaneously brings about social development. Through the rise in a country\u2019s employment, income/wages, the standard of living, and its narrowing economic disparity, people, at the same time, experience an improvement in their living conditions.\nIn fact, an economic crisis comes with a humanitarian crisis. For instance, Venezuela\u2019s economic crisis, since 2013, has escalated to a humanitarian crisis, marked with rising hunger, disease, crime, deaths, and an exodus from the country.\nThe Greek Depression, caused by the government\u2019s mismanagement of its debt, resulted in people being homeless, unable to meet daily food expenses, and being vulnerable to depression, addiction, and suicide.\nA country as economically developed, such as the US, is socially developed with its low poverty rates, high life expectancy, and literacy rates.\nNow, as the Modi government\u2019s term reaches its end, it is essential to review the government\u2019s performance on the economic front.\nApart from contained inflation and a GDP growth rate that hit 8.2% in 2016\u201317, joblessness and agricultural distress remain the two key issues that the government was unable to solve.\n", "link": "https://medium.com/@neharana16.05.98/the-weightage-of-economic-development-in-indias-2019-general-elections-5a7ca11cd9bc", "author": "Neha Rana", "comments": [], "claps": "15 claps"}, {"num_comments": "unspecified", "title": "What is it like being an Engineer at Fynd \u2013 Building Fynd", "tags": ["ecommerce", "india", "culture", "startup", "engineering"], "reading_time": 7, "text": "In February 2015, while I was looking to make a move to a full time engineering role and utilise my Python skills better, I was serendipitously introduced to a startup called Shopsense by Ankur Chandra. A few interviews later, I found myself in the company of a small team in an office at Andheri, Mumbai.\nFor someone who had never worked in a startup before, I was surely making a big bet in joining one. The team however, was taking an even larger bet on someone who didn\u2019t quite know everything required to build and scale their retail platform. Ankur, who referred me and also a few others later earned an award for being the HR of the year. He still works here, so do a majority of the engineering team who have been with us since >2 years.\nAfter recently completing 4 years at Fynd (which is a lot in startups), I started reflecting on what it is that made me stick here each of the past 1500 days. In these 1500 days, we have evolved our business model, grew the initial team to 140+ members, launched multiple new products all of which have scaled in the market. All of this happened while keeping our core culture and values intact.\nWhat aspects of our Engineering culture have led me to being here since 4 years? Read on.\nIn my first week itself, I was put at the forefront of problems by being asked to debug a Solr indexing issue for one of our enterprise customers. I absolutely had no knowledge of Solr at that time but determined to solve the issue, I kept on digging and eventually could solve it. Fast forward a few months, when AWS launched its Mumbai Region I was asked to migrate all our services to this region with minimal downtime. Fast forward a few more months, I worked on automating our Infra from scratch to support Auto Scaling Groups and thereby improve our platform\u2019s reliability.\nAcross all my experiences, I have seen everyone rising to the occasion and emerging out victorious with a big boost to their self-confidence.\nWhile executing on large problems, YOU are completely in-charge of them and have the complete freedom to operate independently. This autonomy allows you as a builder to explore multiple solutions, consult the wider team and double down on the most effective one. Taking on bigger and bigger problems allows you unparalleled growth as an IC that would otherwise not have been possible. In my early months, I was asked to design and build an Order Management System from scratch to support order fulfilment from retail stores. At that time, I closely observed how the Operations team worked to fulfil orders, and came up with a plan to automate parts of their workflow. This went through a team review and we built it over a few weeks while getting feedback from the users. There was absolutely no approval from superiors/peers required. This autonomy has led to increased agility which has become one of the hallmarks of our culture and has allowed us to move fast.\nOur vision is to build a New Retail platform that organises online, offline, logistics and data across a single value chain. To add some perspective (of what user-base we are building for) the number of online shoppers in India is 100M, whereas online shopping only forms ~15% of the overall shopping. We are building product suites to reach these 100M customers and another 600M customers as well who will be shopping online by 2025. Our 5 products across multiple audiences in the B2B and B2C domain are helping us reach them. Our current user base of 20M indicates that our growth has just started and we have a long way to go. We are committed to redefining not just e-commerce but how retail operates in general. With this vision in front of us, the opportunity to make an impact is profound.\nOur team comprises of a very hard-working bunch of individuals who raise the bar of people around them. They are well grounded, keep each other accountable and support everyone. The bar for teamwork is set by our co-founders who are also instrumental in keeping our core values intact. One of our core values says \u201cNo Politics, No bullshit\u201d and this is actually true. I haven\u2019t seen any instances of this anytime in my tenure so far.\nWe have 40+ services so far and we are in the process of adding a few more by splitting out older services as well as adding new ones for newer platform features. These services use diverse but mature technologies and we avoid using shiny objects which increase our operational overhead. Our stack comprises of these components -\nA stack such as this gives ample exposure to newer toolchains as well as the freedom to go deep into areas of interest. A large chunk of our Engineering team is comfortable with multiple languages and contributes end to end to our products.\nIn the early phases when we were building out the initial versions of the Fynd Apps and the platform we had specialist teams devoted to Backend, Frontend & Mobile since the early engineers were hired based on these skill-sets. As time passed, we realised this structure didn\u2019t allow us to move as fast as we could. These teams were then restructured into generalist teams, (we call them Domains) each of which mapped to one or more areas of our business. Farooq, our co-founder talks more about our Engineering re-org here. We have had engineers transition from Android to Platform, Android to ML, iOS to Infra, Web to Platform and so on. What\u2019s surprising about these transitions is that these engineers still thrive on both stacks and help us build better products. These are your quintessential T shaped engineers.\nWe\u2019ve borrowed a great deal of practices from established companies that have allowed us to operate well as a team. We use the OKR (Objectives & Key Results) approach to chalk out quarterly focus areas and goals for each of our teams. What\u2019s best in this approach is that, not all of these goals cascade from the top. Teams are free to set their own Key Results which can move the needle on our metrics. We have also ditched the six month review routine in favour of a continuous feedback process. 1\u20131s are held monthly for everyone which allows feedback to flow more frequently leading to continuous improvement. Teams also review their managers using an Upward feedback mechanism which happens twice a year.\nOnce a year we pack our bags and head off to a new destination as a team. Our workcations have taken us to Kuala lumpur, Phuket, Singapore, Bangkok, Gokarna and Goa so far. We use this time to reflect, learn, and bond away from the usual settings. This is in addition to the frequent team dinners, sports events and annual off-site.\nThere are a lot of other aspects of our culture that we are collectively improving. Here\u2019s a few -\nMost parts of our culture that I described above weren\u2019t designed up front. We evolved via lots of experimentation and are still evolving as we scale.\nWe are currently hiring for all Engineering roles. If you would feel at home with our culture apply here to work with us!\n", "link": "https://blog.gofynd.com/what-is-it-like-being-an-engineer-at-fynd-4a54cd3c8a46", "author": "Kushan Shah", "comments": [], "claps": "114 claps"}, {"num_comments": 6, "title": "A Word to the Wise \u2014 Stop Watching Your Stats! \u2013 The Startup \u2013 Medium", "tags": ["medium", "inspiration", "writing", "writing tips", "mental health"], "reading_time": 8, "text": "I know others have written about this before, but I\u2019ve come to several realizations that I just wanted to share on this topic. They have to do with those metrics we all love to keep an eye on as an indication of how successful our writing endeavors are on Medium. Maybe you\u2019ve had a similar experience to the one I\u2019ve had.\nI\u2019ll be reading posts and notice that the number in the notification circle at the top right has jumped up. I open the function and it says something like this:\nExcited, I\u2019ll go to my stats page only to find I have a grand total of 3 more fans than the last time I looked and that bright green bar doesn\u2019t look like it\u2019s grown at all. What!?!!? How can that be?\nI don\u2019t know if you\u2019re like me but I make a practice of monitoring my stats almost constantly while I\u2019m on Medium which currently is most of the day. Part of this is because of that little colored number circle up in the right hand corner. Sometimes I wish it wasn\u2019t there at all. This is because it encourages me to click over to the stats page whenever I see it. What I find there can be a major determinant of my mood, energy level and motivation to write as well as how involved I become in Medium related activities during the day.\nThose days when my notifications are continuously high, I find I have more energy and feel more inspired to write than on days when that number is lower. I also feel more like interacting with other writers, reading, commenting and becoming involved in the different Medium related Facebook groups that I am in.\nIt\u2019s a bit of a double edged sword however, as the higher I get the quicker I fall. When I feel like things are going particularly well, with my stories showing a lot of reads and high engagement, should a new story I write not follow that pattern, I find myself crashing. Also when notifications are low over the course of the day, my mood typically bottoms out.\nThe other problem comes as a result of notifications reflecting not just claps and other engagement but also whenever someone highlights something I\u2019ve already highlighted. So at times it may seem like my stories are getting a lot of traction but when I open my notifications I find that the majority of notifications reflect people who have highlighted the same thing I have in someone else\u2019s article.\nThe bottom line is that notifications and the number of fans listed on your stats page don\u2019t always match up. I can\u2019t tell you why that is exactly but it seems like it is often the case. Don\u2019t worry too much about it, things get corrected eventually.\nEven though notifications and fans may not always seem to match, I do know that usually it seems like the graph and associated numbers will catch up. There are days when it seems like I\u2019m getting few notifications with a similar lack of progress shown in my stats and graph, but both will jump later in the day or late night when fewer people should be on.\nI\u2019ll wake up the next morning, turn on my laptop and find that somehow although I checked my numbers after midnight, the previous days stats have increased. I\u2019ve also sometimes noticed that I\u2019ll look at my stats well after midnight and the graph hasn\u2019t rolled over to the next day yet. The point of all this is just that the system may be behind in updating things.\nIt is also important to understand that the number of fans listed on your stats page reflects the number of unique people who clap for each story. In other words, if someone visits a story three times and claps each time, while all the claps are credited, the reader is only counted as a fan the first time they clap.\nI am in several Medium Facebook groups and know that there are times that writers will list old links and people who have already clapped for them will go back and add more claps to indicate their support. When this happens although they\u2019ll be listed in your notifications every time, the subsequent claps will not count towards additional fans and so the total will not increase.\nAnother huge problem I have regarding checking my stats is that I set arbitrary criteria to indicate whether or not my success as a writer on Medium is growing. Medium\u2019s stat page is interesting in that it reflects the previous 30 days regardless of where in the month you are. So each day you lose the number of views, reads and fans from what was the first day of the 30 from the previous day and gain the views for that day.\nWhat that means is as long as your numbers for that day were higher than for the day that dropped out, your totals will go up. If however, your numbers for that day were lower than for the day that dropped out your totals will seem to decrease.\nThis graph shows my fan total for today. At the stroke of midnight when there will be no new fans for tomorrow, my fan summary stat will show whatever the total number of fans were for today minus 46 which is the number of fans shown for March 22th the number reflected in the first bar of the graph above. I will need to get 46 new fans tomorrow before this number will go up Anything less than that, and the number will go down.\nWhile I\u2019m aware that this occurs I generally don\u2019t worry about it. We all have good days and bad and with this type of system dropping doesn\u2019t mean that the success you\u2019ve realized is heading in the other direction.\nYet this characteristic can make me downright despondent whenever I jump to the next 100 fans. This is because invariably there will be days that my numbers lag and my totals drop back to the previous hundred. What I mean by this is, for example, if I go from 1500 fans to 1600 fans I get excited. I know each day number will drop as I lose all of fans from the day that dropped and until it gets to be about midday, I\u2019m not likely to reach the same number that would put me where I had been. So if I\u2019ve reached 1500 fans for example, and it drops back to 1400, I feel depressed and my imposted syndrome will kick in full force. I decide that all the previous days that had gone into me reaching the level I am at were meaningless.\nI also have a bad habit of reviewing my past performance in 30 day intervals. When the increase in numbers seems to be leveling out I also feel like a fraud. I know it\u2019s easy to double your numbers in the beginning because they will be fairly low. Going from 20 fans to 40 fans is a lot easier than going from 1000 fans to 2000 fans. But thinking about 20 to 40 in terms of doubling fans sounds impressive while the difference between between 1000 fan and 1020 fans doesn\u2019t seem very impressive despite it being the same increase.\nIt\u2019s natural to want to see that your writing efforts are paying off. The way we are able to do this on Medium on a day to day basis is to review our statistics. Notifications let us know when people are reading and engaging with our work and this can often cause us to jump to our stats page to see what our numbers look like.\nBut watch the head space you are in and the rules you establish for yourself in determining what your statistics mean in terms of your overall success. There are no objective criterion for how to define success on Medium and how exactly to know that you are continuing to grow in the ways you desire based on the statistics alone. Even positive trends that you are excited about one day may reverse a few days later which may be the result of several things that have nothing to do with you at all.\nIf you get caught up in monitoring every view, clap and read, you\u2019re liable to experience decreasing motivation, make yourself crazy or just become so frustrated you drop off Medium all together. I\u2019ve found that for me it\u2019s best to view statistics sparingly. Try looking at them perhaps once first thing in the morning and once at night, as this is when you are most likely to see the biggest increase in your reading engagement that occurs across the day. This will help imbue you with enthusiasm and motivation for your writing so you can continue on your path to success.\nNatalie Frank (Taye Carrol) has had work featured in Haunted Waters Press, Weirdbook Magazine, Siren\u2019s Call Publications, Lycan Valley Press and Zero Fiction among others.

Either Elon saw it then, or it was the first image he found when googling the meme.\nWhatever the reason, it began a cascade of bizzaro world interactions between a museum of English rural life in Reading and the 25th most powerful person in the world.\nWe changed our name to the Muskeum of Elonglish Rural Life, got sassy, disappointed people asking for free teslas, launched a range of electric sheep and got into The Times (print), BBC, MailOnline and The Telegraph.\nI didn\u2019t coordinate this with Elon Musk.\nIt was just weird and it just happened.\nThe best I could do was react.\nAnd that really is all I did. I relied (again) on the trust of my colleagues, meaning I can change our profile picture, change our name and spend a couple of days pretending to be Elon Musk without asking permission.\nUsually for this type of thing we try and have a variety of content, so that alongside the silly stuff we also have something more serious and in-depth for those who want it. When we first tweeted the absolute unit, for instance, we had a blog on livestock genetics.\nWith Musk, we didn\u2019t have this luxury. I could have pushed the interactions much more, made more imaginative links to our collections and perhaps even asked for a donation for using our sheep photograph.\nAs it was, this all kicked off on my day off, half an hour before going to sleep. I was mentally exhausted after a stressful start to the year. We were visiting my partner\u2019s parents and I only had my phone and tablet, meaning I had no access to Photoshop. Because it was Easter, there was nobody even in the Museum to help (apart from hardworking Front of House).\nBut then, maybe that didn\u2019t matter. When the sheep went viral there was a broader audience \u2013 when Elon Musk gets involved, it\u2019s a mix of memelords, anime fans, car enthusiasts and people just along for the ride. They didn\u2019t seem to particularly care about the background of the sheep, they just cared that Elon was using a meme.\nOne interesting thing was the private messages we received after changing our profile picture to Elon, with at least some people thinking we were the man himself. I had messages from people asking for jobs, for money to help their starving families, and for free teslas. Some just asked for memes. It was a terrifying glimpse of the amount of noise celebrities attract on Twitter, and I don\u2019t know how they cope.\nUltimately this was a weird one-off, a ripple from our absolute unit of last year. It cements for me the fact that our sheep is now a part of internet history, which is both cool and a little strange.\nIt also reinforces the importance of having the trust and freedom to react to events. It means being comfortable with doing social media that is just purely silly, and saving the education for next time.\nIt also shows that social media does not care if you\u2019re on holiday.\n", "link": "https://medium.com/@adamkoszary/swapping-souls-with-elon-musk-1e5ef243e1fa", "author": "Adam Koszary", "comments": [], "claps": "28 claps"}, {"num_comments": "unspecified", "title": "How I Landed a Decent Job in Digital Marketing With No Work Experience.", "tags": ["freelancing", "jobs", "entrepreneurship", "digital marketing", "remote working"], "reading_time": 5, "text": "Having gone to an Ivy League institution, I had \u201cgreat expectations\u201d that a bright career was waiting for me in \u201cthe real world\u201d as soon as I finished school. I attended all four years of college on a full scholarship, awarded to a select group of students from developing countries, with potential to inspire positive change in their communities after their studies.\nI spent the summers going back home to work on projects that were aimed at finding solutions to some of the challenges in my community, in a small village in the Eastern part of Rwanda. Each of those summers, I applied and won some grant money to work on the projects. They included working with kids teaching them how to use computers, working on an irrigation and community farm project, and even helping to start a restaurant. Although most of the projects weren\u2019t long term successes, the experiences and lessons they provided proved to be invaluable.\nBack at Dartmouth, I wasn\u2019t very focused on my studies. The first two years passed before I figured out why I was there. However, I believed in the mission of the King Scholars Program, and the idea of doing something positive in my community back in Rwanda, but I couldn\u2019t figure out what exactly I was going to do, and I certainly wasn\u2019t finding it in the courses I was taking.\nI became very interested in entrepreneurship, joined the Dartmouth Entrepreneurship Network, and even came up with ideas to compete in some of the pitch competitions. I remember participating in a pitch competition in which I was the only African student. My ideas were usually not that great, but I challenged myself to have the experience of pitching an idea in front of an audience.\nAs I read more and more about entrepreneurship, I stumbled upon the field of digital marketing. I like to think I learned about it through online research, but I was probably watching funny prank videos on YouTube, and saw the viral ad from Tai Lopez, \u201cHere in my garage!\u201d\nAs I got more curious about digital marketing, I learned that this was indeed a field that had high demand in the job market. As industries become more digitized, companies are always searching for ways to get their brand messages to the right customers, in a world where almost everyone has a mobile device and is on multiple social media platforms.\nHowever, I could not find a single course at school, about this. So, I ended up paying hundreds of dollars for online courses about digital marketing. All the courses that I took opened up new possibilities for me, and made me think that maybe, I finally got something, a skill, that would eventually allow me to do great things. In order to practice what I learned, I started a couple of Shopify stores trying to sell t-shirts through dropshipping. If you are not familiar with dropshipping, it is a method of retail fulfillment, where, as an online store owner, you don\u2019t keep the products you sell in stock. When a customer makes a purchase, the item is shipped from a third party, for example from AliExpress in China, directly to the customer\u2019s address. I never made decent money from this, but I learned a lot from the process.\nThis was so exciting, I thought to myself, \u201cI am going to start a digital marketing business right after graduation.\u201d\nAfter graduating in the summer of 2018, the hard reality that awaited me was the fact that there was so much more to starting a business than I realized. I had gathered all this knowledge and skills, but didn\u2019t have the ability to package them into a sellable product. I had absolutely no sales experience, and didn\u2019t know where to start. I spent the entire summer without any source of income. When I got my work authorization card, I applied to multiple jobs and most of the time never heard back. I couldn\u2019t use my Media Studies degree from such a great school as Dartmouth to find a job.\nMy host family allowed me to stay at their house in San Francisco, and in exchange, I helped out with a project they were working on, turning their home into a retreat center for artists, entrepreneurs and philanthropists.\nDuring that time, I learned about freelancing and decided to give it a shot. I created a profile on Upwork, the biggest freelancing platform, and submitted proposals to a few jobs with zero expectations that anyone would hire someone like me with zero work history. There was nothing to convince the potential clients that I could get the results they wanted. The only experience that I cited was the Facebook and Instagram ads that I ran for my failed Shopify stores.\nTo my surprise, and delight, I got an offer to run google ads for a client\u2019s online store. After a few days, I got a second offer to manage social media ads, and then a third. Within about three months of being on Upwork, I had five clients.\nOne of the clients that I worked with happened to be a marketing manager from Upwork itself. They ended up hiring me full time, to help in managing all their paid social media advertising accounts. I finally landed a fulltime job, because of a skill I learned online that cost me less than $1,000 to learn. The best part about the job is that I get to work completely remotely, working from home or anywhere I can find an internet connection, on my own schedule, and I can still do freelance work when I have the time.\nWhen you do a search for jobs related to digital marketing, it doesn\u2019t take long for you to realize that there is more demand than supply. Businesses of all sizes are constantly looking for talent to complement their marketing efforts. Upwork has listed digital marketing among the most in demand skills on the platform. And most of these opportunities are remote, which means that anyone in the world with the right skills can compete for them. Plus, most of the people in need of such talent do not care which school you went to, or whether you went to college at all. All they care about is whether you can be trusted to deliver the results they need.\nIt is possible that there was a little bit of luck in my situation landing a great job so fast, but my story is not exclusive. There are stories of people from various career backgrounds who have managed to land high paying jobs in Data Analytics and Digital Marketing fields, only after learning the required skills for a few weeks or months. If you are currently struggling to find a job or to find work that you enjoy, it\u2019s definitely possible to find a great job, one that could even allow you to work from anywhere. You just need the right skills, coupled with great communication skills to make sure you are networking the right way, and to make potential clients and/or employers trust you enough to give you a shot.\n", "link": "https://medium.com/@e_iradukunda/how-i-landed-a-decent-job-in-digital-marketing-with-no-work-experience-fd175f892cc8", "author": "Eric Iradukunda", "comments": [], "claps": "34 claps"}, {"num_comments": 5, "title": "8 Useful Mental Models \u2013 The Post-Grad Survival Guide \u2013 Medium", "tags": ["psychology", "inspiration", "self", "motivation", "startup"], "reading_time": 17, "text": "Mental models are frameworks that we can use to make sense of the world around us. In a reality as complex as ours, we need mental models to simplify concepts, make connections between ideas and identify important information from the surrounding sea of noise.\nCharlie Munger, Warren Buffett\u2019s less public (but no less successful) partner at Berkshire Hathaway, attributes much of his success to accumulating and applying hundreds of mental models.\nFor most of his life, Munger has been thinking about ways to think better. Rather than memorising isolated facts, he argues that you need to string facts together in a model or theory to organize them into a usable form. Importantly, your mental models need to come from a variety of disciplines and schools of thoughts so you can tackle problems in a three dimensional manner and avoid missing crucial information. No one model is perfect, but combining them gives you powerful toolkit to analyse information and make sound decisions.\nBelow are summaries of 8 mental models that I have found deeply interesting and useful. This is a very small cross-section of the thousands of models that are out there. Building this \u2018latticework\u2019 of mental models is a lifelong journey, and the quality of your thinking will be directly proportional to the strength of these models.\nOne of the first things you will have learned in maths is that anything multiplied by zero is zero. This is as true in life as it is in mathematics. Underlying this model is the concept of multiplicative systems.\nAt Google X, the \u2018moonshot factory\u2019 of the tech giant, the mantra is #MonkeyFirst. The idea is that if you want to train a monkey to stand on top of a pedestal and recite Shakespeare, you start by training the monkey, not by building the pedestal. Anyone can build a pedestal, but very few can figure how to teach a monkey the nuances of English literature. Even if you build the most beautifully designed pedestal there ever has been, the \u2018zero\u2019 factor of the monkey will mean that you have made no progress towards the actual goal.\nIn contrast, in an additive system, each component adds together to create the final outcome. If you add zero to a string of huge numbers, the result will still be huge. Take for example, a Christmas lunch, where different family members each bring a dish. If Aunt Rachel accidentally puts salt instead of sugar into her famous pudding, there will be a problem. But the dinner still goes ahead. The stuffed turkey, gravy, cranberry sauce and vegetables are all still good to go.\nThe addition or subtraction of different components creates a different outcome but not a binary win/lose outcome like a multiplicative system.\nMost businesses operate in multiplicative systems, but too often, think that they are operating in an additive one. Many companies continually add features to their product while neglecting to focus on key issues such as listening to customer feedback or gradually moving towards profitability. The infamous Pets.com spend millions on marketing and TV advertising without actually testing whether pet owners wanted to buy pet supplies online, resulting in one of the more public downfalls of the dot com crash.\nFor this reason, identifying whether you are in a multiplicative or additive system is hugely important. If the whole system depends on one or two critical components, it is essential that you address these components first.\nThe Pareto Principle is the idea that a very small number of key variables have a greater impact on the final result than all other variables combined. It is named after the economist Vilfredo Pareto who, in 1906, noticed that 20% of the people owned 80% of the land in Italy, much like how 20% of the pods in his garden produced 80% of his peas.\nThis pattern repeats itself over and over again in both the natural and social worlds. More than 35% of the world\u2019s population is concentrated in two countries. The most destructive earthquakes are much more powerful than smaller earthquakes combined. The largest companies in the world dwarf the value of every smaller business put together.\nThis 80/20 rule is used by venture capitalists when investing in startups. Peter Thiel, co-founder of Paypal and one of the most respected investors in Silicon Valley, calls this the power law. Venture returns are not normally distributed: that is, bad companies fail, mediocre ones stay flat and good ones return 2\u20135x. Rather, they follow a power law: a small handful of companies drastically outperform all others. For example in Thiel\u2019s fund, the 2005 Facebook investment returned more than all other investments combined.\nThis leads to a strange rule for venture capitalists: only invest in companies that have the potential to return the value of the entire fund. But because you can\u2019t know with certainty which companies will succeed, even the best venture capital firms have a \u2018portfolio\u2019 of 5\u20137 companies.\nThis type of thinking is also reflected in the value investment strategies of Buffett and Munger at Berkshire Hathaway. They make large bets on businesses they understand and predict will provide long-term returns. Extreme diversification only gives average returns.\nBut the power law is not just important to investors. It is important to everybody because everybody is an investor. An entrepreneur must decide where to invest her time, because she cannot diversify herself by running ten companies and hoping one of them succeeds. An individual can\u2019t diversify his career by keeping dozens of equally possible careers to fall back on. You should focus relentlessly on something you are good at and will have value in the future.\nPut all your eggs in one basket and watch that basket.\nA related model to the Pareto principle/power law concept is compounding. Compounding is the process by which interest is added to a fixed sum, which earns interest on the fixed sum plus the added interest and so on.\nIn A Random Walk Down Wall Street, Burton Malkiel gives an example of two brothers, William and James. William invests $4000 every year between the ages of 20 and 40 for a total of $80000. James invests $4000 per year but between the ages of 40 and 65, for a total of $100000. Despite investing $20000 less, at an interest rate of 6%, William ends up with $850,136 in his account, while James will have only $219,242. This is because William allowed his money to compound for 25 years.\nThe power of compounding applies far beyond the realms of finance. Knowledge compounds rapidly, since the more you read and digest, the more connections you can make across different ideas and fields, leading to a prosperous snowball effect.\nPart of the beauty of compounding is that it is neutral; it simply reinforces what exists. If you focus on improving just 1% a day, after a year you\u2019ll be 37 times better than you were at the start. But if you get 1% worse everyday, you decline to nearly zero after a year. What starts off as a small win or loss compounds into something much more significant when you factor in time. Its only when you look back across the years that you see the true impact of your good and bad habits.\nActivation energy is a concept originating from chemistry. The idea is that reactions need a certain amount of energy to get going. Just having two combustible elements is not enough.\nWe all have an intuitive understanding of how activation energy works. For example, we know that putting one lit match to a log won\u2019t start a fire, while using a flamethrower would be excessive. But there is a sweet spot in the middle which is just the right amount of heat required to get the fire going. This initial heat is the activation energy required for the reaction. As can be seen in the diagram below, reactions will only progress if the products are more stable than the reactants. In a fire, carbon in the form of wood is converted into a more stable form of carbon: carbon dioxide.\nDespite being rooted in chemistry, the concept of activation energy applies beautifully as a practical mental model. It is often said that getting started is the hardest part of doing something. We all need that little push or spark of motivation to sit down and start working, studying or writing that elusive first novel.\nDifferent people also have different activation energies. Take for example, university students who have been given an assignment. For some, simply being given the assignment information is enough impetus to start working on it. For others, it\u2019s reading an interesting article related to the assignment or seeing that their friend has started a few days ago. And for the vast majority, it\u2019s that impending sense of doom as the deadline approaches (as well as a few cans of Red Bull).\nI came across an interesting example of activation energy when reading Atul Gawande\u2019s book the Checklist Manifesto, in which he champions the use of simple, precise checklists in the medical profession. He argues that you can\u2019t just throw together a bunch of nurses and doctors and expect them to perform well as a team. But simply including a checklist, which directs each individual to introduce themselves and designates time for the group to pause and communicate, provides the activation energy to form the bonds of teamwork and drastically reduces error rates and complications during operations\nThe most important takeaway from this model is understanding that we often need a little push to get things going. Understanding how to give yourself this added motivation can be an extremely powerful tool.\nLeverage is the ability to apply force in a way which maximizes output per unit of input. The formal discovery of leverage is credited to Archimedes who famously stated:\nMany engineering feats have been accomplished through applied leverage. The Ancient Egyptians used levers to lift stones that weighed up to to 10 tons to build their pyramids and obelisks. We use levers everyday, in scissors, wheelbarrows, crowbars, pliers and even our jawbones.\nAgain, the concept of leverage applies practically, because it tells us that small, focused changes can make huge impacts on our lives. In this way, leverage is at the core of the popular piece of advice: work smarter not harder.\nWe can understand this better by referring again to the power law which suggests that 20% of the work produces 80% of the results. But, the secret is in the vertical part of the exponential curve below. In fact, 1% of work produces 50% of the results.\nThis suggests that focusing our time on the things that really matter is how we will get the best results, rather than taking a shotgun approach. That is, before you build a smart robot that can pick the highest apples in your orchard, check for low-hanging fruit.\nLeverage is also an extremely important concept in the business world. Anyone who has haggled in a street market intuitively understands this. You have to act like buying the vendor\u2019s product is a favour you\u2019re doing for them, rather than something you really want. Then you give them a lowball offer and wait for them to raise the price to something that\u2019s still a bargain before making the purchase.\nHaving monopoly power in a market provides huge leverage. That\u2019s why food is so ridiculously overpriced at stadiums and music festivals. You\u2019re already there and don\u2019t really have any other choice. Same goes for airline food and the rates charged by specialist surgeons and doctors. In Peter Thiel\u2019s book, Zero to One, he argues that achieving monopoly status is the only real way to grow rapidly scaling and wildly successful businesses. Google is effectively a monopoly in the online search market. Amazon is effectively a monopoly in online retail. Having this power gives them the leverage to set prices and capture a large proportion of the value they create.\nRegression to the mean was initially discovered in 1886 by Sir Francis Galton, a renowned polymath and half-brother of Charles Darwin. The rule is that in a normally distributed system, large deviations from the average will tend to return to that average with an increasing number of observations. This can often lead us to falsely attribute cause-effect relationships, such as when a patient gets better after taking herbal remedies or a tennis player\u2019s performance improves after being berated by her coach.\nDaniel Kahneman explores this concept (as well as a host of other logical errors and psychological biases) in his excellent book Thinking Fast and Slow.\nKahneman had a \u2018eureka\u2019 moment when he was teaching flight instructors in the Israeli Air Force about how rewards for improved performance work better than punishment of mistakes. A senior instructor disagreed, saying that whenever he praised cadets on their flight skills they would perform worse the next time, and when he criticized cadets for bad execution, their performance would immediately improve. Consequently, he rarely praised any students and was always ready to dish out criticism.\nKahneman instantly recognized that this was a perfect example of regression to the mean. Naturally, the instructor only praised cadets that performed far better than average. But the cadet was probably just lucky on that particular attempt and his performance would have deteriorated regardless of whether he was praised or not. Similarly, cadets were only criticized when their performance was far below average and thus likely to improve regardless of the instructor\u2019s actions.\nTo illustrate this, Kahneman drew a target on the floor and asked the instructors to turn their backs and throw two coins at it in immediate succession. In most cases, those who had done best on the first throw deteriorated on their second throw and vice versa. This is exactly what was happening with the flight cadets.\nAn easy way to correct for regression to the mean (particularly when conducting experiments) is to use control groups. For example, when testing the positive effect of energy drinks on depressed children, the control group would be depressed children that didn\u2019t receive an energy drink or even better, received a placebo (i.e. told to drink an energy drink that wasn\u2019t actually an energy drink). The control group improves by regression to the mean alone, which allows the experiment to determine whether the energy drink benefited children more than regression can explain.\nOur minds are strongly biased towards manufacturing causal connections (see narrative fallacy). Our associative memory looks for an easier explanation than simple regression to the mean. Thus, when interpreting data and predicting performance, we need to keep this mental model in mind to make sure that we do not make logical errors. Fortunately, awareness of regression to the mean is a great first step towards understanding the role of luck in success.\nThis is why we should always look out for track records rather than one-off successes or failures. An entrepreneur who has just sold off a multi-million-dollar company will likely not do so well in her second venture. But an entrepreneur who consistently produces innovative and world-changing ideas over long periods of time likely does have that extra element of skill.\nThe availability heuristic, like other heuristics of judgement, substitutes one question for another: instead of estimating the frequency of an event you report an impression of the ease with which individual instances come to mind.\nFor example, if you ask the friend of a recent divorcee about the rate of divorces for those over 50, they will report a much higher figure than someone whose friends are all in stable long-term marriages. In this way, the availability heuristic is not a model you want to implement, but one you want to recognize and avoid.\nA famous study of availability suggests that awareness of your own biases can lead to happier relationships. In the study, spouses were asked, \u201cHow large was your personal contribution to keeping the house tidy, in percentages\u201d. As expected, the combined percentages added to over 100%. Both spouses remembered their chores and and efforts much more saliently, leading to an increase in judged frequency. The same pattern applies for any group work, as most members feel that they have done more than their fairly allotted share.\nThis is one of the few systematic errors where there is high potential for successful \u2018debiasing\u2019. Being aware of the dangers of anecdotal evidence is a good first step. Relying on statistics and numbers also helps. For example, where several people feel that their efforts are not being recognized, simply observing that there seems to be more 100% of the credit to go around may be enough to defuse the situation.\nIn the 1990s, a German psychologist Norbert Schwartz conducted a study to find out what was more important in determining estimates of frequency: the number of instances retrieved or the ease with which they come to mind. Participants were asked to list instances of when they had been assertive and then rate their overall assertiveness. Some were asked to list six instances while others were asked to list twelve.\nInterestingly, he found that those asked to list twelve instances rated themselves lower in assertiveness. This is because recalling the first few instances was easy, but the drop of fluency between six and twelve suggested that the participant was not assertive overall. In this way, the availability heuristic that the subjects applied was more of an \u2018unexplained unavailability\u2019 heuristic. Even more interestingly, when some irrelevant explanation was given as to why fluency dropped, such as music playing in the background, participants rated themselves equally assertive when they retrieved twelve instances as when they retrieved six.\nThe media has a huge role to play in what is top of mind for the population. In a world so saturated with information, news outlets only report about long-tail, highly improbable events simply to grab our attention. No one watches a reporter talking about drab day-to-day stuff for half an hour, but they tune in to highly sensationalized stories about plane crashes, mass shootings and disease that make it seem like the world is falling apart. This can lead to an \u2018availability cascade\u2019, where a media story causes a powerful reaction, which then becomes a story in itself, prompting further discussion. Terrorists are the best practitioners of availability cascades. Deaths in plane hijackings are dwarfed by traffic deaths, but the gruesome images in the media are recalled far more quickly, making it difficult to apply reason. That\u2019s why I thought it was extremely commendable that New Zealand Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern refused to mention the name of the gunman in the recent shootings in Christchurch.\nThe media\u2019s sensationalist tendencies also mean that the most extreme and radical views get the most airtime. During the 2016 election, Trump presented us with a vivid narrative of Mexican immigrants bringing drugs, crime and rape. This led to political analysts spending more time discussing Trump\u2019s views, which further cemented them in the minds of the American population. Come election day, voters were more easily able to recall what Trump stood for and make judgements on whether or not to vote for him.\nThe margin of safety model has its roots in the disciplines of engineering and quality control.\nConsider a car part that is crucial to the functioning of the engine. Let\u2019s assume that the part is replaceable and lasts on average for 100 000 kilometres of driving. So at what point do we replace the part? The most cost efficient answer would be at 99 999 kilometres. But we don\u2019t know anything about the 100 000 kilometres the part has gone through. Were they 100 000 kilometres of rough terrain that wore out the part much quicker than expected? Or was the car just cruising along highways the whole time? We also don\u2019t know anything about the manufacturing process and any flaws in the 100 000 kilometre estimation.\nThat\u2019s why we start thinking of replacement at 70 000 kilometres and put a hard stop at 75 000 kilometres. That spare 25 000 kilometres is the margin of safety. Sticking with the car theme, that\u2019s also why you can keep going for a fair distance on an \u2018empty\u2019 fuel tank (check out Hamish and Andy\u2019s experiment here).\nI\u2019ve found a useful application of the margin of safety model when scheduling time to accomplish a particular goal or task. If an assignment, work task or personal goal needs to be accomplished by a certain date, I try and get it done a couple of days in advance. This provides enough leeway to get the work done should something unexpected throw a spanner in the works. Planning for the unpredictable helps you deal with it when it arises.\nClearly the margin of safety model is very useful both theoretically and practically. But it does come with the tradeoff of time and money. If we replace the aforementioned car part at 10 000 kilometres (and all similar parts), all cars would basically be fail-proof. But everyone would have to pay $70 000 for a Camry. We\u2019ve made the wise decision to accept a small chance of error so that we can all afford to drive around in the cars we want. Clearly, it is easy to see how pushing the margin of safety model beyond its limits completely nullifies its usefulness.\nThere could be just one tiny hiccup with the process of building your arsenal of mental models.\nAll mental models are wrong.\nBy definition, a model is a representation and simplification of reality rather than reality itself. When you try and boil down the messy complexities of the world into a principled framework, there are always going to anomalies and exceptions to the mental systems you have built.\nBut the real question here is how wrong do models have to be to not be useful? Even though they are simplifications of reality, we need models to anchor our understanding of the world around us. When we better understand the world around us, we can make better decisions using versatile principles.\nModels are helpful because they apply in a wide range of situations, not all situations. Weather forecasts often get it wrong, but that doesn\u2019t mean we shouldn\u2019t take an umbrella if it\u2019s predicted to be raining. City maps are often riddled with errors and missing streets, but roaming a foreign city without one would be foolish. We should prize usefulness and functionality over laser precision. In a world where only the perfect was tolerable, we wouldn\u2019t have any technology, art or science because everything is inherently uncertain. Humanity only progresses through relentless experimentation and research that irons out the flaws in previous iterations.\nThere will always be situations to which a particular mental model doesn\u2019t apply. That\u2019s why you should strive to keep adding to the list of mental models at your disposal, to ensure that you have a deep understanding of models that cross multiple disciplines.

Just two years later, the market grew to $255 billion \u2014 a whopping 138 percent growth within 2 years!\nBut there\u2019s something more. And it\u2019s not good.\nA study revealed that the average completion for Massive Open Online Courses \u2014 MOOCs \u2014 is a dismal fifteen percent.\nI\u2019ll admit. I\u2019m part of the 85 percent. Barring a couple, almost every online course I\u2019ve signed up for has stalled at the halfway stage.\nIt\u2019s not just online courses that lie unfinished. College degrees, novels, paintings, songs, projects... every day millions of goals get abandoned.\nNobody begins pursuing their goals with the idea of giving up. When people start something new, it feels amazing. They feel a surge of energy as they begin to shape their vision.\nBut as the work gets tougher, their effort declines for various reasons \u2014 new responsibilities, lack of time, too hard, \u201cjust can\u2019t do this right now.\u201d All these reasons boil down to one thing \u2014 aversion against discomfort.\nPeople value their comfort zone more than anything else, even money. That\u2019s why many of us enroll for courses that we don\u2019t complete, rent studios to do work that we never finish, and hire consultants and coaches to help us set goals that we never pursue.\nEveryone loves thinking about the outcome. What it will look like, how we will feel AFTER we\u2019ve achieved it. Daydreaming doesn\u2019t demand much. If anything, it keeps us in our comfort zone.\nBut taking action TO achieve the goal pushes us outside our comfort zone. And that\u2019s one thing we don\u2019t want to compromise on at all.\nWe want to get fitter, but we don\u2019t want to exercise.\nWe want to save money, but we don\u2019t want to change our spending habits.\nWe want to write a book, but we don\u2019t want to sit down at the table, think, and put the words on paper (or a document).\nWhen you set a goal but leave it midway, you do yourself more harm than good.\nFor example, each time you lose momentum, you have to work twice as hard to get back to your original rhythm. This Sisyphean feeling takes all the fun out of doing something for the love of it instead of love for the outcome.\nAlso, the vast chasm of feelings between the vicarious joy you experienced when you imagined the goal achieved and the secret disappointment you felt when you gave up make you feel like shit (and guilty).\nAnd you try to suppress this feeling of guilt and \u201cI\u2019m good for nothing\u201d by consuming more content, eating more junk food, wasting more time, and blaming the world for your condition.\nLook. If blaming the world helped people achieve their results, everyone would do it.\nOkay, almost everyone does it, but because it makes them feel better in the present moment. In the long run, it\u2019s as destructive as exposing yourself to outrages on social media every day.\nDo your future self a favor: Stop complaining and start doing just one key thing to stick to what matters.\nThe journey to a thousand miles starts with a single step. But you cannot reach the destination if you stop after ten steps.\nOn the other hand, continuing your journey doesn\u2019t demand that you turn into a superhero. It just demands that you take one step at a time.\nNot so tough, is it?\nYou don\u2019t need extreme self-discipline. You don\u2019t have to hole yourself up in the Batcave for ten hours a day. You don\u2019t have to give up on everything you enjoy.\nYou just have to show up every day. You just need enough self-discipline to stick to your average pace.\nYour average pace, according to James Clear, is what pushes you enough to make progress, but not so much that it becomes unsustainable.\nHere are some examples.\nIf you exercise thrice a week, you\u2019ll have exercised 72 times at the end of six months.\nIf you put 100 bucks in a cookie jar each day, you\u2019ll have saved 18,000 bucks at the end of six months, which you can invest in a mutual fund.\nIf you write one page for your book each day, you\u2019ll complete 180 pages at the end of six months.\nAs you can see, your average pace will produce long-term results that will make you feel proud of yourself.\nSticking to your average pace also has a hidden advantage It turns these actions into habits which, in turn, increase your average pace. And once you learn to stretch your limits in one aspect of life, you begin to apply it in every other aspect.\nSimple question, simple answer.\nWhen you want to buy a new mobile phone, you have two options for action.\nOne, you can gather mounds of information from friends and the internet, wait to check whether the rumors about new model launches are true, and drag your feet.\nBut that\u2019s not what you do, is it? You often follow the second option, which is:\nFollow the same regime for your actions.\nRead up about steps to begin what you want to. Then go on a content-fast: stop consuming content and start taking action. Keep the chain going. If you don\u2019t show up for two days in a row, make sure you don\u2019t miss the third.\nWhen you hit a wall, get information on it, go on a content-fast, and take action.\nRinse, repeat.\nI\u2019ll admit, doing so requires courage.\nTo hit the gym when you would rather veg out on the sofa and watch Netflix.\nTo save up when you would rather buy the latest smartphone model because your six-month-old phone feels outdated.\nTo write your book when your friends ask you to join them for Friday-evening parties.\nTo be called primitive for missing a few episodes of Game of Thrones because you were working on your goal.\nBut think about Future You. What will Future You thank you for one year, two years, five years down the line? For not compromising on your comfort zone? Or for showing up every day to do what you promised yourself you would?\nConsistency matures you. It\u2019s the best investment you can make in yourself.\nMove ahead, one step at a time, one day at a time. Gain a yard each day.\nA yard seems tiny now, but at the end of six months, you\u2019ll have crossed the football field.\nI write on aspects that will help you lead a more productive fulfilling life.

Even if you\u2019ve got your dream job, it\u2019s very likely that right now you could still be on a conference call you\u2019d rather skip, scheduling some meeting you\u2019re doing as a favor to someone else or dealing with some administrative detail you wish someone else would handle.\nOr maybe you\u2019re home from work and you\u2019re picking up around the house. Maybe you\u2019ve got some writing to do and the resistance is setting in. Or you\u2019ve got homework, an application to fill out or someone to fire or need to have difficult conversation with your significant other.\nIt\u2019s easy to blow these things off. It\u2019s tempting to phone them in. But you can\u2019t.\nBecause how you do anything, is how you do everything.\nLong past his humble beginnings, President Andrew Johnson would speak proudly of his career as a tailor before he entered politics. \u201cMy garments never ripped or gave way,\u201d he would say.\nOn the campaign trail, a heckler once tried to embarrass him by shouting about his working-class credentials. Johnson replied without breaking stride: \u201cThat does not disconcert me in the least; for when I used to be a tailor I had the reputation of being a good one, and making close fits, always punctual with my customers, and always did good work.\u201d\nAnother president, James Garfield, paid his way through college in 1851 by persuading his school, the Western Reserve Eclectic Institute, to let him be the janitor in exchange for tuition. He did the job every day smiling and without a hint of shame. Each morning, he\u2019d ring the university\u2019s bell tower to start the classes \u2014 his day already having long begun \u2014 and stomp to class with cheer and eagerness.\nWithin just one year of starting at the school he was a professor \u2014 teaching a full course load in addition to his studies. By his twenty-sixth birthday he was the dean.\nThis is what happens when you do your job \u2014 whatever it is \u2014 and do it well.\nThese men went from humble poverty to power by always doing what they were asked to do \u2014 and doing it right and with real pride. And doing it better than anyone else. In fact, doing it well because no one else wanted to do it.\nSometimes, on the road to where we are going or where we want to be, we have to do things that we\u2019d rather not do. Often when we are just starting out, our first jobs \u201cintroduce us to the broom,\u201d as Andrew Carnegie famously put it. There\u2019s nothing shameful about sweeping. It\u2019s just another opportunity to excel \u2014 and to learn.\nBut we are always so busy thinking about the future, we don\u2019t take enough pride in the tasks we are given right now. Too often we phone it in, cash our check, and dream of some higher station in life. Or we think, This is just a job, it isn\u2019t who I am, it doesn\u2019t matter.\nThis is foolishness.\nEverything we do matters \u2014 whether it\u2019s making smoothies to save up money or studying for the bar \u2014 even after we\u2019ve already achieved the success we sought. Everything is a chance to do and be our best. Only self-absorbed assholes think they are too good for whatever their current station requires.\nWherever we are, whatever we\u2019re doing and wherever we are going, we owe it to ourselves, to our art, to the world to do it well. That\u2019s our primary duty. And our obligation. When action is our priority, vanity falls away.\nAn artist is given many different canvases and commissions in their lifetime, and what matters is that they treat each one as a priority. Whether it\u2019s the most glamorous or highest paying is irrelevant. Each project matters, and the only degrading part is giving less than one is capable of giving.\nSame goes for us. We will be and do many things in our lives. Some are prestigious, some are onerous, none are beneath us. To whatever we face, our job is to respond with:\nWe should never have to ask ourselves, But what am I supposed to do now? Because we know the answer: our job.\nWhether anyone notices, whether we\u2019re paid for it, whether the project turns out successfully \u2014 it doesn\u2019t matter. We can and always should act with those three traits \u2014 no matter the obstacle.\nThere will never be any obstacles that can ever truly prevent us from carrying out our obligation \u2014 harder or easier challenges, sure, but never impossible. Each and every task requires our best. Whether we\u2019re facing down bankruptcy and angry customers, or raking in money and deciding how to grow from here, if we do our best we can be proud of our choices and confident they\u2019re the right ones. Because we did our job \u2014 whatever it is.\nYeah, yeah, I get it. \u201cObligations\u201d sound stuffy and oppressive. You want to be able to do whatever you want.\nBut duty is beautiful, and inspiring and empowering.\nSteve Jobs cared even about the inside of his products, making sure they were beautifully designed even though the users would never see them. Taught by his father \u2014 who finished even the back of his cabinets though they would be hidden against the wall \u2014 to think like a craftsman. In every design predicament, Jobs knew his marching orders: Respect the craft and make something beautiful.\nEvery situation is different, obviously. We\u2019re probably not inventing the next iPad or iPhone, but we are making something for someone \u2014 even if it\u2019s just our own resume. Every part \u2014 especially the work that nobody sees, the tough things we wanted to avoid or could have skated away from \u2014 we can treat same way Jobs did: with pride and dedication.\nThe great psychologist Viktor Frankl, survivor of three concentration camps, found presumptuousness in the age-old question: \u201cWhat is the meaning of life?\u201d As though it is someone else\u2019s responsibility to tell us. Instead, he said, the world is asking you that question. And it\u2019s our job to answer with our actions.\nIn every situation, life is asking us a question, and our actions are the answer. Our job is simply to answer well.\nRight action \u2014 unselfish, dedicated, masterful, creative \u2014 that is the answer to that question. That\u2019s one way to find the meaning of life. And how to turn every obstacle into an opportunity.\nIf you see any of this as a burden, you\u2019re looking at it the wrong way.\nBecause all we need to do is those three little duties \u2014 to try hard, to be honest, and to help others and ourselves. That\u2019s all that\u2019s been asked of us. No more and no less.\nSure, the goal is important. But never forget that each individual instance matters, too \u2014 each is a snapshot of the whole. The whole isn\u2019t certain, only the instances\nHow you do anything is how you can do everything. We can always act right.\nI\u2019ve created a list of 15 books you\u2019ve never heard of that will alter your worldview and help you excel at your career.\nGet the secret book list here!\nThis appeared on Thought Catalog.\n", "link": "https://medium.com/thrive-global/how-you-do-anything-is-how-you-do-everything-bc6e264e40ee", "author": "Ryan Holiday", "comments": [], "claps": "32K claps"}, {"num_comments": "unspecified", "title": "5 Crucial Truths You Must Accept to Dramatically Improve Your Life", "tags": ["personal development", "life lessons", "motivation", "psychology", "self improvement"], "reading_time": 10, "text": "Ambitious people are a dime a dozen. Most people doubt themselves. All of us \u2014 in some shape or form \u2014 are stuck in la la land.\nOne of the most difficult yet useful skills is the ability to balance your aspirations with reality. A pessimist and an idealist both miss the point.\nThe point is to have optimism about your future but look at the state of society, your environment, and your circumstances without rose-colored glasses.\nMany of these truths sit right under your nose. Intuitively you know they\u2019re true, but facing them head-on means discomfort.\nSuccess or failure in life comes from which type of discomfort you choose.\nYou can choose the discomfort of facing reality, making decisions to change, and having the difficult dialogue needed to do both.\nYou can also choose the discomfort of rationalizing your situation, lying to yourself, and making excuses.\nThe choice is yours. In my experience, and from what I\u2019ve observed, taking the discomfort upfront can feel horrible in the short run but rewarding in the long run. Pushing it away with the avoidance of truth alleviates discomfort in the short term, but it always comes back and persists until you do something about it.\nTake a look at the truths I\u2019m about to share with you. Technically, they are my opinions. You\u2019re free to disagree with them. Before you do, though, try to take a look at yourself and your situation honestly to determine whether you really disagree with me, or you\u2019re just hiding.\nHave you ever felt like your circumstances were trying to break you?\nJust when you\u2019ve improved your finances, your car breaks down. You wake up on the wrong side of the bed, come to work to a nagging boss and go home to an indifferent spouse.\nEvery time you take a step forward, you take three back. Inevitably, just as you\u2019re on the rise, something or someone tries to knock you down.\nIf only life would give you a little bit of a break, you tell yourself, you\u2019d have enough energy to make an effort to become successful.\nDeep down, you believe success provides an escape from life\u2019s problems. You figure if you had enough income, freedom, and positive experiences in your life...the bullshit would stop.\nIt doesn\u2019t and it never will.\nIn fact, when you push to do something outside of the box \u2014 start a business, write a book, become an artist, carve your own route \u2014 not only will things get worse before they get better, you\u2019ll still have to work to maintain what you\u2019ve achieved.\nPeople of all walks of life have problems. Billionaires have problems, Hollywood actors, the Dalai Lama all have problems. Around every corner, just when you think you\u2019ve won, life will find a way to see what you\u2019re made of.\nBut there\u2019s beauty in the struggle of life when you look at the right way. When life tests you, you get the chance to prove you\u2019re resilient. One of the deepest levels of satisfaction comes from knowing how strong you are. Few memories are better than those of overcoming struggles, persisting, and absorbing pressure and turning it into fuel instead of letting it break you.\nRealizing the world will constantly test you removes the element of surprise. When you find yourself in a bad spot, it feels doubly worse because you didn\u2019t see it coming.\nKnow that life is preparing its next right hook, but as Jim Rohn said, \u201cDon\u2019t wish it was easier. Wish you were Better. Don\u2019t wish for fewer problems. Wish for more skills.\u201d\nOur first reaction to pain and hardship \u2014 mine included \u2014 is to dwell on how much it sucks. A few of us, however, realize there\u2019s an opportunity to be had.\nIt\u2019s easy to say and difficult to do, but if you can learn how to transform pain into purpose you\u2019ll feel a type of happiness that is ten times better than the feeling of having a life devoid of difficulties.\nMaybe our purpose on this planet isn\u2019t to feel good. Maybe we\u2019ve been placed here to see what we\u2019re made of.\nAlmost every time life tests you, you won\u2019t want to find the opportunity in it. I never look positively at a challenge or hardship instantly, but after I\u2019m done sulking, I look to take a step in a positive direction.\nTry it. Over time, it works wonders.\nShould \u2014 what a simultaneously dangerous and useless word.\nPeople often use should in one of two ways \u2014 to give themselves an excuse for not doing something or for complaining about an unchangeable circumstance.\nA perfect world doesn\u2019t exist \u2014 the one without inequality, injustice, unfairness, superficial people, hate, greed, envy, lust, the list goes on.\nAre you using the world to avoid living in reality?\nMaybe you think you should be making more money. But you\u2019re not, and believing you should make more isn\u2019t going to change that. Finding a new job could change that. Improving your performance and negotiating a raise could change that.\nComplaining definitely won\u2019t.\nMaybe you think you shouldn\u2019t have to work twice as hard to achieve the same level of success as someone else. But what if you do have to work twice as hard? Are you going to wait for the scales of justice to even out? They won\u2019t.\nAgain, you can complain if you want, but complaining isn\u2019t a strategy. It doesn\u2019t do anything.\nThe same energy you use to rail against the way life should or shouldn\u2019t be could be used to improve your situation.\nShould also become dangerous when you talk about the things you aspire to do. \u201cI should start working out,\u201d you tell yourself. \u201cI should start working harder and being motivated.\u201d The minute you use the word in your head or out loud, you\u2019ve already lost. It gives you an out. You almost get a perverse satisfaction from thinking about doing something. It gives you the credit you don\u2019t deserve yet.\nInstead of talking about what you should do and the way the world should be, you\u2019re better off doing.\nDoers make change happen for themselves and for others. Doers don\u2019t have time to think about what they should or shouldn\u2019t do. They know what to do. If they don\u2019t, they gather enough information to have an idea of what to do and act on it.\nAsk yourself where the word should is causing harm in your life. Now, what are you going to do about it?\nWhen was the last time the government came to your rescue?\nThe answer is likely never. Yet we treat it like a savior or a demon when it\u2019s neither. It\u2019s a machine. An uncaring machine that\u2019s completely self-interested. Regardless, we make our way to the voting booths to ensure our guy or girl wins.\nLook at your own life. Has it changed dramatically between presidencies \u2014 not in terms of news coverage or your feelings about the president \u2014 but your actual life from day to day?\nAre you waiting for an employer to save you with a raise or magically improving your work environment? If so, you might be waiting for a long time.\nIt\u2019s easy to blame the government, your employer, or someone other than yourself for your woes. It\u2019s easier to say wages should be higher than to try to become more valuable.\nI\u2019m not saying the institutions of society are fair. They\u2019re definitely not. With the fleeting life you live, however, you don\u2019t have time to wait for institutions to save you.\nOdds are, you\u2019ll have to lift yourself out of your circumstances. Will it be easy? Hell no. But you really don\u2019t have a choice \u2014 not if you want to change your life.\nI know what you\u2019re thinking.\nYou were born poor, your parents didn\u2019t treat you well, you have a disability, you have a funny accent, you live in the wrong city, you\u2019re sick, your boss hates you, you have no money, you\u2019re a disabled veteran, you\u2019re black, you\u2019re a woman, you\u2019re gay, you\u2019re trans.\nYou\u2019re special. And because your circumstances are so unique, you couldn\u2019t possibly be to blame for your failures.\nDeep down we know we\u2019re the common denominator of all our problems, but it\u2019s hard to face. Why?\nBecause it means we\u2019re the ones who have to change our situations. And if we don\u2019t change our situations, we can only blame ourselves. Nobody wants to think they\u2019re the only real barrier to their own success, happiness, and well-being. It\u2019s easier to blame someone or something else.\nAnd no, I don\u2019t think you\u2019re lazy, mediocre, or \u201cdon\u2019t want it bad enough.\u201d It\u2019s genuinely difficult to take full ownership of your life. It can be uncomfortable or downright painful. The natural reaction is blaming someone other than yourself because your brain wants to protect you from harm and danger. But you can overcome these excuses.\nYou\u2019re in control of your life.\nAre you in control of what happens to you? No, but you\u2019re in control of how you react to what happens to you.\nYou choose how to react to situations, maybe not fully and consciously, but choose nonetheless.\nIf you don\u2019t take responsibility for your life, who will? I know how hard it is. Denial feels bad, but it hurts a little less than accepting the truth of your role in your own life.\nIf you go through the painful period of acceptance and get up from the floor, I promise greater things are ahead.\nI remember the first time I told my wife I wanted to start writing.\n\u201cI think it would be really fun to have a blog and start writing,\u201d I said.\n\u201cWell...why don\u2019t you start writing then?\u201d She replied.\nI knew I wanted to be a writer when I was 17 years old. I didn\u2019t start until I was 25. Maybe I was too immature to write anything of value until I\u2019d lived a little, but I still wonder how much further along I could be now if I started earlier.\nDid I make a declaration to become a writer, buy a typewriter, and lock myself in a room to write for hours? No.\nI started with one blog post...and I\u2019ve been writing nearly every day for years since. There\u2019s power in starting. You don\u2019t have to make a big deal out of starting a new project, just do it.\nSeriously, what are you waiting for?\nAre you waiting for the kids to grow older or move out so you can write that book?\nLeo Tolstoy had 13 kids when he wrote War and Peace.\nAre you waiting to have enough money to start your business?\nIf you have a good idea, there are various ways to start businesses at a low cost or find seed money. Oh, it\u2019s hard to find seed money? Well, starting a business is hard. Deal with it.\nAll salesmen know the phrase \u201cnow isn\u2019t the right time,\u201d is a lie. There\u2019s always a hidden objection behind the polite ones given such as lack of time, money, or ideal circumstances. The objection could be that the buyer doesn\u2019t trust the seller, they don\u2019t believe the product will deliver on its benefits, or they do believe in the product but not in themselves to get the most from it.\nThe way you self-talk is much like the relationship between a salesperson and a customer. You give yourself the polite out, but the truth is there\u2019s a deeper objection.\nWhat is it? You may not have even consciously thought of it yet. You really might believe in your own polite excuses. Until you dig deep to find the hidden reasons behind your behavior, you\u2019ll never change. I talk about this process at length in my book.\nWe all have deeply embedded beliefs about ourselves and about the world we live in \u2014 business is \u201crisky,\u201d intelligence and talent are fixed traits, finding a secure job will make us happy, others are luckier than you are, rich people steal, you\u2019re left or right brained and can\u2019t cross over, being healthy means depriving yourself, you must own a home and have kids, men are evil, women are evil, the list goes on and on and on.\nMany of these beliefs keep you from starting. You\u2019re not a \u201cnumbers person\u201d you tell yourself. Richard Branson has dyslexia and teachers labeled him learning disabled as a child \u2014 he\u2019s a billionaire.\nYou think you can\u2019t succeed because you\u2019re ill or have a disability. Jon Morrow \u2014 a man who cannot move anything below his neck \u2014 owns a multi-million dollar blog with a viewership of millions per month.\nI can find a counterexample to every excuse you have for not starting \u201cx.\u201dRather than argue with me about it, why not just start?\nThere\u2019s a lot of noise in the world. A lot of b.s. You can find success by seeing through it all.\nYou can wait for the world to change into the ideal state you want it to be, or you can learn to navigate it.\nThe people we call successful, they can see \u2014 through the limits, society tries to place on people, through the cliches that aren\u2019t true, through the joy-sucking prisons called institutions.\nCan you see now?\nI hope you decide to use the lens of truth to shape your decisions moving forward. It won\u2019t feel good right away, but it will feel amazing when you look back at all you\u2019ve done.\n", "link": "https://medium.com/mind-cafe/5-crucial-truths-you-must-accept-to-dramatically-improve-your-life-9e5dd1bac08e", "author": "Ayodeji Awosika", "comments": [], "claps": "217 claps"}, {"num_comments": 18, "title": "Only Intrinsic Motivation Lasts \u2013 Daniel Vassallo \u2013 Medium", "tags": ["technology", "lifestyle", "motivation", "work", "business"], "reading_time": 5, "text": "Last week I left my cushy job at Amazon after 8 years. Despite getting rewarded repeatedly with promotions, compensation, recognition, and praise, I wasn\u2019t motivated enough to do another year.\nI spent my entire time in AWS building tools for developers. I liked that field so much that I would have been satisfied working in it for the rest of my life.\nI joined Amazon as an entry level developer. Within 3.5 years I had been promoted twice to a senior engineer, and I was practically guaranteed another promotion to principal engineer this year if I had stayed. My potential at the company was high, I was told.\nMy esteem within the company grew along the years and I was regarded an expert and a leader in my field. People looked up to me and respected me.\nI made $75K in my first year and that gradually grew to $511K by my last year. I could have made another $1M if I stayed another couple of years.\nMy work\u2013life balance was good too, despite Amazon\u2019s reputation. I didn\u2019t need to prove myself anymore, and I could get everything done in 40 hours a week. My team worked from home one day a week, and I rarely opened my laptop at night or weekends.\nAlso, the people I worked with were exceptional. I had three managers in total, and all were generous people with lots of empathy. I\u2019m very grateful to everyone I worked with.\nEverything was going well and getting better. But despite all this, my motivation to go to work each morning was decreasing \u2014 almost in an inverse trend to my career and income growth.\nIt would have been foolish of me to expect my motivation to start increasing if I got yet another promotion, or another compensation bump, or another big project. But there was something else that was trending down with my motivation. It was my freedom.\nFor the first couple of years my motivation was off the charts. I was mostly working with another person on an internal tool, and there was very little scrutiny around it. It was a time where I had a lot of independence in choosing how to work and what to work on \u2014 at least relative to more recent years. It was just me and the other person improving this thing, talking to users, releasing updates, testing it, and everything else. Whatever we felt was important, we generally got to do. We did the best work we could for its own sake and we were mostly self-directed.\nThe last couple of years, however, were quite different. I was leading the most important project in the history of my department, with many stakeholders and complex goals. What I could do was always bounded by my ability to convince all the people involved that it was the best way to navigate our goals.\nI was always going to be working on somebody else\u2019s terms at Amazon. The terms were simple in the beginning (keep fixing the thing), but kept getting more complicated as the years passed by (maximize all goals; satisfy all stakeholders). Then there were other restrictions inherent to working in a large organization about how to do the work, what work to do, what goals to set, and what business was worth pursuing. This situation was squeezing me into doing things that I\u2019d rather not do, and vice versa.\nWhat kind of work would I do if I had to do it forever? Not something that I did until I reached some milestone (an exit), but something that I would consider satisfactory if I continued to do it until I\u2019m 80. What is out there that I could do that would make me excited waking up every day for the next 45 years that could also earn me enough money to cover my expenses? Is that too unambitious? I don\u2019t think so. Because there are two types of drivers that get me out of bed in the morning.\nOne comes from the outside in the form of a carrot or a stick. For instance, I\u2019m not automatically driven to do my tax returns every April, but I make sure I do because I don\u2019t want to go to prison. Or I might not want to work on something I dislike, but I do so anyway because I may need to pay the bills, or want to buy a fancy car. These are the extrinsic motivators.\nThe other comes from within. This is what drives me to do things when there isn\u2019t a carrot or a stick. Hobbies are one activity driven by this. But what I was looking for was something that I could do for a living that was also driven by this type of motivation: the intrinsic kind.\nBack to the question of whether this is too unambitious. See, I realized that extrinsic motivation doesn\u2019t last. Whenever I got promoted, it felt good for a week, and then it was as over. When I first hit $100K income, I would take a peek at my W2 for a few days admiring the six digits, but then it wore off. When I hit $200K, $300K, $400K, and $500K, it was the same thing. I would be delusional to think that earning $1M, or $10M would suddenly make it different. And I feel the same with every other extrinsic reward or material possession. Getting them feels good for a while, but this wears off quickly.\nThe things that don\u2019t wear off are those that I\u2019ve been doing since I was a kid, when nothing was forcing me to do them. Things such as writing code, selling my creations, charting my own path, calling it like I saw it. I know my strengths, and I know what motivates me, so why not do this all the time? I\u2019m lucky to live in a time where I can do something independently in my area of expertise without requiring large amounts of capital or outside investors. So that\u2019s what I\u2019m doing.\nI\u2019m going all in on independence, and I\u2019m going to try to make a living with my own bare hands starting from nothing. I don\u2019t expect to only do things that I like, but it will be on my terms. My target is to cover my family\u2019s expenses before I run out of savings while doing something that intrinsically motivates me. What more would I ever want to be satisfied with my work?\nIf you liked this article, I\u2019m going to be writing more about:\nNow that I can use Twitter without being subject to Amazon\u2019s social media policy, you can follow me there as I continue to document my journey.\nOriginally published at danielvassallo.com on February 9, 2019.\n", "link": "https://medium.com/@dvassallo/only-intrinsic-motivation-lasts-92c0497cf97c", "author": "Daniel Vassallo", "comments": ["Very good read.

That moment when there were no other roads, when you hit a dead end?\nAnd yet, here you are.\nWhen we\u2019re stuck in the midst of an emotionally charged event, our lives are consumed by this one particular thing. Whether it\u2019s rejection from a job we really wanted, being turned down by someone, or realizing that a project we invested time and money into was going nowhere, we\u2019ve all had those gut-wrenching experiences in which we fear life will always be worse.\nWhile those moments are painful, here\u2019s the good news: You\u2019ll survive. What\u2019s even better is that as time goes on, those experiences will be less and less significant in the grand scheme of things.\nSo if things aren\u2019t going your way, keep in mind these 10 things that won\u2019t even matter in 10 years\u2019 time:\nThere are times where you plan everything out carefully, take the necessary precautions, and proceed to...fall flat on your face. Afterward, you might feel ashamed, frustrated, or dejected.\nBut you know what? Life moves on.\nLike a river, we find a way around obstacles. Something that seems glaringly embarrassing right now will become barely even a blip years later. The more you try, the more you will fail. But you\u2019ll feel better for having tried. Eventually, those same failures will help you grow and become better.\nUncertainty is at the root of anxiety. When you worry, you imagine the possibilities that can unfold. What are people saying behind my back? What if I don\u2019t get the job I want? Am I ever going to get out of this bad situation?\nWhenever you\u2019re stuck at a crossroads, your mind worries about how things will turn out. Yet, the actual pain we experience usually isn\u2019t as bad as the pain we feel when we anticipate about it. Often, the worst case scenario doesn\u2019t even happen at all.\nOver time, you realize that worrying is an exhaustive activity that only drives you in circles. You learn to let things pan out and deal with issues as they crop up.\nWhen you were younger, there were clear markers of who was doing well compared to their peers. People could see who was getting the top grades, which college someone was accepted into, and so forth. But as time wears on, the concept of winning matters less.\nEveryone has their own road to travel. Each person has their ups and downs. At some point, it\u2019s hard to quantify who is doing better because everyone has their own value system. Determine what your values are and aspire towards those, as opposed to what others expect from you.\nThe weather. Other people\u2019s actions. The circumstances we were born into. These are only a few of the many things that are outside our control. Despite our ability to make decisions every waking second, there will always be some elements that can\u2019t be fixed.\nOften, you cannot force things to happen. One woman I knew said that every time she tried to force a connection with someone, she always regretted it. Eventually, we learn to recognize what is within our power to change, and to let go of what is outside our control.\nHave you ever really, really wanted something? You did whatever was within your power, only to not get what you wanted. You felt crushed at the time. Yet when you look back years later, you figure it was for the best.\nSure, it might be a case of \u201csour grapes\u201d. But the more likely reason for the mindset change is that what we wanted five, ten years ago is different from what we want today. We recover from disappointments and carry on because our needs and wants change. As we go through different stages of life, our priorities shift.\nRelationships matter. Having someone to support you, whether it\u2019s a friend, partner, or a mentor, goes a long way to improving your quality of life. Most importantly, it\u2019s the quality of those relationships that count.\nIn a study involving marriages and health, researchers found that good marriages correlate with longevity, while unhealthy marriages and being unmarried have the opposite effect. Why? Because not having those strong relationships leads to increased stress levels, poor dietary and exercise habits, and a lack of social support. In turn, the risk of heart attack and cancer increases.\nBeing in a toxic relationship or maintaining ties simply out of obligation wears you down and incites negative emotions. Eventually, you only keep in touch with those who matter the most and uplift you.\nRemember how social acceptance was critical to survival back in school? You had to contend with daily dilemmas such as the way you looked, the way you dressed, and the way you acted. While others\u2019 perceptions of us still matter as we get older, the way they matter changes with time.\nAt an earlier age, we strive to fit in. We try to conform to an acceptable mold. But as we move through life, we let go of conforming and create our own mold. We draw ourselves closer to those with similar values.\nNo matter what you do, some people will applaud you, some will criticize, and most won\u2019t care. With time, you care less and less about what others think and do what\u2019s best for yourself. Because, ultimately, it\u2019s your life that you\u2019re living.\nIt\u2019s easy to judge. You look at someone else and think: Why can\u2019t he just try harder? Why would she do that?\nSometimes, people make decisions that seem strange or downright crazy. I used to look at someone\u2019s actions and wonder why the person did that. But as I encountered similar situations, their actions started to make a lot more sense.\nAs you get older, you gain more experiences. Then, you look back at others\u2019 situations and realize that there was a reason behind their actions. You become less judgmental with time. After all, you won\u2019t fully understand unless you\u2019ve been in a person\u2019s situation.\nEveryone loves getting presents. When you hold up a shiny, new object for the first time, you feel a rushing surge of adrenaline. The problem is, those exciting feelings fade away. Your once bright object becomes another item in your home.\nIf you\u2019re buying an object for a specific use, that\u2019s one thing. But if you\u2019re buying something because you think it\u2019ll make you happy, you\u2019ll find your happiness short-lived.\nAs you get older, you start accumulating fewer objects. You begin to value experiences over physical possessions. In the end, you realize that those memories and the people you share them with stay with you.\nIn our fast-paced society, we\u2019re used to convenience. If you want to order food, talk to someone, or be entertained, simply turn to one of your electronic devices. When you want something, you want it now.\nThat might work when you\u2019re looking for a quick fix, but it doesn\u2019t work for the bigger goals. Patience is an undervalued trait today. Things often don\u2019t pan out immediately. When you try to fix a long-term issue with a short-term answer, you end up crashing and burning.\nTime often reveals the solutions you\u2019re looking for. As you get older, you learn that playing the long game is the fastest route. When you embrace learning, growth, and experiences, you might find yourself going down a route you had never expected.\n", "link": "https://medium.com/@melissachu/10-seemingly-important-things-that-wont-matter-in-10-years-c6293d6f1e4a", "author": "Melissa Chu", "comments": [], "claps": "976 claps"}, {"num_comments": "unspecified", "title": "How To Increase Your Willpower \u2013 Niklas Go\u0308ke \u2013 Medium", "tags": [], "reading_time": 9, "text": "Willpower is easy when you\u2019re having fun.\nI never needed anyone to tell me to play video games, explore the internet, or practice soccer tricks.

We are also excited to introduce AirShare for peer-to-peer file sharing and more great stuff in this next release.\nYou generate AirTime for yourself and publishers while actively browsing the Internet with the BitTube browser extension. Based on your AirTime you receive TUBE rewards daily. You may have noticed that your dashboard shows both \u201cAirTime\u201d and \u201ccounted AirTime\u201d. This is because AirTime is weighed based on cumulative activity throughout the day. Most of the time, your \u201ccounted AirTime\u201d is about half of your total daily activity. This difference increases the longer your online sessions become:\nThis where user account levels come in. Upgrading your account level will increase your counted AirTime and daily rewards for you and the websites you visit.\nAirTime requires either mobile verification or staking 2500 TUBEs to be considered verified and eligible for the \u201cAirTime Basic\u201d level. You can upgrade to \u201cPro\u201d or \u201cAddict\u201d levels which increases your total billable activity. The necessary staking amount depends on whether your account has gone through mobile verification. Being mobile verified means staking an extra 2500 or 25k TUBEs to unlock the Pro or Addict level, respectively. Foregoing mobile verification (out of privacy concerns, for example) requires 25k or 250k TUBEs to unlock these higher AirTime levels. The staking amounts are high by design, to protect the system against abuse from non-human accounts.\nNote (2019\u201304\u201317):Staking to bypass mobile verification has not been implemented yet. This feature will be announced in several weeks.\nThe \u201cbilling factor\u201d in the above chart depicts how much a user\u2019s AirTime is weighted according to their cumulative activity throughout the day. It is an essential spam prevention measure, making it economically unfeasible for non-human accounts (bots, click farms) to compete against normal human browsing behavior on a 24-hour basis. For example, the chart shows that the default \u201cBasic\u201d level counts only the first 2 hours (of your activity, not of your day) with a 1:1 weight. After this, increasingly less of your AirTime is counted towards rewards with each following hour, the maximum theoretical \u201ccounted AirTime\u201d being only 5 hours based on 24 hours of continuous activity (bottom left chart). The \u201cPro\u201d and \u201cAddict\u201d AirTime levels significantly increase the amount of maximum counted AirTime per day to roughly 9 and 14 hours. To the power users among you who sit behind a desk all day, upgrading your account will have a noticeable effect on rewards.\nEarlier this month we introduced the AirTime module. It allows publishers to earn from their guest visitors (i.e. users without the AirTime extension). As you might imagine, much stricter billing factors are applied to these users, since we are limited in verifying the legitimacy of each guest. Just like users, publishers have the ability to increase the counted AirTime from their guests by staking.\nThe AirTime levels for publishers start at \u201dFree Trial\u201d with an initial 10% billing factor which anyone is free to implement. It goes all the way up to the \u201cBusiness\u201d level, requiring 1 million TUBEs to unlock the maximum AirTime potential for each guest. The billing factor applies per guest who is identified by the system as unique across all AirTime-enabled websites. The \u201cVerified\u201d staking levels of 125k and above (bottom 4 graphs) will require KYC. This is meant for additional spam protection, as well as building an exclusive portfolio of trusted publishers. The biggest takeaway for publishers is that they are highly incentivized to convert their visitors into BitTube extension users, as they produce considerably more AirTime revenue compared to guests. Publishers should also realize that the dollar value of the TUBEs they earn is held up by utility, distribution and most importantly demand, which are the pillars of the browser extension. Later this year we plan to introduce advanced features for the AirTime module. For example, a paywall option that will allow you to set up on-demand content and premium pages on your website. For publishers powered by AirTime, this type of functionality will enable easy, universal, cross-platform paywall access for BitTube users based on micropayments or subscriptions.\nIn the \u201cMy wallets\u201d page in the extension you will find a \u201cStaking\u201d tab. Your \u201cOnline Wallet\u201d is your user wallet where staking increases your individual AirTime. The \u201cPlatform name\u201d wallets are meant for publishers who have registered their platform with the AirTime module.\nAfter you stake the desired amount, it will be locked for 30 days. When the first 30-day period ends, your stake will be auto-renewed with a 14-day time window to withdraw. After that, your stake will be locked for the remainder of the 30-day cycle, and so forth. All subsequent cycles will have a 14-day window to withdraw. Note: the locking period is for each transaction, based on the age of the transaction.\nThe staking funds will be stored on a dedicated wallet issued explicitly to upgrade your account level or AirTime module. The staking wallet uses a multi-signature address that can be operated only by 2 private keys. The use of a multi-signature wallet creates an additional layer of security to the staked funds and allows BitTube to lock the coins for established periods.\nTo generate a private key, you can choose between \u201cSimple generation\u201d where BitTube creates the address and gives you your private key, or an advanced option \u201cGenerate yourself\u201d where with the help of a BitTube client you create the address and provide the keys to the system.\nAfter creating the staking wallet, you have to deposit the required amount to obtain a certain level. Unlocking the deposit will be possible after the end of the first 30 day period upon withdrawal request.\nTo see precisely how much AirTime your linked (social) accounts and registered platforms are generating, we\u2019ve now added a new dedicated statistics tab!\nEvery donation button now includes a \u201cBuy TUBEs\u201d option where a sidebar popup will show all available payment methods. The donation amount will be represented in the fiat currency set in your extension profile.\nThe sidebar offers fast and easy way to get some TUBE in your balance. Later on this functionality will be implemented as an option for guest on websites with integrated AirTime module.\nWho needs clunky cloud storage solutions when you can share files instantly and peer-to-peer? Welcome to AirShare! Share unlimited files with anyone and start your decentralized torrent network with our open source solution based on the WebTorrentprotocol.\nCheck it out at airshare.bittubeapp.com. You can drag and drop any file and you seed it as long as the browser tab is open. It\u2019s open source and we encourage anyone to implement it inside their own website by just copying a few folders to their host. Next, register the AirTime module to generate TUBEs when visitors are seeding and downloading, and you\u2019ve got yourself a purely decentralized peer-to-peer, monetized file sharing economy. These are the true building blocks of censorship-resistant content sharing.\nThe AirShare application is optimized for performance and is more lightweight than the stock WebTorrent code base. All generated URL hashes (the characters following the # symbol) can be used with any other WebTorrent based client such as instant.io.\nLike BitTube\u2019s CEO says:\nThe main reason for developing the AirShare system was to provide more freedom and additional protection layers for the content on the upcoming BitTubers Social Hub platform (bittubers.com). Since any platform, including ours, will have reasons (but more importantly, the means) to remove posts containing certain content (be it illegal or for violating copyright or guidelines), AirShare provides protection for censored content for as long as the author or other users are seeding it, transferring the burden of accountability to the users. Like Jordan Peterson says: take responsibility and it will set you free.\nThe BitTubers Social Hub is expected to release in early beta at the end of Q2, where the current bit.tube video platform will migrate to the new network.\nWith each passing day we move closer to providing everyone with the building blocks that give back the freedom and autonomy on the Internet that is sorely needed in this modern world. We\u2019re looking at you, Article 13.\nCan\u2019t wait for the next update!\nYour BitTube Team\n", "link": "https://medium.com/@Bit.Tube/staking-and-airshare-17106754b4b8", "author": "Bit Tube Official", "comments": [], "claps": "489 claps"}, {"num_comments": 2, "title": "The Future of Social Media in 2019 \u2013 UtopiaPress \u2013 Medium", "tags": ["social media", "technology", "facebook", "media", "business"], "reading_time": 5, "text": "Somewhere along the line advertising created a more toxic version of what social media could have been.\nA world where social media lost its soul of actually being social.\nA world where open sharing meant people became the product.\nA world where time spent on social media was detrimental to our mental health and civic unity, social media became a divider on issues, between groups and ideologies, political or otherwise.\nI\u2019m not going to tell you the future of social media is bright here. Last year in 2018, I warned about this trend in what was my most viral article on Medium in a long time:\nWe\u2019ve gone from social sharing to spammy stories, and a great exodus from Facebook has taken place especially in North America and Europe.\nFacebook thinks the future of social media will feel more like this: RIP, \u201ctown square.\u201d Hello, \u201cliving room.\u201d\nThat sounds more like my growing relationship to Alexa and Google Assistant, not how I interact online.\nMark Zuckerber\u2019s grand vision for pivot to Chat-Privacy and Encrypted walled garden communities mirrors what Apple is doing to build its Services business.\nThe future of the internet might be more about Amazon becoming a serious Ad-player to upset the duopoly of Facebook and Google. The future of social media feels more like TikTok, than if WhatsApp can monetize or if we\u2019ll really want to buy online via Instagram Commerce.\nSocial media is no longer about broadcasting to an \u201copen-network\u201d. It\u2019s no longer just about harvesting the data of unsuspecting users for profit.\nSocial media needs to be more about co-creating. This is what makes TikTok so popular, there are layers of memes and funny things you do with the interface. TikTok is rapidly approaching Instagram like numbers in Asia. It\u2019s made by ByteDance, a Chinese tech unicorn.\nHuge platforms like Facebook, LinkedIn and Twitter are seeing less engagement \u2014 with a wide range of new niche platforms coming into being stealing the attention and devotion of Gen Z, those digital natives today in the world 23 and younger.\nZuckerberg\u2019s reality of monopolies seems to be in decline. No matter how profitable Facebook and Google continue to be, something has shifted in the way the world shares.\nFacebook\u2019s related decision to unite its messaging kingdom, enabling interoperability between Messenger, Instagram and WhatsApp is basically a move towards monetization and centralization \u2014 basically what young people dislike the most about these apps.\nYoung people today prefer decentralized and peer-to-peer interactions outside a system of attention control based on Advertising. Instagram in this light, may be more symbolic of the past, than the future. Instagram today in 2019 is essentially an ecosystem of fake engagement and attention hijacking that no longer reflects the future of apps.\nIn China, messaging app WeChat is already an institution with more than a billion users. In Asia, mini programs are the new app stores and funnel real services that consumers can access in a more more pragmatic internet. In China there are super apps that do not even exist in the West.\nIn 2017 we could have talked about the \u201cauthenticity\u201d movement of social media seriously, in 2019 it\u2019s mostly sponsored content and vanity metrics addiction, a weird kind of digital dopamine that keeps creators hooked and sharing. It\u2019s basically a history of how apps were engineered to steal our time and monetize us on a dollar per user basis.\nIn 2019, there\u2019s a lot more awareness about the mental health risks of using apps too much, no matter how good or social they might make us feel, they all have a dark side.\nA move to walled gardens by Facebook or Apple doesn\u2019t essentially make the world a better place or uplift the failure of social media or other services. These are strictly business decisions to be more profitable and have more control over their own users and consumers.\nFacebook\u2019s business model is built around collecting user data and then selling highly targeted ads. But Snapchat, Apple and even Google is show gaming is the future of social media and walled garden ecosystems. Amazon\u2019s Twitch streaming for gaming enthusiasts is already an incredible success the likes of Microsoft have failed to replicate.\nPublic social networks will continue to be very important in people\u2019s lives yet the quality of noise and the abundance of trolling in Facebook Groups, Reddit, Twitter has gone up, not down. Anonymous users can do and say anything without these networks censoring or punishing them. Most of the people I know have either quite Facebook or operate on its with aliases in 2019.\nToday we already see that private messaging, ephemeral stories, and small groups are by far the fastest growing areas of online communication. But Facebook\u2019s reputation has been significantly hurt. The ethics around its app products have shown a disregard for privacy that makes their pivot into privacy hard to accept or take seriously.\nSuccessive privacy scandals and fights with regulators may have accelerated Facebook\u2019s push to messaging. However with the likes of Telegram, Line and others getting into cryptocurrency, I suspect I will be spending less time on things like WhatsApp in the years to come. With or without a Facebook stablecoin that operates as a peer-to-peer transfer system to monetize WhatsApp. Square, Venmo or Zelle are already pretty good. WeChat is already quite appealing.\nFacebook didn\u2019t bring us a town-square, it brought us an era of smartphone and app addiction. There\u2019s no regulatory body in the world capable of giving out the fines for the mental health and productivity costs of these things, only advertising profits for Silicon Valley itself. How do you have meaningful progress or innovation on a Western internet addicted to apps and advertising revenue? How do you have Media companies that can survive the cannibalization of our attention with algorithms? You don\u2019t.\nThat\u2019s why you see so many paywalls and walled gardens popping up. It\u2019s a signal that the town-hall mode of social media has failed. It was detrimental to the media industry, misinformation, and division in society caused by an unregulated internet. The future of social media is as much about correcting what Facebook did wrong, as anything else.\nThe future of communication will increasingly shift to private, encrypted services where people can be confident what they say to each other stays secure and their messages and content won\u2019t stick around forever. This is what makes less popular apps like Snapchat actually more appealing than more dominant apps used by the crowd and mob.\nFacebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Instagram and other \u201cpublic\u201d platforms will continue to play a vital role but they have failed to self-regulate. They are at your own risk type platforms, full of trolls, deadbeats and digital addicts. They might just continue to decline from 2020 onwards as new ecosystems begin to take their place. That\u2019s not the rise of privacy, that\u2019s just the evolution of social media.\n", "link": "https://medium.com/utopiapress/the-future-of-social-media-in-2019-37ab7cef8b03", "author": "Michael K.

Now they are among the most valuable and well-known companies in the world. It\u2019s a great story \u2014 but also one that highlights why the government must break up monopolies and promote competitive markets.\nIn the 1990s, Microsoft \u2014 the tech giant of its time \u2014 was trying to parlay its dominance in computer operating systems into dominance in the new area of web browsing. The federal government sued Microsoft for violating anti-monopoly laws and eventually reached a settlement. The government\u2019s antitrust case against Microsoft helped clear a path for Internet companies like Google and Facebook to emerge.\nThe story demonstrates why promoting competition is so important: it allows new, groundbreaking companies to grow and thrive \u2014 which pushes everyone in the marketplace to offer better products and services. Aren\u2019t we all glad that now we have the option of using Google instead of being stuck with Bing?\nToday\u2019s big tech companies have too much power \u2014 too much power over our economy, our society, and our democracy. They\u2019ve bulldozed competition, used our private information for profit, and tilted the playing field against everyone else. And in the process, they have hurt small businesses and stifled innovation.\nI want a government that makes sure everybody \u2014 even the biggest and most powerful companies in America \u2014 plays by the rules. And I want to make sure that the next generation of great American tech companies can flourish. To do that, we need to stop this generation of big tech companies from throwing around their political power to shape the rules in their favor and throwing around their economic power to snuff out or buy up every potential competitor.\nThat\u2019s why my administration will make big, structural changes to the tech sector to promote more competition \u2014 including breaking up Amazon, Facebook, and Google.\nHow the new tech monopolies hurt small businesses and innovation\nAmerica\u2019s big tech companies provide valuable products but also wield enormous power over our digital lives. Nearly half of all e-commerce goes through Amazon. More than 70% of all Internet traffic goes through sites owned or operated by Google or Facebook.\nAs these companies have grown larger and more powerful, they have used their resources and control over the way we use the Internet to squash small businesses and innovation, and substitute their own financial interests for the broader interests of the American people. To restore the balance of power in our democracy, to promote competition, and to ensure that the next generation of technology innovation is as vibrant as the last, it\u2019s time to break up our biggest tech companies.\nAmerica\u2019s big tech companies have achieved their level of dominance in part based on two strategies:\nWeak antitrust enforcement has led to a dramatic reduction in competition and innovation in the tech sector. Venture capitalists are now hesitant to fund new startups to compete with these big tech companies because it\u2019s so easy for the big companies to either snap up growing competitors or drive them out of business. The number of tech startups has slumped, there are fewer high-growth young firms typical of the tech industry, and first financing rounds for tech startups have declined 22% since 2012.\nWith fewer competitors entering the market, the big tech companies do not have to compete as aggressively in key areas like protecting our privacy. And some of these companies have grown so powerful that they can bully cities and states into showering them with massive taxpayer handouts in exchange for doing business, and can act \u2014 in the words of Mark Zuckerberg \u2014 \u201cmore like a government than a traditional company.\u201d\nWe must ensure that today\u2019s tech giants do not crowd out potential competitors, smother the next generation of great tech companies, and wield so much power that they can undermine our democracy.\nRestoring competition in the tech sector\nAmerica has a long tradition of breaking up companies when they have become too big and dominant \u2014 even if they are generally providing good service at a reasonable price.\nA century ago, in the Gilded Age, waves of mergers led to the creation of some of the biggest companies in American history \u2014 from Standard Oil and JPMorgan to the railroads and AT&T. In response to the rise of these \u201ctrusts,\u201d Republican and Democratic reformers pushed for antitrust laws to break up these conglomerations of power to ensure competition.\nBut where the value of the company came from its network, reformers recognized that ownership of a network and participating on the network caused a conflict of interest. Instead of nationalizing these industries \u2014 as other countries did \u2014 Americans in the Progressive Era decided to ensure that these networks would not abuse their power by charging higher prices, offering worse quality, reducing innovation, and favoring some over others. We required a structural separation between the network and other businesses, and also demanded that the network offer fair and non-discriminatory service.\nIn this tradition, my administration would restore competition to the tech sector by taking two major steps:\nFirst, by passing legislation that requires large tech platforms to be designated as \u201cPlatform Utilities\u201d and broken apart from any participant on that platform.\nCompanies with an annual global revenue of $25 billion or more and that offer to the public an online marketplace, an exchange, or a platform for connecting third parties would be designated as \u201cplatform utilities.\u201d\nThese companies would be prohibited from owning both the platform utility and any participants on that platform. Platform utilities would be required to meet a standard of fair, reasonable, and nondiscriminatory dealing with users. Platform utilities would not be allowed to transfer or share data with third parties.\nFor smaller companies (those with annual global revenue of between $90 million and $25 billion), their platform utilities would be required to meet the same standard of fair, reasonable, and nondiscriminatory dealing with users, but would not be required to structurally separate from any participant on the platform.\nTo enforce these new requirements, federal regulators, State Attorneys General, or injured private parties would have the right to sue a platform utility to enjoin any conduct that violates these requirements, to disgorge any ill-gotten gains, and to be paid for losses and damages. A company found to violate these requirements would also have to pay a fine of 5 percent of annual revenue.\nAmazon Marketplace, Google\u2019s ad exchange, and Google Search would be platform utilities under this law. Therefore, Amazon Marketplace and Basics, and Google\u2019s ad exchange and businesses on the exchange would be split apart. Google Search would have to be spun off as well.\nSecond, my administration would appoint regulators committed to reversing illegal and anti-competitive tech mergers.\nCurrent antitrust laws empower federal regulators to break up mergers that reduce competition. I will appoint regulators who are committed to using existing tools to unwind anti-competitive mergers, including:\nUnwinding these mergers will promote healthy competition in the market \u2014 which will put pressure on big tech companies to be more responsive to user concerns, including about privacy.\nProtecting the future of the internet\nSo what would the Internet look like after all these reforms?\nHere\u2019s what won\u2019t change: You\u2019ll still be able to go on Google and search like you do today. You\u2019ll still be able to go on Amazon and find 30 different coffee machines that you can get delivered to your house in two days. You\u2019ll still be able to go on Facebook and see how your old friend from school is doing.\nHere\u2019s what will change: Small businesses would have a fair shot to sell their products on Amazon without the fear of Amazon pushing them out of business. Google couldn\u2019t smother competitors by demoting their products on Google Search. Facebook would face real pressure from Instagram and WhatsApp to improve the user experience and protect our privacy. Tech entrepreneurs would have a fighting chance to compete against the tech giants.\nOf course, my proposals today won\u2019t solve every problem we have with our big tech companies.\nWe must give people more control over how their personal information is collected, shared, and sold \u2014 and do it in a way that doesn\u2019t lock in massive competitive advantages for the companies that already have a ton of our data.\nWe must help America\u2019s content creators \u2014 from local newspapers and national magazines to comedians and musicians \u2014 keep more of the value their content generates, rather than seeing it scooped up by companies like Google and Facebook.\nAnd we must ensure that Russia \u2014 or any other foreign power \u2014 can\u2019t use Facebook or any other form of social media to influence our elections.\nThose are each tough problems, but the benefit of taking these steps to promote competition is that it allows us to make some progress on each of these important issues too. More competition means more options for consumers and content creators, and more pressure on companies like Facebook to address the glaring problems with their businesses.\nHealthy competition can solve a lot of problems. The steps I\u2019m proposing today will allow existing big tech companies to keep offering customer-friendly services, while promoting competition, stimulating innovation in the tech sector, and ensuring that America continues to lead the world in producing cutting-edge tech companies. It\u2019s how we protect the future of the Internet.\nWe can get this done. We can make big, structural change. But it\u2019s going to take a grassroots movement, and it starts right now.

The emergence of Neural Architecture Search (NAS) can optimize models with more elaborate wiring and operation types. Although this has made NAS a promising research direction, a NAS network generator still must be hand-designed, and the search space is constrained. In a new Facebook AI Research (FAIR) study, researchers explore a more diverse set of connectivity patterns through randomly wired neural networks. The experiments achieve a satisfying result, outperforming human-designed networks such as ResNet and ShuffleNet in image recognition tasks.\nSynced invited Tongliang Liu, an Assistant Professor who focuses on Machine Learning and Computer Vision at the University of Sydney, to share his thoughts on the FAIR\u2019s Exploring Randomly Wired Neural Networks for Image Recognition.\nHow would you describe randomly wired neural networks?\nDesigning efficient and effective architectures of neural networks is crucial for the development of deep learning. Kaiming He and his team from Facebook AI Research (FAIR) have been in the forefront of the area. After developing Deep Residual Networks (ResNets), they recently proposed Randomly Wired Neural Networks with a novel way to wire neural networks.\nRandomly Wired Neural Networks are not entirely randomly generated. They still include some human-designed structures, i.e., the networks are manually divided into stages with progressively downsampled representations. However, this differs from the traditional networks in that the node connections in each stage are randomly generated rather than human-designed. Specifically, stochastic network generators (SNGs) with random seeds are designed to randomly generate graphs which are then subsequently mapped into computable stages. It is very interesting that some Randomly Wired Neural Networks with specific SNGs outperform or are comparable to state-of-the-art networks. I have to note that those SNGs are designed by employing classical families of random graph models in graph theory to reduce bias from the network designers, showing that exploring SNGs with prior knowledge could be a promising research direction for network designing.\nWhy does this research matter?\nDeep neural networks with different wiring patterns and operations are powerful in processing data and learning new representations. The way networks are wired will have a big influence on their performances as well as their properties. Currently, the well-known wiring patterns include full wiring and some human-designed wiring. Because of problems such as very large hypothesis class and non-convexity, fully connected networks, e.g., Multilayer Perceptron (MLP), fail to provide leading performances in some applications; while some networks with human-designed wiring, such as Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) and their variants (e.g., ResNet and DenseNet) that have constraints on their wiring patterns, obtain dominant results in some specific tasks, e.g., image classification. One natural question which arises is whether any better wiring patterns exist. Or what is the optimal pattern? Recently, Zoph et al. proposed Neural Architecture Search (NAS) to learn wiring patterns directly on the interested dataset using reinforcement learning, while Randomly Wired Neural Networks make another big step forward by successfully showing that even randomly wired networks have exceptional performances and that there may be a large room for the improvement of network wiring.\nWhat impact might this research bring to the research community?\nThe research opens a new door for designing architectures of neural networks. I would like to quote the authors\u2019 claim: the research suggests a new transition from designing an individual network to designing a network generator may be possible (given that several variants of SNGs output networks with competitive accuracies on ImageNet and that the variance of accuracy is low for different SNGs), analogous to how our community have transitioned from designing features to designing a network that learns features. Randomly Wired Neural Networks have notable performances on image classification. They may also have noteworthy performances on classification-related vision tasks, such as image segmentation, object detection, and depth estimation.\nCan you identify any bottlenecks in the research?\nAlthough Randomly Wired Neural Networks have remarkable performance, the mathematical foundations of SNG remain elusive. Why could SGNs lead to state-of-the-art performances? Why different SGNs have different performances? What are the roles of SNGs in feature learning? They lack mathematical interpretation. Currently, we do not know the underlying principles that guarantee their success. It may be hard to deliberately adapt a SNG for achieving different purposes or pertinently strengthen its generalisation ability.\nCan you predict any potential future developments related to this research?\nThe research would definitely evoke interest from the community in exploring innovative SNGs. Other than employing the families of random graph models from graph theory, designing random graph models pointedly for specific tasks is also expected. Incorporating different prior knowledge into SNGs and studying their wiring spaces should be a future direction to construct effective generators.\nThe paper Exploring Randomly Wired Neural Networks for Image Recognition is on arXiv.\nAbout Prof. Tongliang Liu\nTongliang Liu is a Lecturer (Assistant Professor) in Machine Learning with the School of Computer Science at the University of Sydney, and a core member of the UBTECH Sydney AI Centre.

A good many of them, anyway. I\u2019d venture to say that about 85% of the people who \u201cfriended\u201d me on Facebook wouldn\u2019t know a true friend from SpongeBob.\nI\u2019m thinking of one in particular who was just let go from my former place of employ. She was a co-worker and we always got along due to our shared love of animals. We both have cats and our fab felines proved to be the common ground that bonded us.\nOn other fronts, we couldn\u2019t be more opposite and I\u2019m cool with that. To each his own, after all. She leans toward the Christian right and I am certain she supports the Orange Troll in the White House. I am a lefty through and through. I smoke weed. I can cuss like a longshoreman. And I call out bullshit when I can no longer stand the stench.\nI was laid off last February. Never...NOT ONCE did this woman check in with me to see how I was doing. She wasn\u2019t the only one.\nI wrote a story about that for Publishous. You can check it out here.\nHere is where things get shitty. This woman was laid off a couple of weeks ago and, the very day she was sent packing, she sent me a text with a sort of \u201cGuess what?\u201d message. Did it ever cross her mind that maybe I wouldn\u2019t be all that jazzed to hear from her? After more than a year of silence?\nHell. Ignorance really is bliss. I sent her a brief \u201cSorry about that message\u201d back. Then, because every now and again, I remember that I\u2019m supposed to be a human being, I thought I\u2019d give her another go. I could relate to how upset she was and my husband suggested I take the high road. So, I invited her to an outing with some former work mates.\nIn response, this \u201cformer friend\u201d declined, saying she had an appointment and then a class. This has been her typical response to similar invites over the years.\nReading her email, I decided it was time to part ways. All her endless status updates and photos of herself with other, \u201creal\u201d friends kickin\u2019 it at various bars. My immediate response was to unfriend her and it felt fantastic. So fantastic, in fact, that I. plan to disengage with other pseudo buds.\nThink about it. When you scroll through Facebook, don\u2019t you sometimes feel a tinge of annoyance at the glut of inane photos, posts and navel-gazings from \u201cfriends\u201d you never physically see, or even, speak with? Why put yourself through that? There\u2019s something a bit masochistic about constantly subjecting oneself to that kind of rejection. And, in a sense, rejection it is.\nLike the loner in the schoolyard who\u2019s never asked to play Dodge Ball with the rest of the kids.\nFor years, I never paid attention to Facebook. Basically, I joined and forgot about it. Then, as my sister\u2019s kids grew, I paid more attention to what was going on in their lives. I love seeing their pics and keeping abreast to their goings on. My sister posts pics of her three dogs, too, which always gives me a giggle.\nAnd these days, as I struggle with being chronically \u201cunemployable,\u201d and promoting my screenplays and blogs, I need giggles. As many as I can get.\nFacebook is also a place where I promote my \u201cbrand\u201d as a writer. And I unashamedly admit that I love to get \u201clikes\u201d for my stories from my true friends. And they\u2019re out there.\nAfter thinking about it, I did let the woman in question know how I felt. I very politely told her that, as she hadn\u2019t contacted me in over a year, and couldn\u2019t be bothered to meet with me, that I would no longer be in touch. I wished her the best, then immediately sent her into the void.\nOne click is all it took.\nBecause people do and say things in the heat of anger that they later regret, I\u2019m not suggesting that you wipe out three quarters of your FB friends. Everyone\u2019s experience is different. In mine, I realized that this woman really didn\u2019t care about me and only reached out for sympathy at her losing her job. Tough beans. Been there, done that.\nWhat about you? Is there someone who used to be a friend, but no longer is? Until you make the decision that a clean break is in order, you can always \u201cunfollow\u201d them. Unfollowing is different from unfriending. Facebook says that this means that you are still friends, but you won\u2019t receive updates from them on your News Feed. Hurrah to that!\nThe flip side of unfollowing is that it\u2019s sort of passive-aggressive. In a sense, it\u2019s taking the easy way out. But only you can determine that.\nThere\u2019s yet one more option under the \u201cunfriend\u201d and \u201cunfollow\u201d menu for people who need people...to just, go away for a while. You can take a break! How cool is that? Taking a break will limit what you see from that person. If your curiosity gets the better of you, you can still go to their page and read their posts. They just won\u2019t pop up, anymore.\n", "link": "https://medium.com/the-daily-rant/unfriend-someone-today-1fd0a0d2769", "author": "Sherry McGuinn", "comments": [], "claps": "218 claps"}, {"num_comments": 3, "title": "Please Mr. Zuckerberg, May I Have Some More Pageviews?", "tags": ["social media", "facebook", "satire", "humor", "marketing"], "reading_time": 3, "text": "Please, Mr. Zuckerberg, sir.

It will be so much harder to keep in touch.\u201d It wasn\u2019t. I wrote down all the emails of those I cared to stay in touch with that I didn\u2019t have the contact details for. Out of several hundred friends I ended up writing down only 30 names.\nThat same year I replaced Facebook with Twitter. It was a different experience. More detached learning and professional sharing, less emotional rabbit holes. A few years later I moved again \u2014 without Facebook \u2014 where I had a job that was big on social media. I had to have a Facebook account so I eventually gave in and made an account. This time I thought it would be different. I made all these rules and set all these boundaries to keep me in control. I said to myself, if I used it like LinkedIn then it would be ok, it wouldn\u2019t be addictive \u2014 because if there is one thing we can agree on is that LinkedIn is definitely not addictive. I didn\u2019t friend anyone that I was actually friends with, unless they were a professional link. I also never installed the app on my phone, used Messenger, played Facebook games, took any quizzes, or used my account to log into websites.\nThis went on for a couple of years. I eventually friended friends. And then friends of friends. But the other rules remained.\nThen there is the train wreck that is Facebook, the tech giant. Supporting authoritarian governments, its posts inciting the Rohingya genocide in Myanmar, and the Facebook - Cambridge Analytica scandal (now Emerdata Ltd., a part of the SCL Group) that influenced over 200 elections, including in Nigeria, the Czech Republic and Argentina. Acquiring everyone from Whatsapp to Instagram, to now publicly merging the three. And all the other data scandals plus the latest one. No one can keep up anymore.\nBut I thought as long as I can use it to share news on tech, the research I published, the blogs I wrote, and the eventual (ok, not so eventual) cat posts \u2014 these would be a good enough reason to stay.\nI moved again. The more I moved, the more I met people from everywhere and I can\u2019t lie. It\u2019s nice to have people like your posts from all places in the world, from a multitude of countries and continents. Yet I don\u2019t know half of my \u2018friends\u2019 that are now friends of friends of friends. Some people do not have the luxury to cut off from Facebook. And for some people, Facebook is the internet. For a long time that guilt kept me from quitting on the platform. Stay on and engage, because you can. But recently thought more and more about the other platforms I\u2019m sharing on: Twitter, Instagram, my website. Do I really need Facebook?\nThe one good thing about my Facebook news feed is that it is not an echo-chamber. Yet this truth cannot be put to use in a productive way. The platform is not made to have those interactions. I log on and my newsfeed is a mess. I\u2019ve snoozed x person for the ninth time. I see a sexist post from someone I can\u2019t unfriend. I guess I can snooze them too. I then snooze most accounts because I just want a news feed that is less noise, and more balanced in content. But that news feed is just a dream. And where are the rest of the 500 friends I have on there? Their posts never show up.\nThe increasing number of greyed out profiles increase indicating more people leaving. There is almost zero control of what you see and how you see it. The ads run rampant and so does your connection with them as I\u2019ve noticed via the Ad History option and also when I downloaded my Facebook data.\nI\u2019m well aware that I am already dedicating my words and photos to other Facebook run (and owned) platforms \u2014 Whatsapp, Instagram. I am over giving the company my content on Facebook the platform as well. I really tried to make the platform work for me, but in the end I couldn\u2019t. I really am over it.\n", "link": "https://medium.com/@anabmap/third-times-a-charm-29fce6645d20", "author": "Ana Brandusescu", "comments": [], "claps": "17 claps"}, {"num_comments": 9, "title": "San Francisco\u2019s IPO Panic Is All Hype \u2013 The Bold Italic", "tags": ["tech", "san francisco", "this just in", "real estate", "finance"], "reading_time": 12, "text": "San Francisco is about to be overrun by thousands upon thousands of newly minted millionaires. They will run up and down the streets with money cascading out of their pockets as they giddily embark on post-IPO buying benders. They will snatch up houses in all cash. Buy luxury boats. Throw lavish parties, adorned with elaborate ice sculptures and full of A-list celebrities. Generally, this will be the moment that finally makes it impossible for you to live here.\nAt least, that\u2019s what you would you think if you\u2019ve read media coverage of this year\u2019s expected IPO rush in Silicon Valley. The panic generally started with an ever-dramatic headline in the NYT a few weeks ago: \u201cThousands of New Millionaires Are about to Eat San Francisco Alive\u201d (apparently later changed to be only slightly less intense). The piece blazed its way through our Twitter and Facebook feeds, leaving those of us not poised to strike it rich from an IPO in the coming months distraught over what we were now convinced would be the tipping point that causes the already horrific cost of living here to go over the brink of insanity.\n\u201cHere comes the big one!\u201d the NYT shouted at us with an exclamation point.\nTo summarize for those who managed to avoid the article, and the general consensus in the press, it argues that because a slew of popular tech companies like Uber, Lyft, Airbnb, Slack, and Pinterest will likely go public this year, SF will soon drown in a sea of ultra-wealthy who will cause a ruckus in every part of our lives. \u201cSeemingly the whole city \u2014 and not just the financial planners and the real estate agents and the protesters who block tech buses \u2014 is scrambling to prepare,\u201d it reads.\nOdd, I thought, since it wasn\u2019t actually clear people were preparing or panicking for the so-called \u201cwave of new millionaires\u201d before the article. What is clear: they definitely started to do so after it ran.\nTo put it lightly, since that piece was published, people have been freaking out. The frenzy even caused an emergency SF Board of Supervisors meeting. Realtors I spoke with told me buyers started calling them stressing out about whether they should hurry up and buy before they\u2019re ready just to beat this new rush of rich kids. Sellers, too, rethought their plans \u2014 those once ready to put their home on their market are now reconsidering holding off with promises of getting more money later.\n\u201cI\u2019ve received calls from clients who are extremely anxious \u2014 I\u2019m not kidding, they are really stressed out after reading the article,\u201d said local realtor Eileen Bermingham. \u201cIt\u2019s this looming new source of stress and fear. There is an unnecessary hysteria happening.\u201d\nI mean, I definitely get it. Living here is rough enough as it is. Imagining even more hoards of new millionaires treating SF\u2019s housing market like a candy (or Apple?) store is not a pretty picture. But I couldn\u2019t help but think there was a lot missing from the story.\nSo I decided to look into it. I started out by contacting Robert Chislett, founder of Chisel-it (clever), an ice sculpting business in the Bay Area. In one of the more intriguing parts of the NYT article, he was referred to in the story as \u201cthe IPO ice sculptor,\u201d and quoted as saying he\u2019s \u201cgetting ready to staff up for what he says will be a long year\u201d and \u201cit\u2019s going to be a lot of 14-hour days,\u201d seemingly in preparation for the IPO rush.\nTwitter found the ice sculptor tidbit one of the best parts of the piece. As did I. So, I decided to pay Chislett a visit to his Concord warehouse, a small industrial space filled with massive ice blocks stacked throughout.\nSounds like you\u2019re going to be busy with these IPOs, I said to him. He laughed, looking a bit uncomfortable. I quickly learned the piece (and its reaction) left him really confused.\nSure, he told me, he has worked with many tech companies, but that\u2019s just one segment of his business \u2014 and he wasn\u2019t referring to the IPO rush when he said he was gearing up for a busy time. He\u2019s been planning on expanding his business and warehouse this year anyway, unrelated to anything in tech. In fact, he\u2019s unsure he\u2019s ever done an ice sculpture for an IPO party.\n\u201cI\u2019ve been contacted by a bunch of media outlets, even from the Netherlands, since that story ran,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s been odd and pretty crazy.\u201d\nHuh, a lot of drama, without much substance. How much of the rest of this is storyline is the same?\nTurns out that a lot of people are throwing a side-eye toward all of this hype. I\u2019ve spent the past few weeks talking to people in tech, real estate and finance who largely agree: it\u2019s possible SF could see some impact from the IPOs, but it\u2019s also very possible that it won\u2019t.\nLet\u2019s all take a breath and look at some facts.\nThe fact that a lot of big-name tech companies are planning to go public soon is, of course, true. Lyft was the first of the highly anticipated IPOs to happen last week \u2014 and it went a bit wildly. Shares were priced at $72 and opened at $87.24, but then quickly seemed to crash, falling more than 20 percent below $72 during the first few days before picking up again. Overall, it\u2019s been bumpy, and forecasters think it will continue to be.\nWhile Lyft\u2019s IPO hasn\u2019t been the complete disaster that Snap\u2019s was, it also hasn\u2019t been a raging success or a super-smooth ride. There was a lot of enthusiastic buildup going into the ride-sharing app\u2019s debut in the public market, despite it being an incredibly unprofitable company, having lost $911 million in 2018 (33 percent more than it did two years earlier), and many experts don\u2019t expect it to be profitable for many more years.\nBetting high on a deep-in-the-red company like Lyft is in line with what\u2019s been happening on Wall Street during recent years as investors bet on unprofitable companies\u2019 chances of being profitable like Facebook. While Lyft is seeming to fare OK so far, whether other expected IPOs \u2014like Uber, Slack, Pinterest, Airbnb, and Zoom \u2014 will hold up to their valuations (many in the tens of billions of dollars) is yet to be seen.\nOne thing is clear, though: not everyone will come out on top.\n\u201cThe reality is just because these companies have changed or will change our lives doesn\u2019t mean they will result in strong profits and strong returns,\u201d said Dan Suzuki of Richard Bernstein Advisors. \u201cYou have to worry when everyone bets on loss-making companies being massively profitable winners.\u201d\nSuzuki said there are some similarities between today\u2019s hype and what existed back in 2000 when the tech bubble burst \u2014 a time of overinvestment and overconfidence, when valuations were way too high.\n\u201cIt\u2019s somewhat similar in this cycle, though not quite as extreme \u2014 I foresee more disappointment than a burst, unless you see euphoria take hold,\u201d he said.\nFrom an outside perspective, it makes sense to look at the slew of large tech companies set to go public, estimated to employ more than 30,000 people \u2014 approximately, Uber (16,000), Airbnb (3,000), Lyft (5,000), Slack (2,000), Palantir (2,000), Pinterest (1,600) and Postmates (1,000) \u2014 and figure that there\u2019s going to be a lot more rich people pricing the rest of us out of real estate (like we can afford it anyway). But it\u2019s actually not that clear cut, according to Lise Buyer, the founder of Class V Group, which advises companies ahead of their public offerings.\nHow an employee fares after an IPO is based on a lot of factors, including how long they\u2019ve worked there. Most tech employees have been in their jobs for an average of two years, but it usually takes about four years to really stand to benefit. \u201cJust because individuals work there and have been granted stock options doesn\u2019t actually mean they own those shares fully, are vested or can sell them yet,\u201d said Buyer.\nEven those who have been there long enough to get a big windfall can\u2019t do anything with their stocks during the \u201clockup period\u201d after an IPO, which usually lasts for six months. Then, when they can sell, there\u2019s the issue of tax. Restricted stock units (RSUs), which is what most employees have, are taxed like cash bonuses, typically around 40 percent, in addition to being slapped with California\u2019s high capital-gains tax rate of up to 13.3 percent.\nThere\u2019s also the fact that most employees won\u2019t sell all their stock right away.\n\u201cPeople who sold right away after Facebook\u2019s IPO for half the value are regretting it \u2014 those who held on until after it rebounded fared much better,\u201d said Buyer. If the recent volatility of Lyft\u2019s stock is any indication, that desire to hold on for some time is likely to be a theme during this round of IPOs overall. \u201cThere\u2019s a trend toward slow and steady growth instead of a giant windfall for IPOs these days,\u201d she added.\nAll this means that a small percentage of employees will actually become the characters in the NYT piece, but the media so far has erred on the liberal side, estimating as many as 6,000 new millionaires. But they\u2019ve also admitted that number is pre-tax and could be much, much smaller. Given that California already has about 1 million millionaires, a couple of thousand more (in a good scenario) wouldn\u2019t make much of a dent.\n\u201cGenerally speaking, every company has a small circle at the top that has been there since the early days and stands the best chance of being the very, very big winners,\u201d said Buyer. \u201cBut most people at a company won\u2019t be nipping at Bill Gates\u2019s heels.\u201d\nThe actual number of millionaires, post-tax, is one thing to consider \u2014 then there\u2019s how many will have enough money left over to be able (and want to) buy a home in SF.\nThe assumption is, of course, that new tech IPOs will result in an overwhelming demand for real estate and drive prices up \u2014 new momentum promised for a city that has seen home prices cooling off over the past year. The current line from a lot of realtors: buy now or be priced out forever. But what if the industry is overestimating the demand and underestimating the increase in housing supply that will take place in SF? That\u2019s exactly what Sam Dogen, founder of Financial Samurai, is afraid of.\nWhile the IPOs could have some amount of impact on raising prices, they also very well couldn\u2019t\u2014in fact, there\u2019s a plausible scenario where real estate keeps cooling off, Dogen warned.\nGiven that the median home price is about $1.5 million in San Francisco and that most employees have been at their company for less than two years, are under 35 and make less than $200,000 annually, they probably don\u2019t already have a 20 percent downpayment saved up. So in order to purchase a home in or above the median price range and still have a healthy budget for other expenses and be able to pay taxes, he estimates that they would have to sell at least $2 million in options.\nOf those who could pull that off, he suspects that only a small percentage will want to. Then, there\u2019s the issue of spending that much money to buy instead of rent or move elsewhere to make their money go further. After all, millennials, as everyone loves to point out, love spending their cash on experiences more than things. And many are wising up to whether SF is really the best place in which to invest in real estate.\nAside from the issue of demand, there\u2019s the issue of supply.\nThe SF Bay Area real estate market has been dipping since mid-2018. Part of the reason: the inventory of homes for sale has been consistently growing and is now at a seven-year high \u2014 a fact that\u2019s often overlooked. Why such a surge? Dogen credits that to many factors, including an aging population, increased congestion and general unaffordability. \u201cThere is a demographic shift away from SF to lower-cost places,\u201d he said.\nDogen thinks that supply number will only grow as more sellers try to cash in over the next two years. A lot of homeowners, he believes, are sitting pretty but are waiting for the right time to sell, having chosen to hold off in 2017 and even 2018 as the real estate market became weaker. Many are now thinking that 2019 and 2020 are the ideal times to sell, when, they are being told, an IPO surge will lift prices back to an all-time high.\nBut what happens when they all try to sell within the same time frame in an underwhelming market? The greater surge of supply could potentially even outweigh demand, resulting in a decrease in prices instead of an increase when the IPO rush is said and done.\n\u201cThere\u2019s a good chance the tech-IPO hoopla will awaken a slumbering bear of homeowners in the SF Bay Area who flood the market with new supply,\u201d Dogen writes in his piece \u201cHow New Tech IPOs Could Cause SF Bay Area Real Estate Prices to Fall Further.\u201d \u201cBut things could get even worse given how slowly it usually takes for homeowners to read headlines, contact an agent and prepare their home for sale. The Johnny-come-latelies would create even more supply past the new equilibrium, thoroughly overwhelming demand.\u201d\nThat is, of course, just one scenario. But it is a plausible scenario.\nNearly everyone I spoke to worried about the overconfidence in this year\u2019s IPO rush and its consequences, whether that means people betting too much on stocks, deciding to buy a home before they\u2019re financially ready, deciding not to sell when they should or something else.\n\u201cIt\u2019s been 10 years of boom, so we have a group of 35-and-under people who have never experienced a bust \u2014 there\u2019s a feeling that they can\u2019t lose,\u201d said Dogen. \u201cI worry people are getting caught up in the mania, in a sexy headline being shared around, so they are acting in ways that will put them at financial risk.\u201d\nAnd those aren\u2019t the only effects. One particularly compelling part of the NYT piece mentions a meeting of housing-rights activists in the Mission district, quoting Sarah \u201cFred\u201d Sherburn-Zimmer, the executive director of the Housing Rights Committee of San Francisco, as saying, \u201cIt\u2019s going to mean mass displacement,\u201d about \u201cthe coming wealth influx.\u201d\nBut Sherburn-Zimmer says that quote wasn\u2019t the full picture of what she was saying\u2014it didn\u2019t include the context of real estate speculation. The IPOs may or may not wildly impact housing prices, she said, but the hype around them certainly will. Speculators use things like IPOs and take advantage of industry booms to drive up prices or drive out long-term tenants. Representatives should be doing more to protect tenants from these threats on an ongoing basis, she says.\n\u201cIt\u2019s a cycle: they create speculation, which gets reported on, which feeds the fire, which causes landlords to start saying they can get twice as much money to pressure tenants out,\u201d she said. \u201cNo matter whether this wave ends up being big or small, average folks lose.\u201d\nIn a sense, that\u2019s what it comes down to. What we\u2019re seeing is a self-fulfilling prophecy not just in the NYT but across media, real estate and the tech sectors: creating hype without giving thought to other, less dramatic scenarios based on facts, or what the very real impact of that in and of itself may be on our city.\nSan Francisco has a lot of very real issues now. People are struggling now. That\u2019s not to say that unaffordability might not get worse. It very well might. Thinking and planning for the future is one thing; wasting energy by panicking about a doomsday scenario is another. Let\u2019s focus on creating a city that can better withstand tech\u2019s ebbs and flows. One we can and want to live in now.\n", "link": "https://thebolditalic.com/san-franciscos-ipo-panic-is-all-hype-4f02e8272c08", "author": "Clara Hogan", "comments": ["Thanks for this.

We are a full-service property management brokerage that provides cash-flow certainty to rental property owners. Traditionally, property managers (NPS 8) overpromise on rent to sign owners, creating months of vacancy and lost income for owners.

But there was something unreal about her \u2014 literally. Xin Xiaomeng is a digital composite, one created with the help of machine learning to mimic the facial expressions and speech-patterns of a real-life news anchor.\nXin Xiaomeng is part of the growing ranks of artificial newsreaders on Xinhua, all of them flawlessly delivering whatever is fed to them, without tiring, without slipping up, and without protesting. For a country that already keeps its journalists on a tight leash, this is an unnerving development, especially when you consider that Xin Xiaomeng is modeled on an actual Xinhua journalist named Qu Meng. Automated journalism looks like one more way for the government in Beijing to control of the distribution of information.\nFor now, Xin Xiaomeng\u2019s words are written by a human, and the system\u2019s intelligence is limited to converting text to speech. To really understand how A.I. is changing the news, you need to look at how it is working behind the scenes.\nIn January this year, the Guardian published an article on Australian political donations with the byline \u201cReporterMate.\u201d ReporterMate is, in the words of the Guardian, an \u201cexperimental automated news reporting system\u201d that can analyze a given data set and spit out a simple piece of writing in response. The system\u2019s designer, Nick Evershed, argues that \u201cnews organizations have fewer staff but still need to cover a large amount of news,\u201d and that an A.I. reporter could help with rote stories, freeing time for humans to work on meaningful investigations.\nNewspaper newsroom employees dropped by 45% in the United States from 2008 to 2017, according to a survey by Pew Research. The start of this year saw more than 2,000 job losses across a host of digital outlets, including BuzzFeed and Vice. Seen against this loss of journalists, a robot reporter looks like an attractive tool, capable of pulling data together into routine reports while the remaining humans deploy their skills on more complex stories.\nBut the appeal of A.I. isn\u2019t only in filling the gaps left by job losses. Using A.I., \u201cwe have been able to produce stories that we probably wouldn\u2019t have done otherwise,\u201d says Jeremy Gilbert, director of strategic initiatives at the Washington Post. For the past few years, the Post has also been experimenting with automation, centered on a piece of in-house technology called Heliograf. During the 2016 Rio Olympics, Heliograf generated hundreds of short reports on the games. During the 2016 U.S. elections, it was used to help cover close to 500 races.\nInstead of picking a few bellwether political races to cover, Heliograf allows a news organization to report, to some degree, on all of them. When Associated Press (AP) similarly started using A.I. to generate financial stories in 2014, the number of its corporate earnings reports increased tenfold, so much so that it actually affected trading volumes in financial markets. Using a different system, AP will soon begin generating previews of all 1,250 NHL regular-season games. Crucially, it isn\u2019t just that a machine is doing something a human reporter would have normally done, but that it is capable of doing more than a human could do \u2014 at least measured by raw quantity.\nThings get complicated when you consider how to serve that machine-generated sprawl to an audience. Instead of flooding its front page with hundreds of articles about political races, the Washington Post geolocated users during the 2018 midterms as a way of offering them relevant pieces. If you were in Pennsylvania, for example, the website would suggest A.I.-generated reports on your local races.\n\u201cThe idea is that instead of writing one to many, you\u2019re writing one-to-one across many, and that\u2019s critical,\u201d Gilbert says. \u201cIdeally, from my perspective, we want to get to a place where, with information you are willing to share, we can give you stories you might be interested in that other people wouldn\u2019t be.\u201d\nReg Chua, chief operating officer of editorial at Reuters, shares a similar vision. \u201cWe\u2019ve built news around the notion that we write something and we publish it to as many people as possible,\u201d he tells me. \u201cThat\u2019s very much a model of broadcasting to everyone at the same time and needing a story that appeals to as many people as possible.\u201d\nInstead, Chua asks, what if a news organization\u2019s coverage was so all-encompassing that this model could be upended? \u201cIf I want to write a story about U.K. schools and how they\u2019re doing, what a reader really wants to know is how their child\u2019s school is doing,\u201d Chua says. \u201cCould I write that piece using a combination of A.I. and automation, so that you essentially have a one-to-one story?\u201d\nSports scores, political results, house prices, school performance reports: These might be pretty harmless areas for an A.I. to cook up hundreds of micro-reports and dish them out to the \u201cright\u201d readers. But could personalization go too far, reinforcing our existing interests and opinions rather than the traditional journalistic role of introducing the reader to important new information selected by experienced editors?\n\u201cThere is a danger that, even within a single publication, tweaking what people see in reflection of their own personal interests and preferences creates an echo chamber effect,\u201d warns Josh Cowls, a research associate in data ethics at the Alan Turing Institute, the U.K.\u2019s national institute for data science and artificial intelligence. There\u2019s a comparison to be made to YouTube, Cowls says, which has faced strong criticism for pushing people to increasingly extreme content through its recommendation engine. \u201cYou may reinforce what people think. Your news preferences could come to code what you see, which means you may end up going down an ever-narrowing corridor of choice.\u201d\nIn addition to complicating which articles are shown to whom, A.I. systems could also play an increasing role in deciding what information is shown within individual stories. The Washington Post\u2019s Gilbert says one area of interest for him has been looking at how machine intelligence could be used to change the architecture of articles themselves, depending on what was known about the reader.\nHe gives the example of a story about the ongoing civil dispute in Venezuela. \u201cFor some people, all we need to say is \u2018what did Maduro do?\u2019 or \u2018did the aid trucks make it across the border?\u2019\u201d Gilbert says. \u201cThat new information is important to them because they\u2019ve been following the story. On the other hand, if they\u2019ve not paid any attention to the story, then we need to tell them who\u2019s involved, why it\u2019s an issue, how long it\u2019s been going on.\u201d\nThink about an online article less like a static print news story and more like a piece of origami, with sections folded and unfolded depending on who happens to be reading. In this case, the A.I. becomes an editor, reshaping paragraphs to fit different pairs of eyes. \u201cIt absolutely changes the relationship between a reporter, an editor, and news and their audience,\u201d Gilbert says.\nBut does it change that relationship for the better? At what point does this A.I. personalization cross the line from being helpful to the reader\u2019s time to being unwieldy, even obfuscating? \u201cIt certainly raises ethical questions, because the input data going into the system relates as much to the audience as the news itself,\u201d Cowls says. \u201cYou get into legal questions about personal information. Ethically, there are questions of identity and preference.\u201d\nFor an algorithm to determine which version of a story to show a reader, it would need to make a call on how much that person already knows about a topic. That could be based on reading history, but there would be a legal question about how this data gathering squares with laws such as the General Data Protection Regulation in Europe, which has strict rules on how companies use personal information. More generally, how far should a newspaper go in painting a picture of a person\u2019s knowledge about the world? It might be one thing to proactively ask readers about the content areas that interest them, with the intent of steering similar stories toward them, something many media brands \u2014 including Medium \u2014 already do. It might be something else entirely for a brand to use machine learning to passively absorb a reader\u2019s interests, possibly without the reader even knowing. Similar concerns about the manipulation of information and civil discourse have led social media companies into difficult territory.\nLucas Graves, a senior research fellow at the Reuters Institute for the Study of Journalism, agrees that changing the content of articles depending on who is reading them \u201creally challenges traditional newsroom ethics.\u201d Editors today use their professional judgment to decide what information to include where, so it would be radical for newsrooms to hand that authority to computers.\nArguably the most meaningful potential impact of machine learning is not on the audience-facing side of journalism, but rather in digging out stories for human journalists to work on.\nReuters has developed a number of A.I. newsgathering systems, including News Tracer, which is designed to unearth breaking stories by scanning Twitter with algorithms that search for clusters of tweets discussing the same event. It gauges the trustworthiness of the information based on a number of factors, including whether a Twitter account is verified, who its followers are, whether there is attached media, and the structure of the tweet itself.\nAnother Reuters project, Lynx Insights, searches big data sets like stocks or sports scores, flagging trends and anomalies and even penning a few sentences before handing it over to a human journalist. Instead of a robot reporter, Lynx Insights is more like a journalist\u2019s personal data scientist. It\u2019s a similar approach to the one that BuzzFeed took when it trained an algorithm to sift through flight data to recognize spy planes, or when ProPublica used machine learning to study thousands of press releases to analyze what Congress talks about.\n\u201cProbably the most useful thing A.I. can do is analyze data,\u201d says Chua of Reuters. \u201cAnd you can see how in the future you could start marrying these things together. You analyze the data through an A.I. system automatically, and then that turns it into a story automatically.\u201d\nIt seems inevitable that these automated processes will eventually become connected. A system like Reuters\u2019 Lynx Insights could automatically find a potential story, feed this information to a version of the Guardian\u2019s ReporterMate to write, and then pass that story to an artificial newsreader like Xin Xiaomeng to read on live TV \u2014 the whole process completed without a single human in the loop.\n\u201cThe more we mechanize this stuff, the more we might start to think, \u2018Hang on, what is the added value?\u2019\u201d Cowls says. \u201cAnd what is the added value of editorial at all if all we\u2019re trying to do is collect facts and spread them out? It\u2019s a dangerous path to go on... [Y]ou may end up in a situation where the integrity of not only a publication at large but also the story is devalued by this process.\u201d\nThis dystopian level of news automation is, hopefully, unlikely. Both Chua and Gilbert admit we are in the early stages of exploring how A.I. fits with journalism, and the technology is not yet sophisticated enough to stray beyond the most contained of data sets. \u201cReporters will still be needed for a while yet,\u201d writes the Guardian\u2019s Evershed.\nBut even if we\u2019re not talking about artificial anchors reading automated news, we need to tread carefully. Given that the information these systems produce is wrapped in the implied credibility of a news story format, it is vital to keep tabs on what goes into machine-made reporting, whether that\u2019s the background data, the words themselves, or who gets to see those words. The readers, after all, are only human.\n", "link": "https://onezero.medium.com/the-dawn-of-the-cyborg-journalist-2ed57e653087", "author": "Thomas McMullan", "comments": [], "claps": "740 claps"}, {"num_comments": 44, "title": "Mistakes, we\u2019ve drawn a few \u2013 The Economist", "tags": ["data visualization", "data journalism", "data", "journalism", "charts"], "reading_time": 8, "text": "At The Economist, we take data visualisation seriously. Every week we publish around 40 charts across print, the website and our apps. With every single one, we try our best to visualise the numbers accurately and in a way that best supports the story. But sometimes we get it wrong. We can do better in future if we learn from our mistakes \u2014 and other people may be able to learn from them, too.\nAfter a deep dive into our archive, I found several instructive examples. I grouped our crimes against data visualisation into three categories: charts that are (1) misleading, (2) confusing and (3) failing to make a point. For each, I suggest an improved version that requires a similar amount of space \u2014 an important consideration when drawing charts to be published in print.\n(A short disclaimer: Most of the \u201coriginal\u201d charts were published before our chart redesign. The improved charts are drawn to fit our new specs. The data are the same.)\nLet\u2019s start with the worst of crimes in data visualisation: presenting data in a misleading way. We never do this on purpose! But it does happen every now and then. Let\u2019s look at the three examples from our archive.\nThis chart shows the average number of Facebook likes on posts by pages of the political left. The point of this chart was to show the disparity between Mr Corbyn\u2019s posts and others.\nThe original chart not only downplays the number of Mr Corbyn\u2019s likes but also exaggerates those on other posts. In the redesigned version, we show Mr Corbyn\u2019s bar in its entirety. All other bars remain visible. (Avid followers of this blog will have seen another example of this bad practice.)\nAnother odd thing is the choice of colour. In an attempt to emulate Labour\u2019s colour scheme, we used three shades of orange/red to distinguish between Jeremy Corbyn, other MPs and parties/groups. We don\u2019t explain this. While the logic behind the colours might be obvious to a lot of readers, it perhaps makes little sense for those less familiar with British politics.\nDownload chart data\nThe chart above accompanied a story on the decline of dog weights. On first glance, it appears that the weight and neck sizes of dogs are perfectly correlated. But is this true? Only to some extent.\nIn the original chart, both scales decrease by three units (from 21 to 18 on the left; from 45 to 42 on the right). In percentage terms, the left scale decreases by 14% while the right goes down by 7%. In the redesigned chart, I retained the double scale but adjusted their ranges to reflect a comparable proportional change.\nConsidering the jolly topic of this chart, this mistake may seem relatively minor. The message of the chart, after all, is the same in both versions. But the takeaway is important: if two series follow each other too closely, it is probably a good idea to have a closer look at the scales.\nDownload chart data\nWe published this polling chart in Espresso, our daily news app. It shows attitudes to the outcome of the EU referendum, plotted as a line chart. Looking at the data, it appears as if respondents had a rather erratic view of the referendum result \u2014 increasing and decreasing by a couple of percentage points from one week to the next.\nInstead of plotting the individual polls with a smoothed curve to show the trend, we connected the actual values of each individual poll. This happened, primarily, because our in-house charting tool does not plot smoothed lines. Until fairly recently, we were less comfortable with statistical software (like R) that allows more sophisticated visualisations. Today, all of us are able to plot a polling chart like the redesigned one above.\nAnother thing to note in this chart is the way in which the scale was broken. The original chart spreads the data wider than it should. In the redesigned version, I have left some more space between the start of the scale and the smallest data point. Francis Gagnon has put together a nice formula for this: aim for leaving at least 33% of the plot area free under a line chart that doesn\u2019t start at zero.\nDownload chart data\nNot quite as criminal as a misleading chart, charts that are difficult to read are a sign of a visualisation job done badly.\nAt The Economist, we\u2019re encouraged to produce \u201cmind-stretching\u201d journalism. But, sometimes, we take this too far. The chart above shows the United States\u2019 trade deficit in goods and the number of people employed in manufacturing.\nThe chart is incredibly difficult to read. It has two main problems. First, the values of one data series (trade deficit) are entirely negative, while the others (manufacturing employment) are all positive. It is challenging to combine such disparities in one chart without flattening either data series. The apparent \u201csolution\u201d to this leads to the second problem: the two data series don\u2019t share a common baseline. The baseline of the trade deficit is at the top of the chart (highlighted by a red line drawn across half of the chart body). The baseline of the right scale is at the bottom.\nThe redesigned chart shows that there wasn\u2019t any need to combine the two data series. The relationship between the trade deficit and manufacturing employment remains clear and only takes a minimal amount of extra space.\nDownload chart data\nThis chart compares government spending on pension benefits with the share of people aged 65+ for a selection of countries, with a particular focus on Brazil. To keep the chart small, the visualiser only labelled a selection of countries and highlighted those in electric blue. The OECD average is highlighted in pale blue.\nThe visualiser (me!) ignored the fact that a change of colour often implies a categorical change. On first glance, this seems to be the case in this chart too \u2014 all electric blue colours seem to belong to a different grouping to the dark blue ones. This is not the case. The only thing they have in common is that there were chosen to be labelled.\nIn the redesigned version, the colour of the circles remains the same for all countries. I have changed the opacity of those that aren\u2019t labelled to make the others stand out. Typography does the rest: Brazil, the focus country, is written in bold text, and the OECD average in italics.\nDownload chart data\nThe mistakes in this final category are less obvious. Charts like these are not misleading, nor are they very confusing. They merely fail to justify their existence \u2014 often because they have been visualised incorrectly or because we tried to cram too much in too little space.\nWhat a rainbow! We published this chart in a column on Germany\u2019s budget surplus. It shows the budget balances and current-account balances for ten euro-area countries. With so many colours \u2014 some of which are quite difficult to distinguish or even see because the values are so small \u2014 the chart\u2019s message is impossible to make out. It almost tempts you to glaze over and move on. And, more importantly, since we are not plotting all euro-area countries it doesn\u2019t make any sense to stack the data.\nI revisited the story to see if there was a way to simplify this chart a little. The column mentions Germany, Greece, the Netherlands, Spain and the euro-area total. In the redesigned version of the chart, I decided to only highlight those. To resolve the problem of stacking only a selection of countries, I added another category (\u201cOthers\u201d) that includes all other euro-area countries. (The total current-account balance in the redesigned chart is lower than in the original chart. This is because of a data revision from Eurostat.)\nDownload chart data\nConfined by the limited space on a page, we are often tempted to force all the data we have into a slot that\u2019s way too small. Although this saves valuable space on the page, it has consequences \u2014 as shown in this chart, from March 2017. The story is about how scientific publishing is dominated by men. All data points are equally interesting and relevant to the story. But by presenting such a lot of data \u2014 four research-field categories as well as the share of inventors \u2014 the information is hard to take in.\nAfter giving it quite a lot of thought, I decided not to redesign this chart. If I were to keep all the data, the chart would have become way too big to go with a concise story. In cases like this, it would be better to cut something. Alternatively, we could show some sort of average measure, e.g. the average share of publications by women across all fields. (Please let me know if you have any ideas on how to visualise this in a tight space! I\u2019d love to hear your ideas.)\nDownload chart data\nBest practices in data visualisation are evolving fast: what may be acceptable today can be frowned upon tomorrow. New and better techniques are emerging all the time. Have you ever committed a chart crime that could have been fixed easily?

You get the idea.\nHere\u2019s the truth:\nMy reaction will be words, lots of them, and annoying. I\u2019ll be seriously annoying.\nAnd as to the title of this article, well... just kidding. How would I know if you\u2019re harboring more pathogens than a dog? You might be a filthy animal. Though to be fair, our dog did roll in shit a couple days ago. (She got a bath shortly after.)\nBut I digress. Let\u2019s break down what happened.\nThe study itself is of limited value by scientific standards.\nOn top of this, many of the reports based on that study both 1) ignore the limited utility and 2) sensationalize the wrong points from that study and subsequent interviews.\nIf you have a beard and someone important in your life is now freaked out about said beard, send them a link to this article.\nConsider it a public service to call out questionable science, and to save innocent beards.\nThe other day I was killing a few minutes on Reddit and a story popped up in several subreddits, including r/science and r/beards.\nIt was about how men\u2019s beards carry more germs, and potentially harmful/infectious germs, than dogs do.\nI decide to give this a read since it\u2019s relevant; I have both a big beard and two dogs. Plus, I love a good science article.\nThis particular article was complete bullshit, as were the majority of those I\u2019ve found since. They all read something like this:\nSure, this sounds like science reporting. It includes words like \u201cstudy,\u201d \u201cSwitzerland,\u201d \u201cresearchers,\u201d and they give NUMBERS! I mean, who doesn\u2019t love numbers?\nAnd we all know that everything you read on the internet is true, right?!\nBut in those two sentences alone, I had already identified that the report was utter garbage, and the study was \u201cmeh\u201d at best.\nI\u2019ve since looked at several other reports on the same study (or on other reports).\nThe overwhelming majority are complete and total crap, published specifically to capitalize (in clicks) on a now-viral (no pun intended) piece of five-cent reporting.\nWhen I say these reports were crap, I mean the kind you\u2019ll find on my dog\u2019s neck after she rolls in something dead.\nHere\u2019s the straight dope:\n(Prepare yourself to be wowed by statistical analysis and general nerdology. Are you ready? Let\u2019s do this!)\nBefore we dig in, I will admit I didn\u2019t read the study in its entirety because I\u2019m not going to pay $39.95 to read something I can immediately tell is of severely limited value.\nBut from the abstract, reports, and/or interviews, here is what you can take away:\n1. n1=18 (men); n2=30 (dogs)\nThis is an incredibly small sample size, too small to really produce meaningful results. In fact, it\u2019s barely better than anecdotal.\n2. There is no mention of any habits, specific hygiene practices, general lifestyles, beard types or styles, etc. One report mentioned that the researchers \u201cnoted the length\u201d of the beards \u2014 um, okay?\n3. The researcher(s) made comments that allowed/enabled some of this widespread crap reporting.\n\u201cDogs can be considered cleaner than beards\u201d is only fair in the extremely limited context that the study provides. And, the reports don\u2019t sufficiently convey that context.\nTo give the researchers credit, they did a lot of things right.\nNext, let\u2019s take a look at what went wrong with the media reporting. The issues are many and various.\nPause with me, and channel your inner George Takei as we say, \u201cOh, myyyyyy!\u201d\nLet\u2019s dig in.\nLet\u2019s start with Daily Mail since they were early in reporting.\nSadly, a ton of other outlets then reported based largely on that BS report, specifically citing it:\n\u201c...The Daily Mail reports...\u201d\nReally? If you\u2019re going to steal someone else\u2019s reporting, steal something good, FFS.\n\u201cMen with beards carry more germs than DOGS with deadly bacteria in their facial hair, study reveals\u201d\nFirst, the word \u201cdogs\u201d is capitalized, suggesting that it is a high bar against which beards were compared.\nDo a study comparing beards to cat paws, and then let\u2019s talk.\nSecond, the headline says \u201cwith deadly bacteria\u201d, and then includes no mention of what type of bacteria in the article itself.\nNothing I can find in the study abstract or any other report anywhere suggests that the bacteria are deadly. Only one even mentioned a general class or category of bacteria, stating they are associated with urinary tract infections.\nDeadly? Do tell.\nThird, they say the study \u201creveals\u201d this info. This is quintessential sensational bullshit, suggesting that this information was hidden.\nThe writers at the Daily Mail even go so far as to gaslight, saying that critics of the study and article \u201cclaim the results stem from pogonophobia\u201d (fear of beards).\nThey don\u2019t mention the limitations of the study, at least not as such.\nAnd they omit a key point of the study\u2019s methods and results. The study was specifically looking for \u201ccolony-forming units (CFU) of human-pathogenic microorganisms...\u201d\nTotal shocker. </sarcasm>\nAnd even THAT particular result did not reach statistical significance. In other words, \u201cwe\u2019re pretty sure that people have more people-harming bacteria than dogs do... but maybe not.\u201d Seriously. This is straight from the study abstract.\nI\u2019ll skip the rest of the specific issues, and move on to a brief exercise in skepticism, which many or most media outlets could really use.\nHere are a list of questions to get the thinking skeptic aware of some of the limitations of the study:\n1) Where are all these men from? Where do they live? What kind of residence do they inhabit?\n2) What are their grooming routines?\n3) How is their general hygiene? Specifically, how is their oral hygiene?\n4) Are they sexually active? Specifically, do they regularly engage in oral sex?\n5) How many of the men had children who live at home?\n6) How much food mass was found in their beards?\n7) Was it cold or flu season when this study was performed?\n8) What kinds of bacterial counts were found on the faces of clean-shaven men? And women? On other parts of those same bearded men?\n9) Which kinds of bacteria were found in these men\u2019s beards, and are these otherwise uncommon in/on adult humans?\n10) Why were only 18 men\u2019s beards sampled? And why only 30 dogs?\n11) In fact, why bearded men? Since the study sought to determine whether or not dogs are a concern for transmission of zoonotic diseases when sharing MRI equipment with humans, why was such a narrow human focus chosen for comparison?\n12) What was the standard against which \u201charmful to humans\u201d was measured?\n13) How often, and how recently, were the dogs bathed?\n14) Were they indoor or outdoor dogs?\nI could go on. Trust me. (Just ask my partner... who has been getting an earful since she sent me the link.)\nHere\u2019s the list (so far) of media outlets which specifically cited The Daily Mail\u2019s report online:\nUSA Today specifically mentioned limitations of the study, and got the takeaway exactly right.\nInteresting Engineering mentioned limitations of the study, as any decent engineering/science outlet should.\nAnd props to RT.com for coming out with direct criticism!\nWhile there are a number of takeaways that can be gained from this onslaught of sensationalist reporting, here are the key ones to remember:\nFirst, The Daily Mail (dot com) isn\u2019t worth the paper it\u2019s printed on. (See what I did there?)\nRelated, if the report/article cites Daily Mail, close the tab. Don\u2019t revisit.\nIf the report says the takeaway is \u201cmen should shampoo their beards more,\u201d or \u201ctell your man to shave,\u201d close the tab. Don\u2019t revisit.\nIf the report cites the only \u201ccontroversy\u201d or opposition as a quote from Keith Flett, founder of the Beard Liberation Front, close the tab. Don\u2019t revisit. (No disrespect to Keith.)\nAre you starting to see a pattern here?\nThe ONE takeaway you should have after reading either the study abstract itself, or a decent report on it, is that if dogs are scanned on an MRI machine which is also for human use, the dogs likely pose no threat to the humans.\nThat\u2019s it. That\u2019s the whole schmear. And even that conclusion is weak because of the small sample size and aforementioned limitations of the study.\nThe other big takeaway you should have after reading this post \u2014 or the slew of terrible reports on the study \u2014 is that we all need to think critically.\nBecause you know the majority of \u201cnews media\u201d won\u2019t do it for you.\nIt\u2019s pretty simple, really.\nBeard on! Because beards are awesome.\nAnd if someone starts in with \u201coh, I just found out that beards harbor all sorts of deadly...,\u201d reenact the \u201cZip it!\u201d scene from Austin Powers 3.\nAnd most important... send them a link to this post.\nLike this article, and want to grow a better, bigger, more badass beard?

As the nattering nabobs of online commentary remind me every day over at Philly.com, where I am the national opinion columnist, I can write columns and give speeches like this one \u2014 criticizing the president, even calling for his removal from office \u2014 without worrying about getting arrested and thrown in jail. That\u2019s a good thing \u2014 but should we really set the bar for press freedom that low?\nThe reality is that the Trump era is the most perilous time to be a journalist in my lifetime and probably in American history. The leader of this country has proclaimed journalists \u2014 citizens like me and probably your neighbors, regular folks who see their job as simply keeping your community or your nation informed \u2014 as \u201cthe enemies of the people,\u201d a phrase with grim historical echoes dating back to Joseph Stalin. At mass rallies of cheering acolytes, Trump points to a fenced-in pen of journalists as zoo-like objects of derision. The U.S. government has stopped mostly holding briefings for the press and when it does give out information, it frequently lies; Trump himself has been documented telling more than 9,000 falsehoods in just 27 months as president. Reporters must do their jobs in an unprecedented climate of fear. In Annapolis, Maryland, a man with a grievance and a gun walked into a newsroom and slaughtered 5 people. Others are bullied or harassed \u2014 online or in real life. I\u2019ve seen it personally. For the first time in nearly 40 years as a journalist, I\u2019ve had to call police because a death threat was mailed to my home.\nThe world is noticing. In 2018, our nation \u2014 founded as beacon of democracy and constitutionally protected civil rights \u2014 was ranked a weak 45th in the world for press freedom by the group Reporters Without Border, behind a diverse group of nations such as Romania, Chile and Namibia. (Update: The new 2019 report dropped the U.S. to 48th.) Reporters Without Borders specifically faulted Trump as a \u201cmedia-bashing enthusiast...The U.S.\u2019 decline in press freedom is not simply bad news for journalists working inside the country; the downward trend has drastic consequences at the international level,\u201d the report noted. \u201c \u2018Fake news\u2019 is now a trademark excuse for media repression, in both democratic and authoritarian regimes.\u201d\nIf you\u2019re interested enough in the state of journalism in America to come to a speech like this, then you probably know a lot of what I just told you. But the battle for news professionals to be able to do their job in an open society where they feel their rights are protected, and where they are respected and not harassed is only half of the story \u2014 and arguably even not the most important half. The battle for press freedom is taking place within a much wider war for the truth.\nIn July 2018, President Trump addressed the national convention of the Veterans of Foreign Wars in Missouri. \u201cStick with us,\u201d he told the gathering. \u201cDon\u2019t believe the crap you see from these people, the fake news. ... What you\u2019re seeing and what you\u2019re reading is not what\u2019s happening.\u201d He was referring to a slew of negative headlines \u2014 but he could have been offering a mantra for his entire presidency. Trump was simply doing what any aspiring autocrat might do. The goal is not merely bending the truth, but obliterating the very notion of objective reality. According to various fact checkers like the Washington Post, the president has lied to the American people at least 9,000 times since taking office. I\u2019d give you an exact number but it\u2019s probably changed since I started this speech.\nWhen the president and his minions lied in his very first weekend \u2014 about the size of the crowd at his inauguration, no less \u2014 it was a big deal. But somewhere between lie No. 6000 and lie No. 7000 \u2014 OK, I\u2019m guesstimating \u2014 folks were just too numbed and exhausted to care. Which actually is the whole point \u2014 to overwhelm the public is past the point of caring. As for journalism, this is the point where reporting the news stops to matter, because half the nation has been convinced that the news is fake and the other half is too depressed to get out of bed.\nWorking as a journalist in America wasn\u2019t supposed to be like this. The great writer Joan Didion once said, \u201cWe tell ourselves stories in order to live.\u201d When I was a teenager in the 1970s \u2014 the formative years for so many of the late-stage baby boomers who now run America\u2019s newsrooms \u2014 the story that we told ourselves in order to live was Watergate.\nActually, let me take a step even further back, to the decade that continues to fascinate me and the rest of us who are roughly my age and who watched it pressed against the windows of a yellow, grade-school bus, the 1960s. Young people who were just a tad older than us were idealistic \u2014 raised in the shadow of post-World War II American triumphalism \u2014 and believed they could expose and fight the hypocrisy they\u2019d seen in Vietnam and the segregated South and change the world. But by 1973, after Kent State and Richard Nixon\u2019s landslide over anti-war candidate George McGovern, changing the world through protest and politics seemed hopelessly naive.\nWatergate changed everything. President Richard Nixon and his obsession with quashing youthful protests was brought down not by masses flooding the streets, but with a slow, relentless quest for the truth by professionals. This happened in many places \u2014 a judge\u2019s chambers, a congressional hearing room \u2014 but no place more dramatically than the newsroom of the Washington Post.\nWhen the film \u201cAll the President\u2019s Men\u201d \u2014 dramatizing the Watergate reporting of Bob Woodward and Carl Bernstein \u2014 came out in 1976, the last wave of baby boomers who wanted to change the world were told the absolute best and coolest way to do that was to become a news person. Applications to journalism school soared, and with newspapers still the only way to get in-depth news, there were still many decent jobs to be had.\nMake no mistake, this generation of media pros \u2014 my generation \u2014 has produced some remarkable, difference-making journalism. But over time, journalists of the post-Watergate world didn\u2019t change the world so much as the world changed us. And that happened for a couple of different reasons.\nFor one thing, the upheavals of the 1960s and \u201970s had inspired a brand of journalism that was more inclined than ever to root out corruption, expose the nexus of big money and politics, and fight for the oppressed in America society. To essentially question authority. You didn\u2019t think authority was going to take that lying down, did you?\nFrom the time of Richard Nixon and his vice president Spiro Agnew \u2014 who famously attacked the mainstream media as \u201cnattering nabobs of negativism\u201d \u2014 conservatives intent on sustaining that status quo saw that their path toward retaining power and influence depended on both delegitimizing the mainstream media and creating an alternative network to promulgate their own worldview. Agnew was the point man on the first mission, rallying the GOP base in 1970 against \u201cimpudent snobs\u201d in the Establishment media.\nOn another front, a young Nixon aide named Roger Ailes imagined a politically right-wing TV news network that he\u2019d bring to fruition a quarter-century later, as the Fox News Channel. A conservative attorney named Lewis Powell \u2014 who in a matter of months would be named by Nixon to the Supreme Court \u2014 drafted the infamous Powell Memo for business leaders, envisioning an array of new media and think tanks that would protect capitalism from the rampaging hippies. Powell\u2019s dream really took off in the 1980s during the presidency of Ronald Reagan, who killed the FCC\u2019s equal time rules, thus allowing Rush Limbaugh and a thousand other right-wing radio shows to bloom. It was a marriage made in heaven \u2014 a ready-made audience of middle-class citizens riled up over the culture wars launched in the \u201960s and the disappearance of their jobs, wedded to business elites and their political allies riding the crest of what they\u2019d stirred up, and laughing all the way to the bank.\nAnd so you\u2019re probably wondering \u2014 what happened to all those earnest young journalism school graduates, stoked on caffeine and their tattered copies of \u201cAll the President\u2019s Men\u201d? The sequel is never as good as the original. The story of Watergate, remember, was that journalists with a nose for unearthing facts saved democracy. But over time \u2014 and maybe partly in response to the withering critique from the likes of Agnew, Powell and Ailes \u2014 the lesson got garbled. By the end of the last millennium, journalists grew more obsessed with the \u201cwe\u2019re unearthing facts\u201d part of that story line than the \u201csaving democracy\u201d part.\nJournalism by the 1990s became something of a religion, if not a cult, with strange rituals. Its gods were called Objectivity and Balance. Journalists were expected to be dispassionate about the society they chronicled; a few prominent editors believed it was impure to even vote. On contentious issues, it became gospel that every story must have two sides. On one hand, on the other hand. By the dawn of our 21st Century, there was a boxing match for the truth between a right-wing movement that was armed with brass knuckles and a mainstream media with one tattered glove tied behind its back.\nObjective journalism sounds like a lovely idea \u2014 who is against fairness, after all? \u2014 but how it was practiced in this bloody arena presented a couple of problems. For one thing, the new universe of conservative storytellers created in the wake of the Powell memo found that some of industry\u2019s exploitive, billion-dollar profits could be spent on creating a bogus \u201con the other hand\u201d that didn\u2019t actually exist in nature. When climate change threatened America\u2019s fossil-fuel oligarchy, oil companies simply created a new infrastructure of think-tanks and paid-for experts \u2014 demanding \u201cbalance\u201d in mainstream venues like the New York Times while making climate denial the default position on right-wing talk radio and Fox News.\nMeanwhile, investigative reporting during these years turned away from the massive abuses of power that had been exposed in Watergate and toward what you could call \u201cthe objective scandal\u201d \u2014 acts of hypocrisy that could be proved without any blurred lines, with a binary \u201cyes\u201d or \u201cno.\u201d The kind of late-night sleuthing that brought down Richard Nixon over the shredding of the Constitution in 1974 was now turned against Democratic presidential candidate Gary Hart in 1987 to prove he was cheating on his wife. (Would a philandering Gary Hart still have been a good president of a bad one? I guess we\u2019ll never know!)\nNot surprisingly, the media\u2019s weakness in investigating high level abuses of power meant that the powers that be felt carte blanche to... abuse power. In 2002 and 2003, when the George W. Bush administration seized on the public\u2019s post 9/11 fears and desires for revenge to foment a war against a country that had nothing to do with the 2001 attacks, journalism was blindsided. All the sources it traditionally looked to in order to provide any \u201con the other hand\u201d against the case for war with Iraq \u2014 congressional Democrats, for example \u2014 were cowed into silence.\nIt was around this time that a Bush aide \u2014 widely reported as top political advisor, Karl Rove (who issued a denial years later) \u2014 told the writer Ron Suskind that journalists like him were part of a \u201creality-based world\u201d that was being left in the dust. \u2018We\u2019re an empire now, and when we act, we create our own reality,\u201d Suskind was told. \u201cAnd while you\u2019re studying that reality \u2014 judiciously, as you will \u2014 we\u2019ll act again, creating other new realities, which you can study too, and that\u2019s how things will sort out. We\u2019re history\u2019s actors...and you, all of you, will be left to just study what we do.\u201d\nThere was just one problem with Team Bush\u2019s assessment. The mad spin doctors had lost control of their diabolical experiment. By the time that Bush\u2019s aide uttered those words in the mid-2000s, the internet had been a fixture in the life of everyday Americans for roughly a decade. And over the next couple of years, the invention of Facebook, YouTube and Twitter created both a world where mainstream reporters using journalistic news judgment no longer controlled the flow of information, and where networks of hundreds of millions of people were ready to share and spread their own information \u2014 or misinformation \u2014 in a matter of nanoseconds.\nThe rise of talk radio and the Fox News Channel had been ripe for control by the manipulative elites of the Republican Party and Big Business. But this new frontier of creating \u201cother new realities\u201d was ripe for a demagogue. And then Donald Trump descended from an escalator in Trump Tower on June 16, 2015.\nSuddenly, a half-century of resentments whipped up by the Agnews and Limbaughs of the world had a leader who knew no boundaries in channeling that anger to suit his own egotistical purposes. And yet it\u2019s striking the degree that graduates of the nation\u2019s best political science and journalism programs still don\u2019t get what just happened. They continue to ask how millions of working-class whites can vote against their interests, for a president who\u2019d take away their health care and pollute their streams. They don\u2019t understand how the burning flame of resentment against the elites who they feel look down on them so easily trumps \u2014 pun intended \u2014 whether you can afford to see a doctor or breathe the air in your hometown.\nIn December 2016, or about six weeks after Trump was elected the 45th president of the United States, I traveled to Hershey, Pennsylvania, for his victory rally in the large hockey arena there. About 8,000 people attended, and I got there early on a frigid day to talk to some of them. It was striking how few wanted to discuss \u201cissues\u201d like jobs, even though central Pennsylvania has been plagued by chronic unemployment and under-employment. Instead, everyone wanted to talk about their loathing of the media, including \u2014 for a few of them, anyway \u2014 me. For them, it mattered little if Trump ever followed up on his promise to replace Obamacare with \u201csomething really great.\u201d Their hopes and dreams were plastered on signs and shouted in an occasional chant that had just two words: \u201cCNN sucks.\u201d The medium truly had become the message.\nBut if resentment and even outright hatred of the media is a driving force of the Trump presidency, how does this play out in actual governing? Many have argued that the president\u2019s talk about actual retribution against journalists is little more than just talk \u2014 that there\u2019s no policy component. As a candidate in 2016 and since his election, Trump has frequently said that he wants to \u201copen up\u201d libel laws which would make it easier for public figures \u2014 such as himself \u2014 to sue journalists for unflattering stories. But this still hasn\u2019t resulted in actual legislation, nor is such a bill likely now that Democrats control the House of Representatives.\nLikewise, the White House has made various threats against journalists or news organizations that for now seem to be mostly threats. Trump has asked the Post Office, for example, to raise the rates it charges to giant retailer Amazon, which happens to be led by Jeff Bezos, who also happens to own the Washington Post, which happens to be highly critical of the Trump administration. But it\u2019s unclear where the rate hikes affecting Amazon are dramatically worse than the higher rates that all postal customers are always paying.\nBefore Trump fired Jim Comey in 2017, he met with the FBI director and both men made gross jokes and laughed about ending news leaks by throwing a journalist or two in jail. In the aftermath of the Barr Letter claiming that the Mueller Report offers the president some measure of exoneration on whether his campaign colluded with Russian election interference, Trump\u2019s reelection campaign took the alarming step of asking networks to stop booking certain officials who\u2019d make allegations of such collusion. But these officials still keep popping up on my TV screen. So is the fact that the legal framework for a free press still exists, and that \u2014 unlike many of those countries ranked much lower than No. 45 for press freedom \u2014 reporters aren\u2019t being tossed in jail or routinely murdered a cause for celebration?\nYes and no, but mainly no.\nFor one thing, the Trump administration is successfully demolishing the idea that our government should be accessible and available to the people. Full-blown presidential press conferences are rare, and briefings by the White House press secretary Sarah Sanders have devolved from an every-weekday occurrence to an average of little more than one every month. Even worse, this attitude has filtered down toward essential agencies like the State Department and the Pentagon, which hasn\u2019t had a press briefing in \u2014 and I swear I\u2019m not making this up \u2014 more than 300 days. I mean, it\u2019s lot like the Defense Department and its annual $750 billion budget does anything important, right?\nOther impacts of Trump\u2019s war on the press are both intangible yet very real. One is the increasing climate of fear in which journalists must do our jobs. Much of this I know anecdotally \u2014 the stories I hear from friends and colleagues about the constant online harassment, the threatening emails, and occasionally worse. This was punctuated by tragedy in the summer of 2018, when a deranged reader with a longstanding grievance walked into the newsroom of the Capital Gazette in Annapolis, Maryland, and fatally gunned down five journalists. In the aftermath of that tragedy and in this awful new climate, my own newspaper, the Philadelphia Inquirer and Daily News, was forced to invest in an elaborate new security set-up just to enter our newsroom. Stop and think about that. Money that could have been spent on hiring more reporters to hold government accountable is instead spent to keep reporters from getting killed.\nAnd yet too many newsroom leaders are pretending isn\u2019t happening \u2014 that the war on objective reality that was amped up by Karl Rove and Dick Cheney, and that all our current president\u2019s men now seem determined to finish off, doesn\u2019t even exist. At the end of Trump\u2019s first year in office, then-Arizona Senator Jeff Flake \u2014 a Republican, from the president\u2019s own party \u2014 rose up to declare: \u201c2017 was a year which saw the truth \u2014 objective, empirical, evidence-based truth \u2014 more battered and abused than any other in the history of our country, at the hands of the most powerful figure in our government. It was a year which saw the White House enshrine \u2018alternative facts\u2019 into the American lexicon, as justification for what used to be known simply as good old-fashioned falsehoods.\u201d\nTwo years later, things have only gotten worse. Several thousand lies later, a demonstrably provable falsehood uttered by the president of the United States on a public stage is no longer a news story. Spin doctors like Kellyanne Conway are still invited on national TV to offer \u201calternative facts.\u201d All of it geared toward the same end \u2014 so that the president\u2019s hardcore base of 65 million people who only get their news from Fox or right-wing internet websites can nod their heads to their leader\u2019s mantra: That \u201cwhat you\u2019re seeing and what you\u2019re reading is not what\u2019s happening.\u201d\nThe question posed by this unprecedented assault on the American free press is: How does journalism fight back. At least, that should be the question, but often it comes out more like: Will journalism fight back? There\u2019s too many in my profession who continue to call for a quaint return to civility \u2014 to pretend that none of what I\u2019ve just described is happening in the United States right now.\nOne of the more dumbfounding moments for me as a journalist in the last 27 months came when the White House Correspondents Association freaked out not over the group\u2019s chronic abuse from Team Trump but over a humorous takedown of the president at its annual dinner by the comedian Michelle Wolf. The head of the journalists\u2019 association wrote that the dinner is supposed to be \u201ca unifying message about our common commitment to a vigorous and free press while honoring civility...\u201d This sounded like a hostage note, disguised as an apologia.\nOther critics have a more clear-eyed view of the threat to press freedom, and have been engaged in a long-running dialogue about how best to respond. One of these has been my longtime friend Jay Rosen, the journalism professor at New York University. Jay has a knack for turning a phrase, and one of his rallying cries is \u201csend the interns.\u201d What that means is that the spin exercises like those increasingly rare White House press briefings should be covered by the most junior reporters with a tape recorder \u2014 freeing up the most skilled and experienced journalists for investigative. This feels right to me, but it also feels like one step in a much longer journey.\nThe problem is that too many journalists \u2014 including some of the biggest names in the business \u2014 think the only real response to Trump is to bury our heads and keep doing our jobs, to simply work even harder and somehow produce better stories. This strikes me like responding to a strange foreign land by continuing to speak English, but a lot louder. The epigraph for this attitude was uttered by Marty Baron of the Washington Post, the journalist who were better or worse will be remembered as Liev Schreiber in the movie \u201cSpotlight.\u201d Asked how the Post is responding to Trump, Baron said: \u201cWe\u2019re not at war... We\u2019re at work.\u201d\nI could not disagree more. True, we\u2019re not in a declared war with Donald Trump \u2014 that would be both counter-productive and on some level antithetical to the fundamental practice of journalism. But we are in a war for the truth, for objective reality \u2014 and if we don\u2019t grab our weapons and start fighting back we\u2019re about to get flattened by a blitzkrieg of tanks. Another wise thing that Jay Rosen wrote recently is this:\n\u201cIf you do your job, then you\u2019re playing the role of hate object and participating in Trump\u2019s political style. If you don\u2019t want to be a hate object, sorry \u2014 then you cannot do your job. Detachment loses its meaning in this system, which incorporates journalists whether they like it or not.\u201d The real question is not whether we\u2019re in a war, but who\u2019s going to win?\nThe problem with mainstream journalism in the Trump era is the broader problem of journalism in the post-Watergate era generally: Too much focus on the process, of checking off the boxes of objectivity and balance and making sure that every one hand has an other hand, even when those five digits in the other hand are clutching a dagger. Meanwhile, there\u2019s much less thought about the end result \u2014 about what journalism is actually for. We need to rediscover the soul buried deep inside of the keyboard of that objectivity machine. And that begins, I believe, with the simple acknowledgement that a free press has an agenda: A functional democracy.\nSo when democracy is under attack \u2014 as it is in the Trump era \u2014 then saving journalism and saving democracy become the same job. The issue isn\u2019t that the media needs to be relentlessly anti-Trump. The issue is that the media needs to fight relentlessly for the fundamental human principles that Trump has so consistently aligned his government against.\nYou can\u2019t have democracy \u2014 or a free press \u2014 unless every citizen has the right to vote. In an era of shrinking voting rights and out-and-out ballot-box suppression, newsrooms need to ask themselves \u2014 what am I doing to expose and get rid of the laws that make it harder for a citizen to cast her or his ballot? Have we enlisted our resources not only to help our readers register to vote and get to their polling place, but to help them make informed choices when they get there?\nYou can\u2019t have democracy \u2014 or a free press \u2014 when the human rights of people inside our borders are under assault, whether those people are the refugees who show up at our southern border seeking the freedom of asylum and not a concentration camp masquerading as a tent city, or whether it\u2019s the black and brown kids who want to want down their own streets without being stopped and frisked and occasionally shot by cops who act like an army of occupation. It\u2019s not simply a matter of how do we expose these wrongs, but how do we use our power as a news organization to help America reconnect with its humanity.\nYou can\u2019t have democracy \u2014 or a free press \u2014 without a planet. And we\u2019re not going to have much of a planet in a few decades unless we help our readers to have faith in science. That means no more \u201con one hand, on the other hand\u201d when it comes to climate change and the consensus of the world\u2019s leading climatologists. It means giving our readers the truth, making that truth so engaging that they\u2019ll pay attention \u2014 and tossing the oil-soaked money changers out of the temple.\nAnd here\u2019s one more thing. You can\u2019t have a democracy \u2014 or a free press \u2014 without...a free press. Rather than hide behind the 1st Amendment and pray that no one notices us while we\u2019re at work and not as war, we need to be much louder about proclaiming who we are, the role we play in every city and town across America, and the ways that this function that the Founding Fathers understood was so important for a functioning republic is now under assault.\nYes, this is about fending off the president\u2019s attacks, but it\u2019s about so much more. The disappearance of local news in the 21st Century has now been studied by academics and they\u2019ve found that towns without journalists as watchdogs see voter participation drop and spending on bond issues or other measures of waste or corruption increase. Most news orgs won\u2019t survive unless they win back local dollars, but that won\u2019t happen unless we win back hearts and minds.\nBut readers won\u2019t fight for us unless we fight for ourselves! Remember what I said earlier about why so many young people decided forty years ago to become journalists in the first place \u2014 because they thought it was the best way to change the world for the better. It would be easy to look back now, knowing everything that has happened since 1974 \u2014 the beginnings of Facebook and Twitter and the looming end of newspapers, the culture wars and the political wars and the rise of authoritarianism here and elsewhere \u2014 and laugh at that idea as hopelessly nai\u0308ve.\nBut it wasn\u2019t. It was the right and moral idea then, and it\u2019s the right and moral idea now. Every journalist should wake up in the morning and ask herself or himself, am I working on something that will make my town, my state and my country a better place to live? And how am I using my talents \u2014 my ability to ferret out facts, track down the right officials or the right documents, to analyze, interpret and write \u2014 to get us there. That doesn\u2019t mean ditching certain basic tenets \u2014 fairness, listening to differing sides on an issue, or a willingness to accept truth, even when it\u2019s uncomfortable. But it also doesn\u2019t mean treating journalism like an ossified religion where the daily rituals of access to the powerful outweighs the spiritual quest for the very soul of what we do.\nI have enormous optimism for the future. Over the last couple of years, I\u2019ve been blessed to have spent a couple of semesters working with college journalists at a campus very much like this one, over at nearby Temple University. Those students have restored my faith \u2014 in journalism and in humanity, which to me are pretty much the same thing. They came from such diverse communities \u2014 the children immigrants from places like the Philippines or the Dominican Republic, or they were the bedrock of Philadelphia\u2019s historically black neighborhoods. They weren\u2019t afraid of either the dismal business prospects for journalism or the bullying from a government and its goons calling them \u201cenemies of the people.\u201d They want to tell the stories of their families, their communities, and the other Americans who look like them. Like every generation \u2014 the hippies of the \u201960s and the geeks of the \u201970s and all those who came before them \u2014 they see the pen and the keyboard and the iPhone as their tools for making America and the world better. In the Trump era, those tools are also weapons of a conflict \u2014 a war for the truth. And I believe that we will win.\n", "link": "https://medium.com/@willbunch/saving-journalisms-soul-in-the-age-of-trump-3286d9acc31f", "author": "Will Bunch", "comments": ["I\u2019m much more optimistic after reading this article.

It was an opportunistic shot. Schmitt was untethered, floating upside down in space with a handheld camera.\nThe image he captured is the first full image of our planet.

There is no more powerful representation of cosmopolitanism, the idea of being a citizen of the world above all else.\nThe word \u201ccosmopolitan\u201d and the very idea it represents comes from ancient Greece. Kosmopolite\u0302s: \u201ckosmo\u201d meaning \u201ccosmos\u201d or \u201cworld\u201d, and polite\u0302s meaning \u201ccitizen\u201d.\nThe word was coined by Diogenes of Sinope, an extraordinary philosopher born around 423 BCE. When somebody asked him where he was from, he replied that he was \u201ca citizen of the world\u201d.\nHe was among the first of the \u201cCynic\u201d school, a movement of philosophers that followed the ethical lessons of Socrates.\nThe Cynics were not cynical in today\u2019s sense of the word. They diligently pursued the idea of virtue as living in accordance with nature. This meant embracing poverty since the pursuit of riches was deemed to be unwise.\nThe word \u201ccynic\u201d came from the Greek word for \u201cdog\u201d \u2014 kynicos. Diogenes had a shocking disdain for social conventions, so people likened him to a stray dog. He was eccentric by any standard, living in a wine tub dumped outside the walls of a temple, he was frequently naked in public, and relieved himself in the street.\nDiogenes seemed to embrace the comparison with dogs. He thought that humans would do well to learn from the dog\u2019s shamelessness. Dogs live fully in the present, free of the self-imposed anxieties that people inflict on themselves. Dogs don\u2019t care about abstract concerns such as reputation, self-dignity, wealth or national pride.\nThe philosopher\u2019s ideas and exacting reason defied any attempt to write him off as insane. He used irony and humour to drive his ideas home. He would walk around at midday holding a lit torch, telling people he was searching for an honest man.\nHe mocked Plato during the classes of the Academy. When Plato defined a man as a \u201cfeatherless biped\u201d, Diogenes arrived at his school holding a plucked chicken, exclaiming, \u201cBehold! I\u2019ve brought you a man.\u201d\nDiogenes\u2019s reputation spread far and wide. So famous was the philosopher that Alexander the Great, the leader of a vast empire of which Athens was part, paid him a visit in the city of Corinth in 336 BCE when he was the Prince of Macedon.\nStanding at the opening of Diogenes\u2019s tub, Alexander asked him if he wanted anything at all since the enormously rich prince could probably grant his wish. Diogenes replied, \u201cyes, stand out of my light.\u201d\nThe prince took the quip well and was so struck by the wisdom of the philosopher that he said, \u201cIf I were not Alexander, I wish I were Diogenes.\u201d To which Diogenes replied, \u201cIf I wasn\u2019t Diogenes, I would be wishing to be Diogenes too.\u201d The story is apocryphal but gives a good idea of Diogenes\u2019s outlook.\nLittle of Diogenes\u2019s thought has survived, we only have anecdotal evidence of his body of knowledge. The philosopher is believed to have written as many as ten books and several plays. Cynicism, however, is a largely demonstrative philosophy \u2014 it\u2019s how it is lived that is important. What we know of the sage\u2019s actions are sufficient to have a good idea of his beliefs.\nDiogenes inspired a rich man named Crates to give up everything he had to be a Cynic philosopher. Crates became the mentor to Zeno of Citium, the founder of the Stoic School. Stoicism, a system of thinking that would flourish over the next millennia, counting among its adherents slaves (Epictetus) and emperors (Marcus Aurelius), is ultimately a branch of Cynicism.\nFor the Cynics, wisdom is found when we abandon the artifices of man. Diogenes is thought to have said, \u201cHumans have complicated every simple gift of the gods.\u201d\nProperty rights, nationality, politics, reputation and decency were scorned as irrational. To be rational was to live in accordance with nature, and nature has no need for such artificial concepts that only stoke our irrational desires.\nContentment, according to Diogenes, can be found in self-sufficiency, austerity and shamelessness.\nOf what is known of Diogenes\u2019s ideas, cosmopolitanism is the most powerful. It would have been an extraordinarily radical and even dangerous idea to hold at the time.\nGreek city-states and the Macedonian Empire in which they were subsumed were fiercely competitive and demanded the total loyalty of their citizens.\nHierocles, the Stoic philosopher following Diogenes, conceived of the self as dwelling within concentric circles of belonging, the first being family, then extended family, then townspeople, then countrymen, then humanity.\nThe task of those who want to be wise, according to Hierocles, was to draw those circles to the centre, so that we may regard the rest of humanity with the same affection with which we regard our immediate family.\nThe cosmopolitan ideal has a powerful effect on people. Once the spell of belonging or loyalty is lifted, other attachments fall like dominos. When we consider the world our home, all the trappings of materialism and our allegiances seem shallow and petty.\nWhile most of us wouldn\u2019t want to follow Diogenes into a dog-like existence, his ideas give us some release from what weighs us down. We can attach ourselves to things for the sake of pragmatism, but we are not trapped by obedience to those things.\nMany have embraced cosmopolitanism since, not so much for practical reasons, but for the transcendence it enables us. James Joyce wrote in his semi-autobiographical novel, A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man,\nThis transcendence gives us a refreshing perspective on some of the most pressing problems we face. The world as a whole is our environment and we are interdependent when we are faced with its destruction.\nWhen we see the world alone as our home, we understand that we as humans are one. From there we\u2019ll regard others with mutual respect, even if we disagree with them.\nAll nations crumble in time. No matter how tight you pack the sand, your castle will be lost to the beach the following day. National pride, allegiances and loyalties to geographies or groups offer no better future to humanity.\nOf course, many nations practice good values like freedom, equality and democracy. We are tempted to argue that national pride is important if we are to propagate those values to other unfree, unequal, and undemocratic nations. But it would do us better to swear allegiance to those perfect values than to our nations that realise them imperfectly.\nBesides, while great values endure, nations slowly die.\nHow many men swear their vehement loyalty to Roman Empire now? It was once the greatest empire the world has known, and now tourists stand on the dust of its remains.\nWhat of mighty Carthage, of Assyria, of the Aztecs? Or the great Babylonians? In all these societies people no doubt believed things would remain the same. Most believed their societies to be the best, to be the freest, the home of the bravest and smartest.\nThe same will happen to the United States, to China, to the United Kingdom, to France and to Russia. All these empires will wash away in the tide of history.\nDiogenes\u2019s request to Alexander to get out of his light could be read figuratively as well as literally. Alexander represents nationhood, empire and power; Diogenes represents pure humanity, stripped of all the trappings of authority and obedience.\nIf we are to survive as a species, at this time of existential threat from global warming and weapons of mass destruction, perhaps it\u2019s time to give Diogenes the light of adulation that we\u2019d normally reserve for emperors.\nThank you for reading.\nIf you enjoyed this article, you may like my article on Seneca and Time:\n", "link": "https://medium.com/personal-growth/diogenes-and-cosmopolitanism-1310e849712a", "author": "Steven Gambardella", "comments": ["Diogenes\u2019 rejoinder to Alexander is a nice approach to how to deal with condescending celebrities\u00a0.Great essay on a fascinating thinker!!", "Thanks Patrick!"], "claps": "348 claps"}, {"num_comments": 14, "title": "My plan for public lands \u2013 Team Warren \u2013 Medium", "tags": ["environment", "2020", "public lands", "climate change", "elizabeth warren"], "reading_time": 7, "text": "By Elizabeth Warren\nBruce and I love to hike. We\u2019ve been all over, from Bryce Canyon in Utah to Alaska to the Cape Cod National Seashore in our backyard. America\u2019s public lands are one of our greatest treasures. They provide us with clean air and water, sustain our fish and wildlife, and offer a place where millions of Americans go every year to experience the beauty of our natural environment. At 25% of America\u2019s total land, they are also an irreplaceable resource.\nBut today, those lands are under threat. The Trump administration is busy selling off our public lands to the oil, gas and coal industries for pennies on the dollar \u2014 expanding fossil fuel extraction that destroys pristine sites across the country while pouring an accelerant on our climate crisis.\nIt doesn\u2019t have to be this way. We must not allow corporations to pillage our public lands and leave taxpayers to clean up the mess. All of us \u2014 local communities and tribes, hunters and anglers, ranchers and weekend backpackers \u2014 must work together to manage and protect our shared heritage. That\u2019s why today I\u2019m rolling out my plan to protect our public lands and preserve wild, natural places for future generations.\nMaking our public lands part of the climate solution \u2014 not the problem.\nAny serious effort to address climate change must include public lands \u2014 fossil fuel extraction in these areas is responsible for nearly a quarter of all U.S. greenhouse gas emissions. The Trump administration, with its casual denial of science and apparent amnesia about massive crises like the BP oil spill, has also proposed opening nearly the entire U.S. coastline to seismic testing and offshore drilling.\nIt is wrong to prioritize corporate profits over the health and safety of our local communities. That\u2019s why on my first day as president, I will sign an executive order that says no more drilling \u2014 a total moratorium on all new fossil fuel leases, including for drilling offshore and on public lands. I\u2019d also reinstate the methane pollution rule to limit existing oil and gas projects from releasing harmful gases that poison our air, and reinstitute the clean water rule to protect our lakes, rivers, and streams, and the drinking water they provide.\nAnd it\u2019s not enough to end our public lands\u2019 contribution to climate change. We have an enormous opportunity to make them a part of the climate solution, and for both economic and environmental reasons, we should take it. A decade ago, there were zero major solar power projects on public lands. Today, the Bureau of Land Management has approved 11,000 megawatts of renewable wind, solar, and geothermal projects \u2014 enough to power millions of American homes. It\u2019s a significant proof-of-concept. But to make a real dent in the problem, we\u2019re going to need a whole lot more.\nAs President, I will set a goal of providing 10% of our overall electricity generation from renewable sources offshore or on public lands. That\u2019s nearly ten times what we are currently generating. We can achieve this goal while prioritizing sites with low impact on local ecology but high potential for renewable energy generation. My administration will make it a priority to expedite leases and incentivize development in existing designated areas, and share royalties from renewable generation with states and local communities to help promote economic development and reduce local dependence on fossil fuel revenues.\nKeeping our public lands in public hands, and maintaining and preserving existing lands.\nWith one stroke of his pen, President Trump shrunk our protected lands by more than two million acres in 2017 \u2014 the single biggest rollback of protected lands in U.S. history. His move opens up Bears Ears and Grand Staircase-Escalante national monuments in Utah for mining and drilling, which will cause irreversible damage. These lands are part of our national fabric, sacred to tribes and beloved by American families. As president, I will use my authorities under the Antiquities Act to restore protections to both monuments and any other national monuments targeted by this Administration.\nI\u2019m strongly opposed to the sale or transfer of our national forests, wildlife refuges, and other national public lands. Our public lands should stay public, so that they can be enjoyed by all of us. Congress created a bipartisan program called the Land and Water Conservation Fund for exactly this purpose. But unfortunately, Congress has not kept its promise \u2014 and year after year, money that was intended for conservation is diverted for other purposes. This is a raw deal, and we need to fix it. It\u2019s time to make Land and Water Conservation Fund spending mandatory to ensure that we continue to preserve and enhance public lands for conservation and recreation. That\u2019s the way we honor our commitment to conservation and ensure our children and grandchildren can experience the great outdoors.\nWe also have a responsibility to care for the lands in our possession \u2014 but for too long we haven\u2019t funded our public land management agencies accordingly. Today our national parks alone face a bill of over $11 billion in deferred maintenance. The result? Crumbling roads and bridges, leaking roofs, and unmaintained trails now closed to hikers. It\u2019s not just an embarrassment. It\u2019s also poor stewardship of a hugely valuable economic resource. So let\u2019s fix it. As president, I will fully fund our public land management agencies and eliminate the infrastructure and maintenance backlog on our public lands in my first term.\nMoney alone won\u2019t solve the problem \u2014 it will take hard work. In the 1930s, President Franklin Delano Roosevelt proposed the Civilian Conservation Corps, a public work relief program that put those unemployed during the Great Depression to work maintaining federal lands. We must embrace a modern version of this model, and I was proud to support a recent update to the program to allow for public-private partnerships with existing conservation and service organizations. But given the magnitude of the challenge, now we need to turbocharge it. I will recruit 10,000 young people and veterans to jumpstart a 21st Century Civilian Conservation Corps \u2014 and increase the budget of AmeriCorps\u2019 one-year fellowship program to fund it. This will create job opportunities for thousands of young Americans caring for our natural resources and public lands, deepening their lifelong relationship with the great outdoors.\nCreating universal access to public lands to respect every American\u2019s birthright and to grow the size of our outdoor economy.\nNational parks have been called \u201cAmerica\u2019s best idea\u201d because they embody a democratic ideal: Our most breathtaking places are protected and accessible to all, not just the wealthy or privileged. And while there were more than 318 million visits to our national parks last year, these places are still out of reach for scores of low-income families. There\u2019s no better illustration of how backwards our public lands strategy is than the fact that today, we hand over drilling rights to fossil fuel companies for practically no money at all \u2014 and then turn around and charge families who make the minimum wage more than a day\u2019s pay to access our parks. The National Park Service is funded by taxpayers, and it\u2019s long past time to make entry into our parks free to ensure that visiting our nation\u2019s treasures is within reach for every American family.\nIncreasing access to our national parks and public lands is not just the right thing to do; it will also strengthen our economy. Americans are spending more time outdoors than ever before, and public lands are huge economic engines for local communities, drawing in travel and tourism dollars. Outdoor recreation accounts for $887 billion in consumer spending each year and creates 7.6 million sustainable jobs that can\u2019t be exported overseas. Communities with accessible outdoor recreation opportunities have a competitive economic advantage, but a patchwork of ownership and access rights means that as many as 10 million acres in the West are not accessible to hunters, anglers, and other outdoor enthusiasts. It\u2019s time for us to open more public lands to responsible recreation \u2014 and prioritize accessibility for all Americans to enjoy the great outdoors. I commit to unlocking 50% of these inaccessible acres, to grow our outdoor economy, help ease the burden on our most popular lands, and to provide a financial boost across rural America.\nEnsuring that everyone with a stake has a voice in decisions about the management of our public lands.\nPublic lands in public hands doesn\u2019t mean the federal government should ignore the interests of local stakeholders. Too often, local actors feel cut out of decisions that implicate federal lands adjacent to their communities, whether that\u2019s where to site an energy project or how to better conserve wildlife habitat. In addition, Tribal Nations have deep connections to land now controlled by the federal government, but are often denied access and consultation about its use.\nI believe it is possible to protect our public lands and still respect communities. It\u2019s time for the Department of Interior to meaningfully incorporate the role of state, local, and tribal stakeholders in the management of public lands. The administration of public lands should incorporate tribes\u2019 traditional ecological knowledge, making provisions for tribal culture and customs on public lands, and exploring co-management and the return of resources to indigenous protection wherever possible. And the hard work of balancing economic, recreation, and ecological concerns will be improved by meaningful consultation with all state and local stakeholders as decisions are made about the land.\nAmerica\u2019s public lands belong to all of us. We should start acting like it \u2014 expanding access, ending fossil fuel extraction, leveraging them as part of the climate solution, and preserving and improving them for our children and grandchildren. Together, we can manage and protect our public lands for generations to come.\n", "link": "https://medium.com/@teamwarren/my-plan-for-public-lands-e4be1d88a01c", "author": "Team Warren", "comments": [], "claps": "1.91K claps"}, {"num_comments": 6, "title": "Yes, \u201cPlant-Based Food\u201d Belongs in the Green New Deal", "tags": ["vegan", "food", "culture", "environment", "politics"], "reading_time": 6, "text": "Behind the Curve, the Netflix documentary about the Flat Earth movement, just opened my eyes to a growing movement of people who are convinced the earth is literally flat. So I\u2019m no longer surprised at humanity\u2019s difficulty in coming up with a common path toward saving the planet.\nIf we can\u2019t even agree the earth is spherical, despite scientific consensus, how can we agree on anything?\nWith that in mind, I know regardless of the scientific backing behind what I write, some people are going to believe what they want to believe. Still, I\u2019m going to say it:\nA recent study in the journal Science found cutting meat and dairy products could reduce an individual\u2019s carbon footprint from food by up to 73%.\nPoore, along with researcher Thomas Nemecek, included data on 38,700 farms in 119 countries. They found that, if everyone ate vegan, global farmland use could be reduced by more than 75% \u2014 an area equivalent to the US, China, European Union and Australia combined. Everyone could be fed, and we could have way more wild space.\nFrom the study\u2019s abstract:\nShe recently tweeted:\n\u201cYesterday I visited a school assembly w/ teens in Queens.\nOne of them asked, \u201cWhat can WE do to combat climate change?\u201d\n2 recs:\n\u2014 Skip disposable razors+switch to safety razors\n\u2014 Give your tummy a break! Skip meat/dairy for a meal (easiest is bfast, I do banana & peanut butter)\u201d\n\u2014 AOC on Twitter\nHer Green New Deal mentions the need for a greenhouse gas-free food system, prompting some meat-eating politicians to freak out while eating cheeseburgers:\nDid you catch that: he called burgers an endangered species? There are an estimated 1.5 billion cows alive right now, by the way. They\u2019re constantly being slaughtered, and new ones being bred. However, destroying rainforests for cattle grazing, and to grow huge amount of soybeans to feed cattle, is leading to endangered species and extinction.\nA shocking 60% of all mammals on Earth are now livestock \u2014 mostly cattle and pigs. 36% of mammals are human. That means just 4% of mammals on Earth are neither livestock nor humans. When it comes to birds, 70% of the birds on Earth are farmed poultry. So, no, farmed animals are not endangered.\nOn the premiere of Showtime\u2019s Desus & Mero, AOC said:\nOn one hand, yes, if everyone is flexitarian, it will do more good than if a tiny amount of people are vegan.\nOn the other hand, she just used the word crazy, and she did it for the same reason the children\u2019s books on saving the planet don\u2019t mention meat and dairy: We can\u2019t talk about these things unemotionally, because food is so personal. People are really attached to their meat-eating, so every time we advocate for doing less of it, we wonder if we need to tag on an, \u201cI know it sounds crazy,\u201d for anyone to even listen.\nI work with children and families, and I am constantly aware of the need to keep my vegan views to myself. I would never hold back in telling kids to reuse or recycle, but when it comes to veganism, I am afraid that it might be overstepping to talk about it.\nIf I, a vegan who works with children, am afraid to teach about it, then is anyone telling kids the truth?\nI did a write-up of Earth Day children\u2019s books for the April print issue of Raise Vegan, a magazine focused on vegan parenting. While compiling my list, I was struck by how few children\u2019s books acknowledge the impact our food consumption choices have on the environment. There are plenty of children\u2019s books about being eco, but unless a book is specifically written for and marketed to the vegan community, positive aspects of eschewing (or eating less) meat and dairy aren\u2019t mentioned. The closest I found was The Trouble with Dragons, which hints at it.\nMeanwhile, our town\u2019s recycling, like that of towns across the world, is being dumped in landfills, no matter how carefully we sort.\nAnd planting a tree is great, but not cutting down rainforests in the first place would be much better.\nSure, turn off the lights, but it\u2019s not enough.\nThe environmental crisis is so huge that individual choices aren\u2019t enough. We need systematic change. At the same time, we can push for this change, and we can examine which of our choices make the most difference.\nEating no (or less) meat and dairy \u2014 creating less demand for these products and therefore lessening supply, and therefore altering the entire food system \u2014 would have huge, real benefits, in terms of climate change, resource depletion, mass extinction, and human health. And I believe humans might have an easier time with kindness toward each other, if more of us were living a life where we defined ourselves by our kind choices.\nBut it\u2019s hard to talk about. It\u2019s hard for vegans to tell others about these benefits, because we often sound like we\u2019re bragging. And it\u2019s hard for omnivores to imagine changing their habits, because it might mean turning down grandma\u2019s chicken soup or bringing your own food to a pizza party.\nIf people can\u2019t even say the earth is spherical anymore, in some circles, without sounding like a know-it-all, how will we ever talk about the benefits of veganism and be heard and believed?\nThunberg convinced her family to go vegan too. Thunberg\u2019s example shows us that, rather than our generations teaching the children, the children might have to teach us. Please, let\u2019s join them. They\u2019ve had enough of past generations destroying their planet. Don\u2019t leave them to fix it alone.\nSo, for Earth Day or any day, if you want to do something right now to make a positive difference, consider eating more plants and less meat and dairy.

The first, 48 years ago, was a big deal. It was 1970. We were in the mood to celebrate the earth and to warn against the destruction of our natural places. Now we\u2019re watching again as our supposed caretakers are licking their lips at the thought of all that land open to rape-for-profit.\nThe earth is our only home. We owe it to her\u2013and to ourselves\u2013to keep her healthy. At some point we have to heed the warnings. We\u2019re at the stage now where the earth would be better off without us.\nGaylord Nelson, Democratic senator from Wisconsin, founded Earth Day as both a celebration and a warning. He wrote:\nI remember that first Earth Day, April 22, 1970. The scope of it was astonishing and really surprising. It was a grassroots movement in the best sense of the phrase, and we all felt good about it. (Most of us, that is. The day after, The Daughters of the American Revolution branded the Earth Day commemoration \u201cdistorted\u201d and \u201csubversive\u201d. It didn\u2019t help that the first Earth Day happened to fall on the 100th anniversary of Vladimir Lenin\u2019s birth.)\nWhat Gaylord Nelson originally proposed was a nationwide teach-in on school campuses. He chose April 22 because it would fall after Easter break but before final exams. It was spring. The earth was renewing itself. Environmentalism was gearing up and in motion, and it was a fine time to give the earth a day.\nRichard Nixon was president and, while he didn\u2019t participate in any of the day\u2019s events (maybe because a damned Democrat came up with the idea), he was actively talking about attacks on the environment and the steps the government would need to combat them. Pollution was a big issue already, and steps had been taken to de-smog the cities. It was working. (Nelson had actually talked to JFK in the early 60s about the need to draw attention to the environment, and a day to commemorate had been thrown out there then. Nothing happened.)\nIndustry was king, and the environmentalists, alarmed at water, ground and air pollution levels, were talking to brick walls (when they weren\u2019t batting their heads against them). In 1962, the year Rachel Carson published \u201cSilent Spring\u201d, 750 people died in London\u2019s smog. In 1965, four days of inversion held down a cloud of filthy air that killed 80 people in New York City. In 1969, Cleveland\u2019s Cuyahoga River caught fire. Earlier that year, an oil platform six miles out from Santa Barbara, California, blew out, spilling 200,000 gallons of oil, creating an 800 square mile oil slick that settled on 35 miles of California shoreline. Almost 4,000 birds were killed, along with fish, seals and dolphin.\nEnough had finally become enough, and under Lyndon Johnson and a congress that could see clearly now (even though the rest of us were still lost in a choking, eye-watering, salmon-colored, man-made smog), we saw a Clean Air Act, a Clean Water act, a National Wilderness Preservation System, a Wild and Scenic Rivers Act, a National Trails System Act, and, for what it was worth, a National Environmental Policy.\nThat all changed, of course, when Ronald \u201cA tree is a tree\u201d Reagan became president. For the Department of Interior, he chose James Watt, a notorious anti-environmentalist, to head it. He chose Ann Gorsuch, another determined anti-earthling, to head the Environmental Protection Agency. What a laugh that was\u2013or might have been, if it weren\u2019t so serious. They were chosen for the same cynical reasons George W. Bush chose his department heads\u2013so that regulatory agencies could, from the inside, be forced to stop regulating.\nGale Norton, GWB\u2019s choice for Secretary of Interior was called \u201ceven worse\u201d than James Watt, by the Defenders of Wildlife. I shuddered over that one. I remembered James Watt, and I thought nobody could cause as much havoc on our little section of the earth as that little man did. I thought we had learned something along the way. I thought all those Arbor Days and Earth Days and global warming warnings had taught us all something. Some of us obviously weren\u2019t listening.\nNow, under Donald Trump, we have David Bernhardt, already under investigation for conflicts of interest, who recently took over for Ryan Zinke, called \u201cthe worst Interior Secretary ever\u201d by the Wilderness Organization.\nAnd who\u2019s running the EPA? Andrew Wheeler, a former coal lobbyist.\nSo let\u2019s not look to the helpers there.\nThis Earth Day, 48 years after the first, caught most of us by surprise, coming as it does the Monday after Easter. It\u2019s getting almost no play in the news and on the internet, but wouldn\u2019t it be great to see crowds out there giving it their all \u2014 marching and chanting in solidarity over saving Earth\u2019s last breath?\nWhat I wouldn\u2019t give for a sea of tie-dyes and peace signs and flower garlands...\nThe aroma of Pachouli...\nAll those things I thought were pretty silly back then are looking pretty good to me as I take note of the day we promised to give Earth a chance.\nFor more reading on this day you can\u2019t beat Rachel Carson:\nhttps://www.brainpickings.org/2019/04/12/rachel-carson-scripps-college-commencement/?mc_cid=3378db57d5&mc_eid=cf8e7daa68\n", "link": "https://medium.com/@ramonagrigg/celebrating-earth-day-while-the-patient-is-dying-aac7185b8aff", "author": "Ramona Grigg", "comments": [], "claps": "87 claps"}, {"num_comments": "unspecified", "title": "More Books on Climate Change Won\u2019t Help Us Now \u2013 OneZero", "tags": [], "reading_time": 7, "text": "In 1989, Bill McKibben \u2014 then a journalist who had recently quit a five-year stint at the New Yorker \u2014 published a landmark environmental text called The End of Nature.

Both are mysterious frontiers as yet largely unexplored and with magnificent potential \u2014 from sunken cities and trench inhabitants to strange planets tidally locked to their stars, creating a surface of duality where scorching temperatures coexist beside glacial, shimmering tundras. They\u2019re also immense; looking out across the faceted blue of the waters it seems to be infinite. Grand and indomitable. It\u2019s because of this illusion that we\u2019ve had a terrible effect on the ocean\u2019s ecosystem. We\u2019ve depleted fish populations, killed half the Great Barrier Reef, and continue to add more than 8 million tons of plastic into the ocean each year. We\u2019re treating the space around Earth in much the same way.\nIt\u2019s difficult to believe with such clear night skies \u2014 freckled with luminous bodies of stars and planets \u2014 that anything exists up there which might hinder space exploration. And yet much like the iconic rings around Saturn, there\u2019s a growing ring of debris circling Earth. It\u2019s composed of dead satellites, slivers of paint, fragments of solar panels and rockets from missions long ago. Altogether there are millions of pieces of debris in orbit with only 22,300 of those pieces regularly tracked by the US Military. Theoretical models are needed to predict the path of any debris under 10 cm, which can\u2019t be tracked. And while the military has the largest public database of space debris, even this doesn\u2019t include satellites omitted by international governments, commercial companies, or our own ongoing projects.\nThe most frightening aspect is that all of this material is not merely tame and floating around but rather moving at speeds as high as 17,000 miles per hour (27,000 km per hour) with each object varying in direction as it\u2019s affected by the Earth\u2019s gravitational field. Friction of an object against the atmosphere will also cause some objects to fall in altitude. At these speeds, a screw can have the same impact as a high-speed car, potentially destroying an entire satellite. These are the same satellites we depend on for everything from communication to ATM withdrawals to monitoring of the Earth\u2019s ecosystems. Avoiding collisions through evasive maneuvers uses up the satellite\u2019s fuel and time, making it less efficient than it could be. Even more problematic is the fact that most objects in orbit cannot be controlled from Earth so there\u2019s no way to interfere with debris on a collision course.\nThis is the fear addressed by the Kessler Syndrome. It was a theory proposed 41 years ago by NASA scientist Donald Kessler. The theory describes an ongoing collision of debris where an initial incident continues to cascade into another and another, giving way to an exponential rise of debris around the planet. In fact, some scientists believe the effect might already have been put into place by the events of 2009.\nThat year, an operational Iridium satellite and a defunct Russian satellite struck one another at the rate of 26 miles per hour (42 km) and created 2,000 new pieces of debris. This occurred at Earth\u2019s polar orbits at a height of 490 miles (789 km) in altitude. This area at the poles is considered to carry the highest risk of debris collision.\nWhile most causes of debris are accidental, like the incident above, an unsavory plan in 2007 angered many countries across the world. China destroyed a weather satellite and created thousands of new pieces of junk orbiting above us right now. The test itself was already controversial, aimed to test their capabilities of destroying objects in space. The US also caused a lot of pollution in the 1960\u2019s when it sent millions of copper needles into space to improve radio communications. While some of these needles came back down, thousands of clumps of copper still reside up there to this day.\nAnd since the 1960\u2019s, space\u2019s artificial population of objects continues to grow rapidly with 400 new satellites having entered orbit in 2017 alone. This number doesn\u2019t seem to be going down. SpaceX received approval last year to launch 12,000 new satellites and they\u2019re only one among many companies with plans to deploy similar satellites in the near future. Technology like CubeStats \u2014 small scale satellites enabling research groups and companies to have access to space \u2014 are cost effective and accessible, meaning they\u2019re being increasingly deployed as well. If these rates continue to increase and nothing is done about the problem, collisions can become up to 25 times more likely, meaning that spaceflight would be almost impossible.\nA little over a decade ago, agencies developed guidelines for the launch of spacecraft. Satellites should turn off batteries and vent all fuel and combustible material to avoid in-orbit explosions. The altitude of these satellites should also be low enough that they will naturally burn up after 25 years, meaning they should come below 372 miles (600 km). This foresight is known as the passivation of objects. Debris will burn up upon re-entry to Earth\u2019s atmosphere, though this does come with the potential for larger pieces of debris to land in populated areas. Only half of all missions abide by these guidelines.\nUnfortunately, a critical point for space debris has already been reached. Even if no further launches were to take place, the number of objects would continue to increase as more and more collisions occurred. The only long-term solution is to remove 5\u201310 large objects from orbit each year. And experts urge us to begin this process of removal now. Proposals for cleaning up space include nets to capture objects, lasers to guide them into re-entry, and large magnets to attract the pieces. But technology for managing space debris is still under testing and development. For now, the best agencies are able to do is to track the moving objects.\nArtificial intelligence with neural networks \u2014 the machine equivalent of a human brain \u2014 can be used to track debris and give a prediction of where it will be in the future. The AI is capable of learning from its mistakes and becoming more accurate as time goes on. It could also suggest the best launch times since research shows that even a difference of 15 minutes in launch time can influence how long it will take a satellite to come back down. Massive data sets are not only cataloging objects but also studying sizes and shapes in order to better asses the danger a piece of debris will pose.\nEveryday, 21 warnings of space collisions are issued by the US military. And while we think of pollution of our oceans as having a great impact on human and animal life, it\u2019s important to remember that pollution of space impacts our lives just as much. Our societies and economies are reliant upon those satellites, now vulnerable to severe damage from our past endeavors. Not to mention the risk faced by astronauts onboard the ISS. A future in which we cannot continue to explore \u2014 whether that be space, land, or oceans \u2014 is a dismal one, and one which would strip us of a very important part of our humanity.\n", "link": "https://medium.com/futuresin/the-kessler-syndrome-closing-off-earth-from-space-8126bd13bebb", "author": "Ella Alderson", "comments": [], "claps": "460 claps"}, {"num_comments": "unspecified", "title": "Saving the Coral Reefs \u2013 Jun Wu \u2013 Medium", "tags": [], "reading_time": 4, "text": "Global Cooperation is Saving the Coral Reefs Worldwide.\nThe Great Barrier Reef is the largest coral reef system located in the Coral Sea, off the coast of Queensland, Australia.

They come here in search of something worth reading. Something substantial. And you can give it to them.\nMedium\u2019s algorithms put you on a level playing field. Your stories can dominate news feeds. You can crack Medium\u2019s Top Stories list. You can beat out professional writers and celebrities.\nI\u2019ll show you how.\nBut why should you care what some software developer has to say about writing?\nBecause over the past 30 days, I\u2019ve averaged 12,000 views per day on my Medium stories. Medium\u2019s readers have recommended my stories 13,000 times. And I\u2019m the editor of one of Medium\u2019s largest publications.\nIn short, I know what writing works here on Medium.\nBut good writing won\u2019t help you if you can\u2019t get people\u2019s attention.\nAs a writer, you fight a war against indifference. You have to force people to care enough to click through to your story. You have to convince them to take a chance on you.\nYou have only two weapons against the relentless scroll of news feeds: a headline and an image.\nHere\u2019s what a story looks like in Medium\u2019s news feed:\nHere\u2019s what it looks like on Facebook:\nAnd here\u2019s what it looks like on Twitter:\nYour headline and opening image are the only things people have to judge your story on. Before they can even read your story\u2019s first paragraph, they must answer a question. It\u2019s the same question that we all ask ourselves every day: is this going to be worth my time?\nYour first job as a writer is to choose a headline and image that will make people answer \u201cyes.\u201d\nYour headline is the most important part of your story. Spend time refining it.\nBuzzFeed built a publishing empire on the back of compelling headlines. Here\u2019s a a lexical analysis of 60,000 BuzzFeed headlines, and what works best for them.\nI am not saying you should use BuzzFeed-like headlines. But you should be aware of them. They\u2019re filled with hyperbole and fear-of-missing-out. Think about what their effectiveness says about human psychology and the nature news feeds.\nHere are some types of headlines that work well on Medium:\nHow long should your headline be? HubSpot analyzed 6,000 blog posts and found that stories with 8 to 14-word headlines get more social media shares.\nAnother consideration is how emotional a headline is. The more emotional (positive or negative) a headline is, the more likely people will click it.\nHere\u2019s a tool that helps you balance the length and sentiment of your headlines.\nHeadlines are traditionally written in \u201ctitle case.\u201d The Associated Press says to \u201ccapitalize the first letter of every word except articles, coordinating conjunctions, and prepositions of three letters or fewer.\u201d\nOn Medium, I often throw title case out the window and just write headlines like a normal sentence. I even include punctuation as necessary. This format is more conversational, and easier to read.\nThe second most important aspect of your story is its opening image.\nMedium assigns your opening image the og-image meta property. This means that your opening image will serve as your story\u2019s ambassador everywhere: social media news feeds, Reddit, Google News \u2014 even RSS readers.\nFor this story, I chose an image of Emma Stone portraying an aspiring journalist at her typewriter in the 1960s. It\u2019s from the popular 2011 period movie \u201cThe Help.\u201d\nA stock photo of someone sitting at their laptop would have looked too generic. Our news feeds are already filled with these pictures.\nIf you do want to use stock photos, though, there are a ton of free creative commons-licensed stock photos you can use in your stories.\nI recommend keeping photos thematically consistent throughout your story. Here\u2019s another image of Emma Stone\u2019s character writing. This helps to break up long stretches of text.\nOn one story, I used only images from The Dark Knight trilogy:\nAnd I only used images of Peggy Olsen from Mad Men for another:\nThese stories don\u2019t mention The Dark Knight or Mad Men in their text. The images are there to visually reinforce each story\u2019s message, while lending them flavor.\nAnother popular technique is to emblazon your story\u2019s headline across your opening image. My friend Kristyna did this on the most-recommended story ever on Medium:\nStart considering images early in the writing process. And never publish without at least one image. Otherwise your story will be all but invisible in news feeds.\nOnce your reader clicks through to your story, the trial begins. They are looking for any excuse to jump back to their news feed. Reading requires a lot more effort than scrolling through cat photos.\nDon\u2019t waste time with intros or updates \u2014 start making points and telling your story immediately.\nFigure out a way to establish your credibility within the first few paragraphs. If you are a top expert in your field, say so. Don\u2019t assume that people are going to take the time to google you.\nAre you writing about health as a non-physician? Are you writing about personal finance as a non-millionaire? You\u2019ll need to overcome any skepticism readers may have about your credibility.\nI established my credibility as a writer earlier by posting my recent Medium stats. You\u2019ll need to find an achievement you can trumpet. Something that gives your readers the impression that \u201cthis person knows what they\u2019re talking about.\u201d\nReinforce your credibility throughout your story. Support your arguments with data. Use inline links to (non-paywalled) research.\nThis isn\u2019t the New England Journal of Medicine. This is Medium. So don\u2019t use footnotes.\nGood writing is hard. Like any skill, it takes practice. There are no shortcuts to becoming a strong writer.\nDo yourself a favor: write what you know.\nHave you ever heard the term \u201cwriters block?\u201d Writer\u2019s block happens when you don\u2019t know enough about a topic to write about it. The antidote is research. Learning. Going out into the field.\nDon\u2019t publish anything you\u2019re not proud of. Medium isn\u2019t a numbers game. It\u2019s a social contract. People follow you. In turn, you show respect for their scarce time.\nGood Medium stories don\u2019t come naturally. For every minute of story length, expect to spend at least an hour writing, re-writing, and editing your story.\nSpeaking of story length...\nMedium\u2019s data scientists found that 7 minutes is the optimal length for a Medium story.\nIn practice, a story should be as long as it needs to be, and no longer.\nIf you can\u2019t come up with at least 5 minutes worth of thoughts, rethink the premise of your story.\nOne exception to this is stories that are mostly images, embeds, or code.\nJust because many of your readers went to college does not mean they enjoy reading at a college level. And many of them will be non-native English speakers.\nPaste your story into the Hemingway Editor. This will highlight dense sentences, adverbs, passive voice, and other style issues. It will also assign a grade level to your overall writing.\nDespite what you may have learned in English composition class, people prefer short paragraphs to \u201cwalls of text.\u201d\nThere\u2019s nothing wrong with single-sentence paragraphs.\nErr on the side of creating new paragraphs.\nMedium allows you to add up to five tags to your story. Use them.\nPeople follow specific topics on Medium. The most popular ones are #tech, #life-lessons, #travel, #design, and #startup.\nPeople who follow the tags you use may see your article in their news feed. Tags also make it easier for people to stumble upon your story in search results.\nOnce you hit publish, your story will begin to \u201cdecay\u201d in Medium\u2019s recommendation engine. As time passes, it will show up in fewer news feeds. The only way to counteract this decay is to get more views and recommends.\nThe first few hours are critical. Be sure to get a few recommends on your story immediately. These will serve as a proof of concept.\nPeer pressure is powerful. Humans are much more likely to click that recommend heart if others humans have already done so.\nShare your story on Facebook, Twitter, and LinkedIn. You can view your story\u2019s stats in real time. Ask for feedback from your friends and followers. Incorporate this feedback into your story.\nOnce people have recommended your story, share it on relevant Reddit subreddits and Facebook groups.\nIf you have a mailing list, you can blast it out to your subscribers, too.\nAnother way to reach a much larger audience is by syndicating your story in one of Medium\u2019s publications. These are communities of writers and editors who specialize in writing about a few key topics, such as health or education.\nFor example, Free Code Camp\u2019s Medium publication (for which I\u2019m an editor) focuses on development, design, and data science. It has more than 50,000 followers.\nWhen a publication syndicates your story, it will show up in the news feeds of its followers. Publications can also feature your story on their landing pages.\nFind out who the editors of these publications are and pitch your story to them.\nMedium is still quite new. Most people don\u2019t understand how its recommend and follow mechanisms work.\nHere\u2019s my final tip for expanding your readership here on Medium: include instructions and a custom GIF image at the bottom of your stories. This will show people how to recommend your story and follow you.\nI only write about programming and technology. If you follow me on Twitter I won\u2019t waste your time. \ud83d\udc4d\n", "link": "https://medium.freecodecamp.org/how-to-write-medium-stories-people-will-actually-read-92e58a27c8d8", "author": "Quincy Larson", "comments": ["<img class=\"progressiveMedia-noscript js-progressiveMedia-inner\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/400/1*rDGhi8Xrpwai2RKaEe_i9w.jpeg\">Excellent article!

I will go ahead and say an unpopular opinion: It\u2019s NOT easy. I don\u2019t care how many \u201cmake money fast from home\u201d articles there are out there; it\u2019s really not that easy.\nI have recently decided to follow my dream of becoming a blogger and you can read up on it here:\nThis is a very important decision you\u2019re about to make. Not just because of the money you spend going self hosted but also because of the amount of work you\u2019re committing to.\nDon\u2019t just go by what \u201chow to make money from home fast\u201d articles say. You\u2019ve got to do the research yourself and not let yourself get scammed. You don\u2019t want to commit to something you will later regret signing on for.\nDon\u2019t get me wrong, I still am happy to be blogging. However, all of the popups on Facebook and \u201cmake money from home quickly\u201d articles on Pinterest failed to tell me how much work really goes into having your own site.\nOf course, I did a bit of research but the way the articles made it seem- was that it was super easy and a FAST way to make income being at home. That\u2019s false. My fault for believing what I read from a few articles.\nOne of the most difficult things bloggers face is staying ahead on content. I post twice a week and I am aiming to be at least a month ahead on content. That\u2019s easier said than done.\nYou can have a pretty smooth month when you have nothing important going on, but when you do have a hectic month you need to be busy creating for the next month, so you can fall behind and fairly quickly. That\u2019s also something to keep in mind before you agree to making your blogging website into a business.\nThe most important thing you want to do for your website is to always have worthwhile content on there. Those blog posts on your website represent YOU. Making sure your blog posts are something you are proud of becomes a blogger\u2019s number one concern and quite frankly, becomes an obsession.\nBlogging takes up a lot of time and so does creating new ideas. You\u2019re constantly visualizing how to create your own pins and graphics to drive more traffic to your site. Because the sole purpose of a successful blogger is a creative outlet that allows you to earn an income.\nMy advice: Be wary. If you\u2019re on the fence about starting your own website do your research first and foremost. If this seems to be the perfect fit by all means go for it. Us readers always want great new and helpful reading material.\nPersonally I don\u2019t regret starting my website, however knowing what I know today I would have started a few years back when I had more time. It\u2019s always good to have a nice gap of time where you can focus on building your website before taking any needed breaks, or in my case raising my littles.\n", "link": "https://medium.com/swlh/the-difficulties-bloggers-face-85831066af2", "author": "Noemi McElearney", "comments": [], "claps": "325 claps"}, {"num_comments": 1, "title": "I will not cry and if I do its because of the Sahara dust that has made its way into my home.", "tags": ["social media", "superheroes", "blogger", "journalism", "satire"], "reading_time": 9, "text": "I will not cry and if I do its because of the Sahara dust that has made its way into my home.\nSo after posting on fb, I\u2019m gonna have to do this...\n\u201cSuperHeroes today don\u2019t wear capes, they use a pen to highlight mistakes they keep on writing in the face of adversity,\nThey write and they write to help humanity.\nSuperHeroes don\u2019t wear capes anymore, no they don\u2019t,\nThey are listening and watching and never far from the telephone,\nThey give us the news, they are competeing with the lies, the untruths that are spoken from puesdo presidential types.\nSuperHeroes don\u2019t wear capes but are the holders of words, custodians of hope in an upside down world.

I mean, who wouldn\u2019t want to hire me? I had just been awarded Massachusetts\u2019 Latin teacher of the year award, I had seven years of experience in one of the most prestigious school districts in the country, and I was guaranteed to be the only African-American applying for those jobs. I\u2019m basically a unicorn!\nVirtually every single school district I looked into listed hiring more teachers of color as a major priority. One department chair had even written an article lamenting the lack of diversity in teaching staff and among students in upper level Latin classes. I could honestly say that I was looking forward to getting out there and weighing my options. Little did I know that selecting a worthy suitor would be the least of my concerns.\nI strolled confidently into the office of the aforementioned department chair for my first interview in years. The school was a large suburban high school outside of Boston. I scanned the room and was not at all surprised to see only white faces. I drew attention to my experience, my recent awards and my commitment to diversity and inclusion. The interview seemed friendly and fun, and the interviewers were upbeat and affable. I left the interview feeling good.\nWeeks rolled by, and I heard no word. I was confused but still optimistic. I mean, how could I have turned off a department that seemed so committed to increasing diversity in their school?\nFinally, I received an email stating that I was not being moved forward in the process. Not only did I not get the job, but I wasn\u2019t even a finalist. I wasn\u2019t even close. Little did I know, district #1 still had a role to play in my twisted drama.\nAs I waited to hear back from the handful of schools to which I applied, I received an invitation for another interview. This time from a middle school \u2014 my specialty \u2014 in another affluent suburban district. This one had to go well.\nI was brought into a bright little office. I sat down across from a principal and a department head, both white. I proceeded to gleefully answer their questions. The vibe was a little weird, but I didn\u2019t think too much of it. The principal came across as bored and like he was just going through the motions. At no point did he seem remotely interested in me as a candidate.\nIt seemed as though they must have decided on someone before I had even shown up, so I wasn\u2019t all that shocked when I received a rejection email from district #2. As the weeks rolled by, I began to receive more rejection emails from districts that had declined to even bring me in for an interview. I resigned myself to return to my former district and try again next year.\nFast forward a year. This time I wasn\u2019t desperately trying to find a job right at the end of the summer. I was a little rattled by the previous year, but I was refreshed and ready to start over again.\nEnter district #3. The perfect job in the perfect district. The kind of job that only appears once in a lifetime. I had to have it. Another wonderful suburban district in Eastern Massachusetts that seemed too good to be true. I applied and was called in for an interview.\nI entered the room and was met by a large group of extremely warm and inviting educators. All of the faces were white, but all of them were smiling. Each question perfectly mirrored my values as an educator, and I felt almost moved to tears by their focus on meeting the needs of all types of students. I left that interview floating on a cloud of optimism. I just had to be a finalist for this one.\nWeeks rolled by. Now I was really confused. There was just no possible way that I wasn\u2019t a finalist for this job. I had given the best of myself to that interview. I waited and waited until it finally came. Another lovely automated rejection email.\nNow I was really starting to get nervous, but I hadn\u2019t reached total desperation yet, because an even better opportunity had fallen into my lap. District #4 was to be my savior.\nI walked into the interview room of yet another affluent suburban high school. Unlike at the other schools, the person leading the interview was a person of color! I instantly felt comfortable and at ease. Once again, I left the interview feeling great. But then again, I felt the same when I left my other interviews.\nNot much time passed before I was invited back in to teach sample lesson. I had a lovely interview with the principal, who informed me that I would be hearing from them soon. Everything seemed to be going well.\nWeeks roll by. Finally, I hear that I\u2019ve been invited in for another interview with the principal. I suddenly have a very bad feeling. Why was I being asked in for a whole new interview with the same principal? This just didn\u2019t add up.\nI returned to the principal\u2019s office. I was shocked to see a large table with lots of unfamiliar faces. This wasn\u2019t just an interview with the principal, it was with a whole new committee! The room was full of skeptical white faces except for the person of color who had led my first interview. He sat near me, but was no longer in control of the process. The principal led the conversation, and the tone was totally different.\nThe questions all had an air of skepticism, like an interrogation. I got the distinct impression that they were searching for a justification not to hire me. I looked often to the one non-white face in the room for reassurance, but his expression felt like a silent apology. I left the interview feeling utterly defeated.\nMore weeks pass by. Suddenly, I receive word that they are going to check my references! I jumped for joy: no one ever checks your references until they have decided to hire you, right? Until I find out that they\u2019re also checking the references of another finalist.\nNot only was the administrator of color checking my references, but the white principal was also contacting the exact same references. It became clear to me at this point that there were two separate processes going on. Why was this happening?\nAnother few weeks pass, and finally I receive the email I had been waiting for all of this time. I excitedly opened it and felt my heart crash as I read the same automated rejection note I had received so many times before.\nAfter three long months of waiting to hear my fate from district #4, I was out of options. I was devolving rapidly and could feel a full-blown panic attack coming on, when I remembered that I was moments away from an appointment.\nIronically, the teacher who was hired by district #1, not a person of color, had used my article Why Students Of Color Don\u2019t Study Latin in her classes and had invited me to Skype in as a guest speaker. I managed to hold myself together in front of the kids, but I was not in a good place.\nI couldn\u2019t escape the cruel irony of the situation in my head. Here I was, the subject of study in a classroom that had previously deemed me unworthy of leading it. The students asked me questions about what it was like to be a classicist of color. I held back tears, answered their questions honestly, and, for the first time, considered quitting teaching altogether.\nAt this point, I won\u2019t lie, I was desperate. I started to apply to part-time jobs, hoping that I could break through that way. I interviewed at yet another suburban high school in Eastern Massachusetts. I was in a room with two people, a principal and a department chair, both white. I was asked several questions about diversity and inclusive practices. I felt uniquely qualified to answer their questions.\nA few weeks pass and suddenly, like clockwork, I get the same automated rejection email in my inbox. I couldn\u2019t even land a part time job. At this point I had been rejected for every Latin teacher job in the state of Massachusetts, a state in which I had just been named Latin teacher of the year.\nI felt like a total failure. I was going to have to sell my home and move my kids away from their school and friends. This also meant that my wife would have to leave a fantastic job because I needed us to relocate to find work. At this point, I had actually resolved to leave the teaching profession altogether. I went so far as to cancel workshops and seriously explore a midlife career change.\nAfter some words of encouragement from friends and family, I decided to give teaching one more chance. Once I started looking outside of Massachusetts, I was shocked by the results. I started receiving offers from all over the country. Miraculously, the things I had to offer seemed appealing to all of these other people. Finally, I was able to land the last job posted in Massachusetts in a small town in the western part of the state.\nDespite that last minute success, I still needed to upend my family and relocate because of my inability to find a job anywhere near me. What happened? Why was I treated so differently by schools outside of my region? Why did I struggle so mightily in a place where I had previously experienced so much success?\nAlmost zero diversity in hiring committees. I noticed exactly one person of color. One. One person of color in all of the interviews I attended. Let that sink in. The one person of color I did encounter appeared to be actively undermined throughout the process. I am aware that the field of Classics is extremely white, but that\u2019s no excuse for having all-white hiring committees for Classics jobs.\nEmpty platitudes without action. I received zero job offers from places that went out of their way to tout their commitment to diversity. No school that asked me specific questions about diversity and inclusivity offered me a job or even chose me as a finalist.\nLatin teachers are part of the problem. Most hiring committees included current or retiring Latin teachers and those teachers were always white. I received zero offers, including out-of-state, at any school that already had a Latin teacher. If Latin teachers have a say in the matter, it is their duty to push for more inclusive hiring practices.\nI would be lying if I said that I didn\u2019t still feel frustrated by my experience. I felt hurt, shocked, rejected and all of the normal emotions that one feels in that situation. I ran through the various interviews in my head a thousand times and couldn\u2019t figure out what had totally disqualified me.\nUnfortunately, I can\u2019t exactly reach out to the people who didn\u2019t hire me and ask, \u201cHey. Did you not hire me because I\u2019m black?\u201d Even if the answer was \u201cyes\u201d, I highly doubt that I would get that as a response. So I\u2019m just left wondering why I was such an unattractive candidate in my home state, but nowhere else.\nThe field of Classics has a race problem. I am one of the few African-Americans in the field of Classics, and I had all but quit because I couldn\u2019t get hired. If an African-American with my experience, awards and credentials has this much difficulty landing a teaching job, what does that say about the state of our profession? We are not teaching, recruiting, or hiring people of color. We have been collectively talking ourselves into maintaining the status quo, and have been making excuses for keeping the field white. Given the current state of affairs, why would a young person of color interested in Classics even want to enter a field that is so hostile to diversity? This has to change and change now, or else Classics as a discipline will continue to die its slow death on the hill of white exclusivity.\nJohn Bracey is a high school Latin teacher, who spends his days fighting the good fight and trying to make Latin classes more inclusive to everyone. He has a website, magisterbracey.com, where he blogs about teaching Latin with Comprehensible Input.\n", "link": "https://eidolon.pub/after-careful-consideration-7c50172d0aa3", "author": "John Bracey", "comments": [], "claps": "112 claps"}, {"num_comments": 11, "title": "We Should Stop Saying \u201cPeople of Color\u201d When We Mean \u201cBlack People\u201d", "tags": ["language", "people of color", "racism", "black", "words"], "reading_time": 4, "text": "I understand why people in society use the term \u201cpeople of color\u201d: it replaces the outdated term \u201ccolored people\u201d with one that is more personable and palatable; it allows for a kind of political solidarity between the non-white citizens of the country and the world; it acknowledges the ways in which racism and white supremacy affect people from many groups (not just Black people), and is a platform for their collective shared experiences, concerns, etc.\nThat being said, we need to stop saying \u201cpeople of color\u201d in instances we mostly (and sometimes only) mean \u201cBlack people.\u201d\nWhat I\u2019m saying is a bit meta, but the public use of the term POC seems to have become less about solidarity, and more concerned with lessening the negative connotations and implicit anti-Black reactions (fear, scorn, disdain, apathy) to Blackness. In popular discourse, POC is often a shorthand for \u201cthis issue affects Black people most directly and disproportionately, but other non-white people are affected too, so we need to include them for people to listen and so people to understand we aren\u2019t talking about race as only Black vs. white.\u201d\nSaying POC when we mean \u201cBlack people\u201d is this concession that there\u2019s a need to describe a marginalized group as \u201cless\u201d Black for in order for people (specifically, but not only, white people) to have empathy for whatever issue being discussed.\nWhen I taught a journalism class at DePaul University, two of my students wrote in a media critique assignment that we should use \u201cAfrican-American\u201d because the term \u201cBlack\u201d has negative connotations. Ironically, they wrote those claims, even though I, their instructor, had referred to himself as \u201cBlack\u201d in class multiple times. In essentially every instance in which one of my students at Salem State mentioned something about police brutality in an assignment, I can\u2019t remember any of them not using \u201cpeople of color\u201d (two students actually used the term \u201ccolored people\u201d), even though local or national discussions on police brutality almost always involve Black victims.\nTo reiterate, the use of \u201cperson of color\u201d is legitimate and there are plenty of situations where it\u2019s appropriate to use the term. One example is if you are discussing why Hollywood should take greater steps for inclusion and diversity, it makes perfect sense to use \u201cpeople of color\u201d to describe the issue.\nBut if you were raising questions about the lack of Native representation in films, using them as an example of how Hollywood needs more \u201cpeople of color\u201d evades the issue. I\u2019d argue that saying \u201cwe need more Native representation in film\u201d is not only a more direct way to address the problem, but it properly centralizes the specific concerns and issues of the Native film community, and directs you to the spaces where the solutions can be found \u2014 Native communities.\nSeveral racial and ethnic communities (including white people) are negatively affected by the school-to-prison pipeline or police brutality. However, the oppressive systems which spur these phenomena impact the Black community to a much greater degree (and to an extent were historically designed for that specific outcome). Other groups might face housing discrimination, but the history of redlining in America is a specific response to Black people migrating from the South to northern and western cities.\nWhen President Franklin D. Roosevelt signed Executive Order 9066, Japanese citizens were forced into internment camps. Describing that period as act of racism against \u201cpeople of color\u201d erases the extremely specific historical wrongdoing towards Japanese Americans. When President Trump makes fun of Sen. Elizabeth Warren by calling her \u201cPocahontas,\u201d that dig is disrespectful to Native people, not \u201cpeople of color.\u201d\nIt seems like every week we see a new video of people calling the police on Black people for merely existing in public. Every few weeks there\u2019s another story of a police officer shooting an unarmed Black person because they \u201cfeared for their life.\u201d Yes, other groups face systemic oppression, but while using POC in these contexts isn\u2019t inaccurate, it feels misleading. A \u201cPeople of Color Lives Matter\u201d movement would be useful, but we can understand why \u201cBlack Lives Matter\u201d has a more specific resonance.\nFor me, \u201cpeople of color\u201d feels like a hiding place, like I have to hide a crucial part of me in order to not tap into the reactionary fear or apathy towards Blackness. Describing myself as POC feels like walking into a space with an apology in hand.\nJames Baldwin once said that \u201cThe plea is simple\u2013 look at it.\u201d Words can be either mirrors, reflecting the world as it is; or prisms, which have the potential to amplify, but also distort. Our struggle as a society is to find mirrors.\nBut maybe my simpler plea is for people to know that\u2019s its okay to call me Black. And if you feel it isn\u2019t, I still insist that you do.\n", "link": "https://medium.com/@journojoshua/we-should-stop-saying-people-of-color-when-we-mean-black-people-29c2b18e6267", "author": "Joshua Adams", "comments": [], "claps": "1.5K claps"}, {"num_comments": 152, "title": "IQ is largely a pseudoscientific swindle \u2013 INCERTO \u2013 Medium", "tags": ["alt right", "racism", "data science", "psychology", "black swan"], "reading_time": 11, "text": "(Revised draft: added comments on sinister country profiling. Also 1) Turns out IQ beats random selection in the best of applications by less than 6%, typically <2%, as the computation of correlations have a flaw. 2) Showed noise IQ/Weath, 3) Added information showing the story behind the effectiveness of Average National IQ is, statistically, a fraud. The psychologists who engaged me on this piece \u2014 with verbose writeups \u2014made the mistake of showing me the best they got: papers with the strongest pro-IQ arguments. They do not seem to grasp what noise/signal really means.)\nBackground : \u201cIQ\u201d is a stale test meant to measure mental capacity but in fact mostly measures extreme unintelligence (learning difficulties), as well as, to a lesser extent (with a lot of noise), a form of intelligence, stripped of 2nd order effects \u2014 how good someone is at taking some type of exams designed by unsophisticated nerds. It is via negativa not via positiva. Designed for learning disabilities, and given that it is not too needed there (see argument further down), it ends up selecting for exam-takers, paper shufflers, obedient IYIs (intellectuals yet idiots), ill adapted for \u201creal life\u201d. (The fact that it correlates with general incompetence makes the overall correlation look high, even when it is random, see Figures 1 and 2.) The concept is poorly thought out mathematically by the field (commits a severe flaw in correlation under fat tails; fails to properly deal with dimensionality; treats the mind as an instrument not a complex system), and seems to be promoted by\nSome argue that IQ measures intellectual capacity \u2014 real world results come from, in addition, \u201cwisdom\u201d or patience, or \u201cconscientiousness\u201d, or decision-making or something of the sort. No. It does not even measure intellectual capacity/mental powers.\nIf you want to detect how someone fares at a task, say loan sharking, tennis playing, or random matrix theory, make him/her do that task; we don\u2019t need theoretical exams for a real world function by probability-challenged psychologists. Traders get it right away: hypothetical P/L from \u201csimulated\u201d paper strategies doesn\u2019t count. Performance=actual. What goes in people\u2019s head as a reaction to an image on a screen doesn\u2019t exist (except via negativa).\nFat Tails If IQ is Gaussian by construction (well, almost) and if real world performance were, net, fat tailed (it is), then either the covariance between IQ and performance doesn\u2019t exist or it is uninformational. It will show a finite number in sample but doesn\u2019t exist statistically \u2014 and the metrics will overestimare the predictability. Another problem: when they say \u201cblack people are x standard deviations away\u201d, they don\u2019t know what they are talking about. Different populations have different variances, even different skewness and these comparisons require richer models. These are severe, severe mathematical flaws (a billion papers in psychometrics wouldn\u2019t count if you have such a flaw). See the formal treatment in my next book.\nBut the \u201cintelligence\u201d in IQ is determined by academic psychologists (no geniuses) like the \u201cpaper trading\u201d we mentioned above, via statistical constructs s.a. correlation that I show here (see Fig. 1) that they patently don\u2019t understand. It does correlate to very negative performance (as it was initially designed to detect learning special needs) but then any measure would work there. A measure that works in the left tail not the right tail (IQ decorrelates as it goes higher) is problematic. We have gotten similar results since the famous Terman longitudinal study, even with massaged data for later studies. To get the point, consider that if someone has mental needs, there will be 100% correlation between performance and IQ tests. But the performance doesn\u2019t correlate as well at higher levels, though, unaware of the effect of the nonlinearity, the psychologists will think it does.(The statistical spin, as a marketing argument, is that a person with an IQ of 70 cannot prove theorems, which is obvious for a measure of unintelligence \u2014 but they fail to reveal how many IQs of 150 are doing menial jobs).\nIt is a false comparison to claim that IQ \u201cmeasures the hardware\u201d rather than the software. It can measures some arbitrarily selected mental abilities (in a testing environment) believed to be useful. However, if you take a Popperian-Hayekian view on intelligence, you would realize that to measure future needs it you would need to know the mental skills needed in a future ecology, which requires predictability of said future ecology. It also requires the skills to make it to the future (hence the need for mental biases for survival).\nReal Life: In academia there is no difference between academia and the real world; in the real world there is. 1) When someone asks you a question in the real world, you focus first on \u201cwhy is he/she asking me that?\u201d, which shifts you to the environment (see Fat Tony vs Dr John in The Black Swan) and detracts you from the problem at hand. Philosophers have known about that problem forever. Only suckers don\u2019t have that instinct. Further, take the sequence {1,2,3,4,x}. What should x be? Only someone who is clueless about induction would answer 5 as if it were the only answer (see Goodman\u2019s problem in a philosophy textbook or ask your closest Fat Tony) [Note: We can also apply here Wittgenstein\u2019s rule-following problem, which states that any of an infinite number of functions is compatible with any finite sequence. Source: Paul Bogossian]. Not only clueless, but obedient enough to want to think in a certain way. 2) Real life never never offers crisp questions with crisp answers (most questions don\u2019t have answers; perhaps the worst problem with IQ is that it seem to selects for people who don\u2019t like to say \u201cthere is no answer, don\u2019t waste time, find something else\u201d.) 3) It takes a certain type of person to waste intelligent concentration on classroom/academic problems. These are lifeless bureaucrats who can muster sterile motivation. Some people can only focus on problems that are real, not fictional textbook ones (see the note below where I explain that I can only concentrate with real not fictional problems). 4) IQ doesn\u2019t detect convexity of mistakes (by an argument similar to bias-variance you need to make a lot of small inconsequential mistake in order to avoid a large consequential one. See Antifragile and how any measure of \u201cintelligence\u201d w/o convexity is sterile edge.org/conversation/n...). To do well you must survive; survival requires some mental biases directing to some errors. 5) Fooled by Randomness: seeing shallow patterns in not a virtue \u2014 it leads to naive interventionism. Some psychologist wrote back to me: \u201cIQ selects for pattern recognition, essential for functioning in modern society\u201d. No. Not seeing patterns except when they are significant is a virtue in real life. 6) To do well in life you need depth and ability to select your own problems and to think independently.\nNational IQ is a Fraud. From engaging participants (who throw buzzwords at you), I realized that the concept has huge variance, enough to be uninformative. See graph. And note that the variance within populations is not used to draw conclusions (you average over functions, don\u2019t use the funciton over averages) \u2014 a problem acute for tail contributions.\nRecall from Antifragile that if wealth were fat tailed, you\u2019d need to focus on the tail minority (for which IQ has unpredictable payoff), never the average. Further it is leading to racist imbeciles who think that if a country has an IQ of 82 (assuming it is true not the result of lack of such training), it means politically that all the people there have an IQ of 82, hence let\u2019s ban them from immigrating. As I said they don\u2019t even get elementary statistical notions such as variance. Some people use National IQ as a basis for genetic differences: it doesn\u2019t explain the sharp changes in Ireland and Croatia upon European integration, or, in the other direction, the difference between Israeli and U.S. Ashkenazis.\nAdditional Variance: Unlike measurements of height or wealth, which carry a tiny relative error, many people get yuugely different results for the same IQ test (I mean the same person!), up to 2 standard deviations as measured across people, higher than sampling error in the population itself! This additional source of sampling error weakens the effect by propagation of uncertainty way beyond its predictability when applied to the evaluation of a single individual. It also tells you that you as an individual are vastly more diverse than the crowd, at least with respect to that measure!\nBiases in Research: If, as psychologists show (see figure) MDs and academics tend to have a higher \u201cIQ\u201d that is slightly informative (higher, but on a noisy average), it is largely because to get into schools you need to score on a test similar to \u201cIQ\u201d. The mere presence of such a filter increases the visible mean and lower the visible variance. Probability and statistics confuse fools.\nFunctionary Quotient: If you renamed IQ , from \u201cIntelligent Quotient\u201d to FQ \u201cFunctionary Quotient\u201d or SQ \u201cSalaryperson Quotient\u201d, then some of the stuff will be true. It measures best the ability to be a good slave confined to linear tasks. \u201cIQ\u201d is good for @davidgraeber\u2019s \u201cBS jobs\u201d.\nMetrification: If someone came up w/a numerical\u201cWell Being Quotient\u201d WBQ or \u201cSleep Quotient\u201d, SQ, trying to mimic temperature or a physical quantity, you\u2019d find it absurd. But put enough academics w/physics envy and race hatred on it and it will become an official measure.\nCURSE OF DIMENSIONALITY A flaw in the attempts to identify \u201cintelligence\u201d genes.

Not a work dinner or a networking thing \u2014 a date. Rhys was nice looking, funny, new in town, and persistent about helping me weed our overgrown community garden. Persistent, too, about taking me to some \u201cjazz club\u201d I was sure to love.\nHe regaled me with stories of his woke liberal politics (Hillary) and his commitment to equality (Black Lives Matter). And then, as he ordered a second bottle of wine, he delivered the ultimate compliment \u2014 \u201cYou are such a beautiful woman. I just love your complexion. You could be Italian or something!\u201d\nBad enough that he didn\u2019t know the difference between a jazz band and a swing band.\nMy life as a black woman in America has trained me to \u201cfeed white men with a long-handled spoon\u201d, as my grandmother would say. I can never relax completely, even in casual interactions. I\u2019m always on guard, always preparing for the assault. And too often, it comes in the form of microaggressions, micro-insults and micro-invalidations.\nMicroaggressions are \u201cmicro\u201d because they\u2019re tiny incidents with massive impact. An insult that sounds like a compliment on the surface, but has as its baseline premise the idea that \u201cwhiteness\u201d is not only the norm, but the standard to strive for.\nMicroaggressions include demeaning comments made by well-intentioned white people who may not be consciously aware of the hidden messages. Even so, just because a perpetrator of racism is clueless (or in denial) about the impact of their words, microaggressions are still acts of violence. Intention is irrelevant.\nThese are more overt verbal and nonverbal communications that demean my racial heritage or identity. They can be as simple as a Confederate flag bumper sticker, or as complex as getting passed over for promotion.\nAs black women, we are conditioned to question ourselves and not the perpetrators. We have been too often silenced or ignored or erased in other settings, leading to a certain amount of self-doubt. Am I reading too much into this? Do I have a chip on my shoulder? Maybe they didn\u2019t mean it that way.\nBut failing to speak up allows these micro battles to become macro war zones.\nElegantly subtle, micro-invalidations erase, negate or nullify the experiences of people of color.\nWhat lies at the heart of most micro-invalidations is the norm of whiteness and white experiences. Dismissing the justifiable anger and frustration of people of color is a dismissal of our realities \u2014 a way to ignore the reality of white privilege and white supremacy. A way to make sure that nothing changes.\nFor many white people, being accused of racism is an affront to their view of themselves as fair, liberal, and spiritual individuals. It\u2019s shocking to be told they have biases, and that their biases have harmed people of color. Sometimes engaging with them morphs into yet another defense of white fragility.\nThe beneficiaries of racism spend more time centering how they feel and how uncomfortable the conversation makes them \u2014 instead how much damage has been done to people of color, and how to stop it.\nHow I personally deal with microaggressions depends whether I think the white person is interested in changing their behavior, or whether I just need to enforce my boundaries.\nI asked Rhys, for example, why he thought an \u201cItalian\u201d complexion was something I should take as a compliment. \u201cWhy isn\u2019t my particular shade blackness good enough?\u201d He stumbled a bit, confused. He\u2019d only meant that he found me attractive. Attractive, to him, defaulted to a white norm. I watched his face while the new idea tumbled around in his brain.\nThen I ordered an obscenely expensive cognac.

The thought of a white woman who was born and raised in Apartheid South Africa, adopting a black boy to then raise and dress him up as a girl is sickening.\nWhere are all of the angry black women and mothers who are pistol ready anytime the #MeToo movement rattles their cages against a black man? There is no way that Charlize should not be feeling the wrath of Black America for this clear case of child abuse. Charlize has been dressing this boy like a girl for years now, and it\u2019s nothing more than white liberals brainwashing and socially engineering at play.\nWhat does it take for us to realize the sickness of Hollyweird, white liberals, their New World Order agendas, and their overall push to emasculate black men? It was no coincidence that the first \u201cBlack\u201d president of USA was used to promote and push LGBTQ over all else. The Obama Administration spent over $700 million dollars pushing LGBTQ to African nations. It was no coincidence that black and gay Michael Sams was used to push LGBTQ agendas in the NFL, Sams is now saying that he was used by the LGBTQ at large. Also note that Michael Sams said after coming out that he faced more racism within the white LGBTQ community than he did homophobia within the black community. It was no coincidence that black and gay Jason Collins was used to push LGBTQ agendas in the NBA, and it\u2019s absolutely disgusting and no coincidence that a once prestigious \u201call\u201d black male Morehouse College, is being used to promote and be the face of transgenders. What\u2019s even more laughable and insulting about this revelation, is if a transgender male is saying he\u2019s transitioning into a woman, then why would he/she be attending an all male school...not to mention that Morehouse has also stated that if the person completely transitions while at school they will be immediately asked to leave. This has got to be the dumbest shit I\u2019ve ever heard, but then again this is what happens when white liberals control our institutions.\nI\u2019m sure in the image below that as a child Jackson was demanding to do something that as an adult she pushed against, yet Charlize has the audacity to claim that she takes the word of a 3 year old on what his sexuality is (notice the ballerina slippers he\u2019s wearing in the below photo as well, I\u2019m sure he doesn\u2019t have a credit card and does his own clothes shopping). A three year old can barely string words together to make a coherent sentence, let alone intelligently tell you what their gender makeup is.\nThis is nothing more than white liberals and Hollyweird using black babies as the latest accessory, and transgender/gay as their new social trend and attention grabbing scheme to further push the emasculation of black males. It\u2019s also sickening that many of the pictures that you see of those children, all seem to be of them dressed as though they come from abject poverty instead of the home of a millionaire celebrity. The same could be said of the many images of Madonna and her adoptive black children, they all look as though they\u2019re dressed from a scene in \u201cFlowers In The Attic\u201d, a movie where siblings were being abused and locked away in their families attic for years before finally escaping.\nMainstream media was all in awe when a black boy by the name of Devonte Hart embraced a Portland, OR police office with actual tears flowing down his face (during a 2014 Ferguson protest). The media quickly labeled it as a heartwarming and touching, yet the reality was that this child was holding on for dear life and literally crying out for help...while living in a house of horrors. Devonte and his five siblings were later murdered by their adopted white lesbian mothers, in an apparent murder suicide.\nThere were all types of signs that these two white women were abusing their adoptive \u201cnon-white\u201d kids and no one, not even child services did a damn thing until it was too late.\nThe silencing of black twitter, black Hollywood and mainstream media on the reality of what Charlize Theron is doing to her adopted black son, is no different than the silence of these same people, on Ed Bucks murdering of two black gay men. These people are all owned and controlled by white liberals and are only allowed to speak, march and protest on issues that they give them a pass to do so. All one has to do is a quick hashtag search on Charlize Theron\u2019s name and you will see that the only people who are talking about Theron are mostly right wingers attacking her and white liberals who are praising her for being such a wonderful mother.\nNewsflash: Just because right wingers talk against something that we all know they\u2019re right on, does not mean that we as black people have to be silent, no different than how shocking and pathetic it has been watching black twitter fall in line with white liberals to defend the racist FBI just because Trump came out against them. I\u2019m still waiting on #BLM to demand that they rename the FBI building, since token symbolism is all they seem to fight for.\nIn the above images, Jackson appears to be dressed as a boy on the left, and then as a girl on the right; this is clear child abuse. Charlize needs to be investigated by child services, and those children should also be immediately removed from her home. We would not allow this if it were Laura Ingram or some right winger making these outrageous claims, so why are we willing to allow this now? What more has to be exposed and/or occur for people to stop this atrocity? Does Jackson and his sister have to be murdered like the Hart\u2019s before people say there were signs we just didn\u2019t realize it until it was too late? Surely we can not be this brainwashed and controlled by white liberals agendas, that we allow this type of mental abuse and child abuse to continue.\nFrom Russia With Love,\nCharlie Peach\ud83c\udf51\n", "link": "https://medium.com/@politicspeach/why-is-blacktwitter-silent-on-apartheid-charlize-therons-castration-of-her-adopted-black-son-2b52e80ab652", "author": "CharliePeach\ud83c\udf51", "comments": ["This is absolutely disgusting.

Let me be clear that I do not know the right answers to any of this. There are anti-racist activists in the trenches, much more qualified than I am, that you should listen to first. These individuals are the ones who are constantly risking their lives and reputations to fight white supremacy. I am new to this space and do not have a track record of actually doing anything. Sure, I\u2019ve read some books and am collaborating with people of color, but I haven\u2019t helped organize marches, organize sit-ins in the halls of Congress, or stood on the front lines and faced the threat of actual police violence.\n** Debby Irving, a white anti-racist with much more credibility than I have, said: \u201cMy waking-up process has been largely due to the fact that for 400 years people of color have risked lives, jobs, and reputations in an effort to convey the experience of racism.\u201d I agree completely. So, this is my way of saying to readers to not trust anything I say until my actions reflect my words. I\u2019ve got more work to do than writing a blog post saying \u201clook at me! I\u2019m awake now.\u201d **\n\u2014\nOne question has consumed me recently: \u201cwhat is the role of a white person in conversations about racial justice (especially a white, cisgender, heterosexual, non-disabled, upper middle class male who is a U.S. citizen)?\u201d\nI used to think that the appropriate role for a white male of my status and privilege was to stay out of conversations about race. I believed that the best thing I could do was to keep my mouth shut and make space for others.\nHowever, after learning from anti-racist leaders like Dr. Tiffany Jana, Debby Irving, Robin DiAngelo, Chris Crass, Ijeoma Oluo, Patrisse Khan-Cullors, Nwamaka Agbo, and more, I have realized that white people staying out of conversations about race is not the right answer. It should not be the burden of people of color to educate white people about systemic racism, equity, privilege, and structural oppression.\nSo, my fellow white people, let\u2019s talk about white supremacy \u2014 a system that we (i.e., the people reading this article) did not invent, but that we inherited and continue to benefit from, regardless of whether we believe we are \u201cgood,\u201d or \u201cdefinitely not racist,\u201d or \u201cdon\u2019t see skin color,\u201d or \u201cmarched in the sixties.\u201d\nYou may be thinking \u201cOk, I\u2019m fine talking about diversity and inclusion. But \u2018white supremacy\u2019? That seems unnecessarily provocative and offensive.\u201d If you are thinking this, I completely understand. I would have thought the exact same thing a few years ago. Let me explain.\nAs a white person (or for any person, for that matter), the term white supremacy is often jarring and cringe-worthy. It can conjure up images of neo-Nazis and Klu Klux Klan members marching down the street with torches \u2014 leading to feelings such as shame, defensiveness, or anger.\nHowever, I am not proposing we discuss the bigotry of individuals who identify as white supremacists. I want to discuss the system or organizing principle of white supremacy in which white domination of society is seen as the natural order of things.\nFor white people like me, it is important to discuss this system because it goes largely unnoticed and operates by default in the background of our daily lives.\n\u201cUmm,\u201d you may be wondering, \u201chow is this possibly related to me? I don\u2019t see the connection.\u201d It is related because many of the structural systems that we participate in, such as the economy at large, are based upon \u2014 and tightly intertwined with \u2014 the legacy of white supremacy.\nConsider the GI Bill.\nThe GI Bill was enacted after World War II to provide support for returning veterans. Many white people I know love the GI Bill. Both my grandfather on my mom\u2019s side and my grandfather on my dad\u2019s side directly benefited from the free college and low-interest home loans provided to veterans.\nIn fact, the benefits were so helpful that the GI Bill almost single-handedly moved both sides of my family from lower middle class to upper middle class economic status in one generation.\nWhat about returning African-American veterans? Did they benefit as well?\nPerhaps unsurprisingly, the GI Bill\u2019s benefits were not realized across racial lines. Only a very small percentage of returning African-American GIs were able to take advantage of the free education or housing benefits due to systematic discrimination.\nThere were not enough historically black colleges to educate all of the returning veterans, and many other colleges were only willing to accept a small, token amount of African-American applicants.\nIn addition, redlining was a formal, legal, and intentionally designed system that was written into the GI Bill to block subsidized home loans to African-Americans and other marginalized groups.\nMy family accumulated generational wealth that we still benefit from today. Does my family have a certain level of socio-economic status because we \u201cworked harder\u201d than other families? Nope. I can point directly to the racist policies and practices that forever altered my family\u2019s path and continues to provide a level of comfort, status, and privilege that my family enjoys.\nSee African Americans and the GI Bill and Slavery And American Capitalism for just a few examples of how white supremacy continues to affect our everyday lives.\nWhite supremacy implies a number of unspoken norms. It describes the social order in which one kind of person is superior: a white, Anglo, cisgender, christian, heterosexual, wealth-oriented, non-disabled, male.\nPeople who do not fit neatly into each of these categories and want access to power and privilege are often forced to Anglicize their names, hide their sexuality, play up their wealth, act \u201cmale,\u201d and hide their religion.\nThe culture of white supremacy also elevates a certain attitude and approach to life.\nMany of the values I learned and internalized growing up as a young white male included things like, \u201cWork hard. Keep your nose to the grindstone. Be productive. If you see a problem, fix it. You can do anything you want if you just try hard enough. Everyone gets a fair shot. You are responsible for your own success in life. Suck it up and don\u2019t complain. Always be polite. Avoid conflict. Don\u2019t rock the boat. If you don\u2019t have anything nice to say, don\u2019t say it at all.\u201d\nFor years I assumed that the values imparted to me by my family were somehow unique to us. It shocked me to realize that these messages are part of a cultural lineage and belief system that is handed down by white families to their children over many generations.\nThese internalized values play out in subtle and pernicious ways. For example, if a white child sees a poor black child at school, they might think, \u201cwell, maybe their family just needs to work harder,\u201d or \u201cwe should help those poor people who obviously haven\u2019t figured it out and need the assistance of people like me.\u201d\nBased on the narrative that everyone gets a fair chance and working hard is the answer, the white child may assume the black child\u2019s family is solely responsible for the circumstances in which they find themselves.\nIn addition, white children are taught to avoid conflict. \u201cI\u2019m confused why this black child is poor,\u201d the white child might think, \u201cbut I\u2019m not going to ask about it. It seems like a sensitive topic. It must just be the way things are.\u201d\nNothing in the previous example was consciously or purposefully racist on the part of the white child. If anything, the white child thought they could be helpful. The cause of the damaging conclusions is the unexamined belief system \u2014 the default order of things \u2014 that has been passed down to white people and perpetuates institutional bias.\nI have learned that when white people (like me) first get interested in racial justice, we tend to want to \u201cdo\u201d something about it immediately. We want to create a toolkit, or a 5 step action plan, or conduct an 80/20 analysis to determine critical next steps.\nAnti-racist activists have told me to be wary of these impulses, because \u201cbeing productive\u201d and trying to \u201csolve\u201d white supremacy is part of the problem itself. When we seek to solve problems quickly, we tend to skip over the pain, shame, and guilt we feel, and unintentionally recreate the old patterns of dominance and oppression we are trying to dismantle.\nI can only speak about what has been helpful for me in my own process. Taking these with a large grain of salt, here are six things you can \u201cdo\u201d to take the next step:\n1. Learn, Learn, Learn.\nHere are several resources that were shared with me, and that I have found to be particularly helpful in my thinking about white supremacy:\nEvents:\nArticles:\nBooks:\nNext Economy Now Podcasts:\n2. Educate Other White People About White Supremacy.\nAnti-racist educators have helped me understand that most white people have no idea that there is a system of white supremacy that is distinct from the KKK or Nazis. This is very problematic. It means that we think it only applies to \u201cthose bad people\u201d and not us.\nFor example, as a straight white male, it is the privilege of people like me to NOT think about white supremacy. We can mostly ignore it, or expect people of color (or other historically marginalized groups) to figure things out for themselves, or indefinitely kick the conversation down the road without any apparent negative repercussions.\nIt should not be the burden of people of color, women, or other marginalized groups to educate folks with privilege about institutional racism, institutional sexism, and other forms of systemic bias.\n3. Stay Engaged \u2014 Even if it is Super Uncomfortable.\nOne reason privileged people like me avoid this topic is that many of us feel like we don\u2019t know where to start \u2014 even if we are interested in addressing systemic bias.\nAnother reason is that conversations about the abuses caused by white people often bring up feelings of shame, guilt, hopelessness, anger, and sadness.\nI have taken solace in the advice I have received from racial justice educators and social justice activists over the last few years. Their comments have generally followed along the lines of:\n4. Stop Siloing The Conversation.\nThere is no such thing as a conversation about business and/or the economy and a separate conversation about race, privilege, and white supremacy. I have learned that they are the same conversation. Siloing white supremacy into something separate is one of the main barriers we face to creating a more equitable society.\n5. Seek to Dismantle White Supremacy Instead of \u201cHelping Others.\u201d\nUntil recently, I had always believed that the answer to many social and environmental problems was to \u201chelp\u201d historically marginalized groups bring themselves up to par with white communities. I had never considered that challenging and unraveling the norms, assumptions, and culture of white supremacy itself could be part of the solution. Reframing this problem is difficult and uncomfortable because it shifts the focus to me \u2014 where it belongs.\n6. Seek to Understand Your Own White Fragility.\nRobin DiAngelo, author of White Fragility, says that the most common response to giving feedback to a white person about race is outrage, such as \u201chow dare you suggest that I could have said or done something racist!\u201d DiAngelo says that outrage is often followed by righteous indignation about the manner in which the feedback was given.\nFrom her experience facilitating hundreds of trainings on this topic, she has found that there is apparently an unspoken set of rules for how to give white people feedback on racism, which she calls \u201cThe Rules of Engagement.\u201d She has found that the only way to give feedback correctly is not to give it at all. Thus, the first rule is cardinal:\nDiAngelo notes that each of these rules are rooted in white fragility.\nIn sum, anti-racist leaders have helped me understand why it is critical for me and my fellow whites to more explicitly name white supremacy and examine its negative effects. I am beginning to learn that only by naming it, disrupting it, and dismantling it can we successfully create a world that works for the benefit of all life.\nIf you are interested in learning more, I highly recommend checking out the Dismantling White Supremacy Unconference on June 14\u201315 in Oakland, California. You can also sign up for the LIFT Economy newsletter to get tips, advice, and free resources about building the Next Economy.\nI\u2019m curious to hear from readers. What do you think? Does the urgency of naming, disrupting, and dismantling white supremacy resonate with you?\n", "link": "https://medium.com/@ryan_51843/white-people-lets-talk-about-white-supremacy-b4088a2630f3", "author": "Ryan Honeyman", "comments": ["Great stuff!

You know, those people who pretend to have virtues, moral or religious beliefs, principles, etc., they don\u2019t actually possess, especially a person whose actions are contrary to stated beliefs.\nAmerica is littered with bunches of bigots and hypocrites.\nAmericans care about the Notre-Dame Cathedral burning on another continent, but couldn\u2019t care less about the church burnings in the own country by a sheriff officer\u2019s son no less. Americans say they care about houses of worship, as long as they are White ones. Americans should know churches are the some of most segregated places in America, and the worship hours for Christians are the most segregated times of the week. Media coverage this week highlighted how White houses of worship are much more worthy of its attention.\nMost Americans say they believe in the scripture (Matthew 12:31) to love their neighbor more than they love themselves... but what they really mean is they love certain neighbors. As long as the non-preferred neighbors live on the other side of town, doesn\u2019t ask for anything (pull yourself up by the bootstraps). How one looks and where they are from determines how (and if) they\u2019re helped. We don\u2019t feed themselves the same way they feed their families; we don\u2019t treat other children the way they treat our own children and grandchildren, and we don\u2019t love our neighbors within our borders. We tolerate our neighbors. People will fly all the way across the world to buy foreign orphans because it\u2019s easy and cheap, but won\u2019t go through the hassle and red tape to adopt orphans in their own country.\nMost Americans love to tell the world all men are created equal, and all lives matter... except all lives have never mattered. Only the lives of rich people, White people, and the preferred classes matter. I wish America would write a disclaimer for the false advertisement. Immigrants need to know when they come here the words in the Constitution, the Declaration of Independence, and the Bill of Rights are just words on paper and that the American people really do not understand what equality really is. It\u2019s an American dream. Keyword being the dream.\nToo many Americans believe we are free to go where we want to and this is the land of opportunity... except we still have White sections of town, Whites only places of worship, Whites only clubs, Whites only schools, Whites only employers (although they\u2019ll never say it, but just look at the skins of all the employees of certain companies/corporations), governance structures which do not resemble the demographic makeup of the nation and well... I can go on, but I won\u2019t. White people create systems and settings for Whites only, forcing everyone else to isolate and/or segregate themselves. Nothing snatches opportunity like exclusion and segregation. America loves freedom, but loves dictating who has access to it.\nAmericans love to say they love their military... but they fail year after year to end wars which destroy their mental health. Americans continue to vote for the same war mongers who extend wars to stroke their industrial war complex egos, with no regard for the health and well-being of the people they put out on the front lines and their loved ones. Americans will have a parade for soldiers coming home, but won\u2019t make certain they have the resources they need to assimilate back into our societies after being asked to turn themselves into killing machines. They also won\u2019t hold accountable the politicians who do not make our military live up to all its promises. Americans love to make messes of people\u2019s lives. We hate cleaning them up.\nAmericans love to say they love this country, but they keep voting for assholes who want nothing more than to burn it to the ground. We won\u2019t do anything except sit our lazy asses in front of the television and watch rich pundits give us their opinions regarding what we need to feel better and what our lots in life should be. We don\u2019t want to get dirty. Heaven knows not too many White folks are up for duke\u2019n it out with our government for equality, fairness, and freedom. White people won\u2019t put their lives on the line for much of anything \u2014 except their own comfort. Fighting is for other barbaric people, not Americans.\nMeanwhile... America is on fire; much like the rest of the world if you watch Al Jazeera or BBC for a few hours. People are fighting for their lives everywhere, primarily where Black and Brown people live though. The vestiges of colonialism are still reeking havoc on many of these nations. The disenchanted and distressed people in these places are tired, and they have nothing to lose. These disgruntled citizens love their countries, but they aren\u2019t afraid to do something about their governments when they mistreat them, to include dying fighting for change. People around the world are fighting for their lives or fleeing corruption, poverty, inequality, and injustice globally.\nJust look at Sudan, the Gaza Strip/Palestine, Venezuela, France, Yemen, and Colombia to name a few nations. People are fed up, and they have nothing else to lose. A constant violation of our personal spaces or rights always comes before the battle. The discomfort is the motivator. A fight must happen before any change can ever occur. Change is hard, and those in power hate change, especially when it doesn\u2019t benefit them.\nAmericans aren\u2019t tired yet. We can\u2019t come together in this nation for anything. Not even to fight to save it!\nAmericans have no problem destroying other nations with war, but they want no one coming here to start shit on their own soil, keeping their pristine little places intact. It\u2019s like that in most nations run by White/Anglo/European people. Well, guess what? America is at war and too many of us don\u2019t even know it. By the time most Americans figure it out, it will be too late. Because Americans are such hypocrites, our enemies have found new ways to go to war with us. It was easy too because we\u2019re so lazy. We\u2019re unwilling to fight for anything. We\u2019re too \u201ccivil.\u201d And we suffer from groupthink. Common sense isn\u2019t common anymore. When you take a good, hard look at Americans, we really don\u2018t stand for much, and when we do \u2014 we do not stand together in unity as a nation. It\u2019s easy to divide and conquer us because we\u2019ve always been divided.\nAmericans love telling other nations how to do democracy... except America, still a baby nation, hasn\u2019t perfected the governance style itself. It\u2019s like cheaters telling someone how to be honest.\nAmerica is a hypocrite nation, full of hypocrites. We hate being called out for it. And just because we do, doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s not true. The world is tired of us. It\u2019s the reason young men have no problem running planes into towers, killing American soldiers, kidnapping American tourists, or using our own biases and flaws against us. America has high moral, ethical, and social standards we claim we hold true \u2014 standards we\u2019re unable to achieve ourselves.\nWe are a nation of hypocrites. We need to inspect ourselves and learn to sweep around our own front doors before destroying another nation or person with our hypocrisy. America is an imposter and a pretender. America is sanctimonious, and deceptive. Everyday America exists, she contradicts the values she espouses.\nWe the people are America... and we are all hypocrites.\nIf we Americans don\u2019t want to be seen as hypocrites by our fellow Americans and by the world, we know what we need to do. It\u2019s time we Americans stopped religiously sharing our fake virtues and keep it real with one another, and the world. We\u2019re not fooling anyone \u2014 except ourselves.\nPeople hate hypocrites. I know I sure do.\n\u00a92019 Marley K. All rights reserved.

But the police violently arrested and maliciously coerced five other teenagers to confess to the attack and rape. Despite no DNA evidence and inconsistent confessions that can only come from coercion, a jury convicted the teens.\nThe five teenagers at the time \u2014 Antron McCray, Kevin Richardson, Yusef Salaam, Raymond Santana Jr., and Korey Wise \u2014 had their names recklessly ruined. Unlike Nick Sandmann of Covington High School, the Central Park Five didn\u2019t have a powerful PR team to rebuke the media and change the narrative.\nInstead, the Central Park Five had their years snatched forever. The sentences for Richardson and Wise came from a court in January 1991. And the sentences for McCray, Salaam, and Santana came from a court on September 11, 1990.\nWe should always remember that individuals and communities had their own personal 9/11 before and after America\u2019s 9/11. Individuals and communities still have them, and those tragic days come from terrorists too.\nTrump isn\u2019t just a bully, he\u2019s a terrorist. He\u2019s not just rude, he\u2019s a terrorist. He\u2019s an advocate and practitioner of terror for coercion. I\u2019m not the first to say it, and it\u2019s not an exaggeration.\nDonald Trump racistly terrorized the Central Park Five. In a 2016 interview with Mother Jones, Yusef Salaam said Trump was \u201cthe fire starter\u201d who manipulated people into believing they were guilty which led to more death threats.\nDonald Trump is a white mob boss. Before his rally cry of \u201cLock Her Up\u201d and \u201cLock Them Up,\u201d Trump wanted to cage and kill five teenagers. After their arrests, Trump gave reporters this sound bite \u2014 \u201cMaybe hate is what we need if we\u2019re going to get something done.\u201d\nIt\u2019s no surprise, Trump did something hateful. He spent $85,000 on large ads in four New York City newspapers demanding the death penalty and the return of the police in force. What Trump spent on attack ads was way more than the Central Park Five had for their bail and defense.\nDoes anyone believe the person who robbed his foundation also spent $85,000 out of the goodness of his heart? Trump invests in the demonization of Black and Brown people.\nEvery word in the title is Trump\u2019s MAGA campaign. His double \u201cBring Back\u201d is a call to the past. \u201cThe Death Penalty\u201d is a call for mob violence that targets Black and Brown people. And \u201cOur Police\u201d are the words of someone who knows law enforcement is their possession and expects their pledges of loyalty.\nThe ad ran on May 1, 1989. Mayday, May Day. Was the date a harbinger of how Trump would send distress signals and cry wolf to the white working class?\nFor certain, it was a racist rush to judgment with no concern for responsibility. The racism of white victimhood prompted the ad. And it played to the white racism of white New Yorkers.\nTrump claimed he received 15,000 letters of support in a week and a half for his ad with only a few negative letters. He told Larry King he had 90% of the public\u2019s support.\nBoth now and then, Trump is a proven liar. But there\u2019s no doubt he spoke and wrote for the masses of white New Yorkers. With the Central Park Five, Donald Trump honed his racist message for the white public he would later use in his presidential campaign.\nWe can\u2019t forget that the Central Park Five are four Black men, one of whom is Muslim, and one Hispanic man of Afro-Puerto Rican heritage. They represent the same groups Trump used and abused to build his racist and xenophobic presidential campaign.\nToday, Trump supporters are the white New Yorkers of 1989; the white media is running Trump\u2019s attack ads, and Trump has labeled Mexico, Central America, and Muslims the Central Park Five.\nEvery time Trump calls a human being an animal \u2014 he\u2019s reciting white America\u2019s racist language for Black people and specifically for the Central Park Five.\nEvery time Trump selectively gets outraged over a terror attack by a Brown person \u2014 it\u2019s the same double standard of selective outrage in his ad against the Central Park Five.\nEvery time Trump insists on lies about Muslims and Brown immigrants \u2014 it\u2019s the same refusal to see the evidence, and it\u2019s the racist fearmongering he used against the Central Park Five.\nIn 2002, a judge exonerated the Central Park Five. Trump still says they\u2019re guilty, and he\u2019s never apologized. He\u2019s a man who calls a semblance of justice a disgrace, and an obvious injustice a semblance of justice.\nThe man who cried over Brett Kavanaugh and the dangerous time in America for men is the man who can\u2019t say he was wrong about the Central Park Five.\nThe man who doesn\u2019t believe in the DNA exoneration of the Central Park Five believes in his total exoneration in the Mueller Report.\nThe same person with the power to pardon is the same person who tried to kill innocent kids in 1989.\nAnd the same person who was hateful and angry about the attack and rape of Trisha Meili is the same person we heard bragging about his sexual assaults on women.\nDonald Trump has at least 23 sexual assault allegations pinned to him going back to the 1970s. In the same year Trump took out his ad against the Central Park Five, his wife Ivana accused him of violence and rape.\nThe hate and hypocrisy, which add up to racism and other forms of oppression, are central to Trump and his MAGA mantra.\nIn a 2012 documentary about the Central Park Five, Korey Wise says he can never forget what happened to him. We shouldn\u2019t either. We must remember all the victims and all the villains. The question is, what do we do with our memories?\nI suggest we never lose them and we always use them.

There\u2019s also some evidence depressed and sad people will use social media more, as if to correct something in their lives, and it can backfire terribly.\nIn this sense all those articles saying social media is the next smoking, are kind of right. Social media depersonalizes connection, and some people substitute it for real connection, and guess what, that\u2019s not actually healthy or a good choice to make.\nWhen apps were socially engineered to hack us, to make us replace real connection with digital dopamine, something went terribly wrong in the history of social media. It\u2019s hard to pinpoint when this occurred, but likely somewhere around 2016.\nThe algorithms were designed to make people spend more time on those sites. Interestingly, unhappy people spend more time on social sites. Is unhappiness the cause, or the result of algorithms surfacing content to make us unhappy?\u201d\nThat\u2019s worth pondering and realizing, that social media has failed due to too aggressive a design. That digital dopamine creates such an infatuation that the entire relationship with such platforms becomes like a bad relationship.\nThat\u2019s typically when we find ourselves quitting Facebook, quitting Twitter, quitting Reddit, or any other social media app. We break up with social media apps, because we realize they are taking more from us than they give. We evolve, we outgrowth them, but they stay the same.\nNew research reveals how social media platforms like Facebook can greatly affect your mental health. That empty feeling from overuse of Instagram, Facebook or any other social platform demonstrates how apps fill a void imperfectly, and can actually make us feel deeply more lonely. And, that\u2019s a problem for advertising fueled social platforms. The mental health sacrifice is too large, it doesn\u2019t sustain healthy user retention.\nPlacing advertising at the center of the internet, simply isn\u2019t viable in the long-term.\nIn Asia you can find many useful things on apps such as WeChat, Meituan or Grab, Alibaba and so many other apps. However in the west on social media platforms like Instagram, Facebook or Twitter, that's simply not the case.\nFrom information overload, to social comparison, or trolling on Reddit, we just get burnt out, it\u2019s not a useful experience. You can\u2019t do as much with it, there\u2019s limited online to offline utility.\nSocial media in the West failed to become super apps, they didn\u2019t evolve mini-programs, they just stagnated in hijacking attention. There\u2019s a ceiling when you harvest data and make apps as addictive as possible. Those apps they didn\u2019t allow us to connect to businesses or utility like convenience, they only hacked our attention, which amounts to a fraudulent or poor design for people and for social good.\nThe true programming beneath the western social media apps just seems to be algorithms at the service of advertising. This is especially evident on Microsoft\u2019s LinkedIn, where Ads noticeably litter the feed like spam. It makes you wonder what being a \u201cprofessional network\u201d truly means after all, the Ads themselves are businesses trying to lure other businesses, totally irrelevant to 99.999% of users. Somewhere along the line, advertising broke social media.\nIn 2019 we are seeing a pivot of the entire internet to subscriptions, paywalls, private walled gardens, even stablecoins. Is a celebrity I like to follow on Instagram going to change that for me? It\u2019s an irreversible trend. The social media experiment of Snapchat, Twitter and even Instagram has failed for the most part. It\u2019s repetitive and stale, and it doesn\u2019t have a future. Stories, chat apps and mini-programs have a future, but not social media as we used to know it.\nStudies have linked the use of social media to depression, anxiety, poorer sleep quality, lower self-esteem, inattention, and hyperactivity \u2014 often in teens and adolescents. China\u2019s Bytedance have used the private info of children without their consent. Facebook has seen scandals rock trust in their platform of apps. What kind of a family of apps after all, abuses you like Facebook has our personal data?\nNo, social media apps aren\u2019t just the new smoking. Social media platforms have actually failed and private ecosystem are all that we have left. Consumers have been moving away from personal sharing on open platforms to video entertainment for quite some time.\nAway from Facebook and towards Netflix and YouTube. YouTube after all has some semblance of education, and Netflix demonstrates how streaming is replacing TV and social media with more original content and less privacy invasion.\nSocial media has failed, we just don\u2019t like to admit it. Facebook\u2019s business model is in trouble, and that\u2019s why they are joining Apple in moving to a more walled garden approach to messaging, privacy, connection and advertising in a unified encrypted messaging context.\nWhat the social platforms built has started to crumble, young people don\u2019t care anymore about them. Social media is now recognized as a toxic place. We\u2019re moving on now.\nIn 2019 we\u2019re breaking up with apps that don\u2019t treat us right. Our mental health and sleep are more important. Meanwhile Apple, Facebook, Amazon and Google are building walled garden ecosystems to lure us into their unique world of value, but it won\u2019t feel like social media anymore.\nIt will be more like entertainment ecosystems where there will be a price. Our time, data and attention is all bought and sold on the internet, we aren\u2019t as naive as before.\n", "link": "https://medium.com/futuresin/social-media-has-failed-b5a7ba60ec50", "author": "Michael K.

In most of developing countries the planners are planning town and societies just looking to the standards and the worst thing is that they prefer their policies which are not fulfilling the need of the people.\nPlanning with inflexible Standards\nIs it right to plan a society with rigid standards? Whether we should prefer these typical standards over need? If we take an example of Pakistan, planners are making more than 100 of society every year but still we haven\u2019t seen society which is ecological or providing them all the facilities with in that particular Housing Scheme. None of the housing Scheme have shop of cobbler, butcher, Vegetable, Barber shops etc. Therefore these societies are not able to provide suitable accommodation for such entities. Following the standards raises the prices too much due to which small industries can\u2019t afford to start their business in housing Scheme. The people have to go out to fulfill their necessities.\nPlanning according to needs\nAre we really planning societies according to the needs? Do we consult people whom we are planning? (No). Actually when we are making Plans we are too much bounded and at that time planners are not preferring needs. As we all know \u201cPlanning is for the people, by the people and with the people\u201d.

Have you already heard about reactive programming? RxDart is a reactive functional programming library for Dart language, based on ReactiveX. Dart already has a decent package to work with Streams, but RxDart comes to adds functionality on top of it. But now you might be asking, what\u2019s Stream?\nStreams represent flux of data and events, and what it\u2019s important for? With Streams, you can listen to data and event changes, and just as well, deal with what\u2019s coming from the Stream with listeners. How it can be applied to Flutter? For example, we have a Widget in Flutter called StreamBuilder that builds itself based on the latest snapshot of interaction with a Stream, and when there\u2019s a new flux of data the Widget reload to deal with the new data. Widget Weekly of Flutter Dev Channel offers great content about how the StreamBuilder works. And about Sinks? If we have an output of a data flux, we also need an input, that\u2019s what Sinks is used for, seems simple right? Now let\u2019s see about the BLoC pattern and how can we combine both concepts into a great Flutter app.\nThe BLoC(Bussiness Logic Component) Pattern was announced officially by Paolo Soares in the Dart Conference 2018. If you saw the announcement video, probably you realized that the initial proposal was to reuse the code related to the business logic in other platforms, in this case, Angular Dart. Shortly what the pattern seeks for, is take all business logic code off the UI, and using it only in the BLoC classes. It brings to the project and code, independence of environment and platform, besides put the responsibilities in the correct component. And now our talk will make much more sense, because BLoC Pattern only relies on the use of Streams.\nLooking at the image above, we can realize the flux. The Widgets send data/event to the BLoC class through Sink and are notified by Stream. See that there\u2019s no business logic in the widget, that means what happened in BLoC is not the concern of UI. This architecture improves even easier tests, in which the business logic tests cases needed to be applied only to the BLoC classes.\nRxDart is now (at the moment of this post) in the version 0.21.0. And here I\u2019m going to talk about some objects that the library brings to us.\nObservable allow us to send a notification to Widgets which is observing it and then deal with the flux of data. Observable class in RxDart extends from Stream, which implies in some great things:\nThis one is pretty simple. This Subject allows sending data, error and done events to the listener. Here it will work with Sinks, which we were talking about before. See the example above:\nThis one is similar to the PublishSubject. It also allows sending data, error and done events to the listener, but the latest item that has been added to the subject will be sent to any new listeners of the subject. But don\u2019t you worry, after that, any new events will be appropriately sent to the listeners. See the example above:\nThe ReplaySubject allow us the same: sending data, error and done events to the listener. But with a crucial difference here. As items are added to the subject, the ReplaySubject will store them and when the stream is listened to, those recorded items will be emitted to the listener. See the example above:\nIn this article I will show to you a simple example of using RxDart and principles of BLoC pattern. Let\u2019s start it.\nA great way to start it, is from the beginning: Flutter Hello World. Probably you are familiarized with the increment function on the app, but to make more let\u2019s create the decrement function as well. So first of all, create a flutter project and import rxdart to your project. Let\u2019s code:\nAs you can see, this code implements the increment and decrement function, but still doesn\u2019t apply the BLoC pattern or even Streams. This code works and it\u2019s pretty simple, but if you took attention you\u2019ll see that we have two logic business function in the UI code: increment and decrement. So imagine if this app was a big app that you was working hard, but now the requirement has been changed and the increment needs to add two at time. Do you agree with me (that in this case) a requirement changing in the business logic shouldn\u2019t affect UI code, right? If yes, great! You got it, that is the point to separate responsibilities.\nNow let\u2019s separate it and use what we have learned so far. Let\u2019s create our CounterBloc class:\nGreat! Now let me explain the code above. We created a class called CounterBloc which imports the rxdart library. In this case, we need to receive the initialCount, that allow us to know from which number our counter should begin. I choose for this example the BehaviorSubeject, and then I initialized the Subject with the data passed by parameter, in other words, when the Widget become a listener of the Subject the first value passed through the stream will be the initialCount which was set in the CounterBloc constructor. Now let\u2019s talk about the methods. In this case, we have four methods in the class:\nNow that we have the BLoC class created let\u2019s see integrating it with the UI.\nWe changed some few things in the UI:\nAt this moment our well-structured app will look like this:\nThat\u2019s it, guys. There\u2019s a lot of alternatives to structure your Flutter app and patterns to help with state management like BLoC, Redux, ScopedModel, and others. I confess BLoC is my favorite, but tell me if you liked it too. Thank you for reading the article so far, and please let your feedback.

Now I\u2019m not so sure.\nMy first cell phones were of the flip variety. You might even call them folding phones. They usually hid a keyboard and 2.3-inch screen inside a clamshell design. Some of them had a second, tiny screen on the outside that often showed me the caller\u2019s number. These were good phones, until something better came along.\nI\u2019m now perfectly content with my single-screen slab phone, which offers a large, rigid display and ample power. Why would I want to backslide to the folding era?\nAfter spending some time with the first viable folding screen smartphone, Samsung\u2019s Galaxy Fold ($1,980), I\u2019m open to rethinking my stance.\nSamsung\u2019s dual screen device surprised me. Folded, it\u2019s much narrower than I anticipated, which makes the external 4.6-inch dynamic AMOLED screen (720x1680) operational with just one hand. I found that I could easily reach from edge to edge and from top to bottom of the small screen \u2014 granted, though, I have large hands and long fingers).\nOn the back is virtually the same triple-camera configuration (16MP ultra-wide camera, 12MP wide-angle camera, and a 12MP telephoto camera) as you\u2019ll find on the Samsung Galaxy S10+. On the inside, carved out of a small, somewhat trapezoidal space in the upper right-hand corner, is a 10 MP selfie camera and an 8MP depth camera. I didn\u2019t have enough time to test all these lenses, but I think it\u2019s safe to assume they\u2019ll perform similarly to those on the S10+.\nAt 263 grams, the Galaxy Fold is heavier than the 6.4-inch Galaxy S10+ (175 grams), but it doesn\u2019t feel like a brick. Folded and unfolded, it is surprisingly comfortable to hold. Obviously, the Galaxy Fold is roughly twice as thick as say, a Galaxy S10, but that\u2019s what happens when you essentially fold a full-thickness phone in half.\nIf you were hoping for a phone that folds its flexible display perfectly flat, the Galaxy Fold will disappoint you. There is a small gap at the hinge to accommodate a tiny flexible screen curve. I can live with it since I know there\u2019s no way Samsung could make a folding screen capable of sustaining 200,000 folds with a sharply folded edge in the middle.\nSamsung\u2019s hinge mechanism is an impressive piece of engineering and branding. When folded, the Galaxy Fold\u2019s half-inch thick, chrome hinge is wide enough to accommodate the word \u201cSamsung.\u201d Unfolded, the hinge somehow slips away inside the body, allowing the front and back of the fold to meet neatly in the middle.\nI was able to unfold the phone with one hand, which revealed the 7.3-inch (2152x1536), tablet-sized display. Unlike the screen on the outside, there\u2019s no glass on this flexible, dynamic AMOLED screen. Samsung developed a special polymer for the display, which apparently needs a raised bezel running around the edge to hold it in place. If you\u2019re accustomed to phone and tablet displays with perfectly flat bezels, this might throw you a little bit, but I almost didn\u2019t notice it was there. Overall, the display looks fantastic, but from certain angles I could discern (and feel) the slightest wave in the center of the display. It did not impact how anything looked on the screen.\nAs much as I liked the large Android display, it\u2019s not the reason, at least alone, that I think the Galaxy Fold has some potential.\nWhat impressed me most in my relatively brief time with the device is how Samsung made two screens into one continuous system. The Galaxy Fold is a $1,980 two-for-one-device that also manages to combine the two distinct screens into one cohesive system.\nApp activities like maps that you start on the smaller 4.6-inch screen automatically appear on the larger screen as soon as you unfold the phone. And if you adjust the settings, you can have apps start on the large screen and continue to the smaller one when you fold the phone. As I did this a few times, primarily with Google Maps, I marveled at the smooth transition between screens. It\u2019s a little like those old folded maps we kept in our glove compartments. The small screen is when you have just a small portion of the folded map showing and the large screen is when you unfurl the map, but without all the fuss of trying manage all that giant, unwieldy paper.\nOf course, if you hand me a big screen, I expect tablet functionality. I watched as a Samsung rep showed me how to separate the screen into three separate apps (chrome, calendar and maps), and then added a handful of additional app windows (up to five) that I could drag freely around the screen.\nWith the device folded, I launched the rear camera, using the 4.6-inch screen as a viewfinder. Then I unfolded the phone and it automatically switched the viewfinder to the 7.3-inch display. I didn\u2019t even have to reorient the screen and device.\nYou do not have to unfold Galaxy Fold to use it. The external display functions as a complete touch-screen Android smartphone. Yes, the screen is small and narrow, but how much screen real estate do you need for email, texts, and scanning social media?\nI examined the gold edges of the Galaxy Fold, noting the lack of a 3.5 mm headphone jack (it ships with Galaxy Buds), and existence of the fingerprint-reader/Bixby combo button. I hit that button more than a few times, accidentally launching Bixby, which I immediately exited. The phone even ships with a nifty two-piece Galaxy Fold case.\nSamsung promises that the unusual dual-battery configuration (they split the battery between the two chassis halves) provides all-day battery life, but, for now, I have no way of testing their claims. It also supports wireless charging and Wireless PowerShare. Inside the phone is a 7nm 64-bit octa-core Processor. Sorry, but there wasn\u2019t time to run benchmark tests or, this being an international model, test out network connectivity.\nAs I placed the Samsung Galaxy Fold back in its box, I realized that I could no longer dismiss the folding phone concept as both retrograde and a desperate cry for attention. This felt, instead, like a third way: there\u2019s the slab, the old-school flip, and this new path: two screens, one purpose and, maybe, all the flexibility you need.\n", "link": "https://onezero.medium.com/samsungs-galaxy-fold-is-a-new-path-forward-for-smartphones-9e07eca93852", "author": "Lance Ulanoff", "comments": ["I\u2019ll wait until the tech matures a bit.My Samsung Galaxy Fold screen broke after just a dayAlthough it's only been in our hands for a couple of days, something broke on Samsung's top-flight, $1,980 folding\u2026www.theverge.com", "Apparently the early samples given to influencers etc just a week before the official launch are starting to fail within 2 days\u200a\u2014\u200abroken folds, blacked out hinges etc\u200a\u2014\u200aguess they will have to delay otherwise it\u2019ll be like the one that had the battery issue which died an near instant death market-wise.", "I really like the idea of the Galaxy Fold.

However, animations & transitions can really be a pain to implement in Android.\nIn this article, I will share with you my feelings about the implementation of this animation between two screens, called in Material Design a \u201cHierarchical transition\u201d :\nResources:\nFirst, in order to implement this transition, I needed to know about some concepts :\nThe first thing I needed to do was to identify what will be the View shared through the two screens (so I can animate them properly during the transition) :\nI identified 4 View that will be shared between the two screens :\nThen, I set for each of those views, a unique transitionName value:\nFinally, I had to tell Android that, when it will launch the Intent of the second screen, it must know and care about those shared elements :\nEdit: In order to handle this issue (on some devices, the navigation bar is blinking when the transition starts), I created this convenient method that I use instead of ActivityOptionsCompat.makeSceneTransitionAnimation :\nWell, this part is pretty simple because I had to identify which icons are animated. In our example, we have 4 icons animated :\nGreat, the 4 animated icons were spotted! \ud83d\udd0d\nNow, I had to convert each icon (PNG format) into an Animated Vector Drawable (XML format). In order to realize that, I used the awesome tool created by Alex Lockwood called Shape Shifter.\nAll the AVD I created for this example are located in the project into the resource folder drawable-v21. You are totally free to reuse it in your own projects.\nOnce the AVD were created, I had to animate all the thing together through some transitions.\nThat\u2019s the most interesting part. First, it\u2019s important to differentiate two kinds of transition :\nAs you can see in this style, I set the two kinds of Transition with the XML properties :\nFor example, let\u2019s take a look at the activity_detail_s_e_enter.xml transitions file :\nAs you can see, this transitions file is responsible for declaring and triggering some transitions on our 4 Shared Elements that I defined earlier :\nHowever, you have may notice that both FabAnimatableTransition and BottomAppBarAnimatableTransition are subclasses of BaseForcedTransition.\nI literally spent one day on it and I was finally saved by this SO answer (thanks Jinyan Cao \ud83d\ude4f).\nActually, during a scene transition, the framework will not trigger the createAnimator() (where our AVD are supposed to be started) if the starting and ending states for the transitioning views are the same.\nThat seems legit but not obvious to me.\nWell, that part was tough but instructive.\nNow that the shared elements are properly animated, I had to take a look at the file responsible for declaring and triggering some transitions on the remaining views :\nAs you can see in this file, I have excluded all the shared elements of this transition set and applied those following transitions to the remaining views :\nFinally, I repeated those actions to the two screens to be able to reproduce the desired Material Design \u201cHierarchical Transition\u201d... \u2764\nI really enjoyed playing with the Android Transition framework, especially because I barely had to modify the controllers (fragment/activity): everything can be done through XML files! #KeepOurControllersLight\nDespite the fact that sometimes the transitions can be very long to implement due mainly to the complexity of our layouts and the necessity of perfect synchronization of each one of the animations, I totally approve the necessity to make our apps UX more Material Design.\n", "link": "https://proandroiddev.com/playing-with-material-design-transitions-b3ea90c5794c", "author": "Philippe BOISNEY", "comments": ["Really useful.

Recently I\u2019ve been improving system bar handling in a few apps, enabling them to draw behind the status and navigation bars. I\u2019ve come up with some methods which make handling insets easier.\nFor the rest of this post we will be going through a simple example using a BottomNavigationView, which is laid out at the bottom of the screen. It is very simply implemented as so:\nBy default, your Activity\u2019s content will be laid out within the system provided UI (navigation bar, etc), thus our view sits flush to the navigation bar. Our designer has decided that they would like the app to start drawing behind the navigation bar though. To do that we\u2019ll call setSystemUiVisibility() with the appropriate flags:\nAnd finally we will update our theme so that we have a translucent navigation bar, with dark icons:\nAs you can see, this is only the beginning of what we need to do though. Since the Activity is now laid out behind the navigation bar, our BottomNavigationView is too. This means the user can\u2019t actually click on any of the navigation items. To fix that, we need to handle any WindowInsets which the system dispatches, and use those values to apply appropriate padding to views.\nOne of the usual ways to handle WindowInsets is to add padding to views, so that their contents are not displayed behind the system views. To do that, we can set an OnApplyWindowInsetsListener to add the necessary bottom padding to the view, ensuring that its content isn\u2019t obscured.\nOK great, we\u2019ve now correctly handled the bottom system window inset. But later the designer decided to add some padding in the layout too:\nNote: I\u2019m not recommending using 24dp of vertical padding on a BottomNavigationView, I am using a large value here just to make the effect obvious.\nHmmm, that\u2019s not right. Can you see the problem? Our call to updatePadding() from the OnApplyWindowInsetsListener will now wipe out the intended bottom padding from the layout.\nAha! Lets just add the current padding and the inset together:\nWe now have a new problem. WindowInsets can be dispatched at any time, and multiple times during the lifecycle of a view. This means that our new logic will work great the first time, but for every dispatch we\u2019re going to be adding more and more bottom padding. Not what we want. \ud83e\udd26\nThe solution I\u2019ve come up with is to keep a record of the view\u2019s padding values after inflation, and then refer to those values instead. Example:\nThis works great, and means that we maintain the intention of the padding from the layout, and we still inset the views as required. Keeping object level properties for each padding value is very messy though, we can do better... \ud83e\udd14\nEnter my newdoOnApplyWindowInsets() extension method. This is a wrapper around setOnApplyWindowInsetsListener() which generalises the pattern above:\nWhen we need a view to handle insets, we can now do the following:\nMuch nicer! \ud83d\ude0f\nYou may have noticed the requestApplyInsetsWhenAttached() above. This isn\u2019t strictly necessary, but does work around a limitation in how WindowInsets are dispatched. If a view calls requestApplyInsets() while it is not attached to the view hierarchy, the call is dropped on the floor and ignored.\nThis is a common scenario when you create views in Fragment.onCreateView(). The fix would be to make sure to simply call the method in onStart() instead, or use a listener to request insets once attached. The following extension function handles both cases:\nAt this point we\u2019ve greatly simplified how to handle window insets. We are actually using this functionality in some upcoming apps, including one for an upcoming conference \ud83d\ude09. It still has some downsides though:\nI knew we could do better.\nSo far this entire post has concentrated solely on code, and handling insets through setting listeners. We\u2019re talking about views here though, so in an ideal world we would declare our intention to handle insets in our layout files.\nEnter data binding adapters! If you\u2019ve never used them before, they let us map code to layout attributes (when you use Data Binding). You can read more about them here:\nSo lets create an attribute to do this for us:\nIn our layout we can then simply use our new paddingBottomSystemWindowInsets attribute, which will automatically update with any insets.\nHopefully you can see how ergonomic and easy to use this is compared to using an OnApplyWindowListener alone. \ud83c\udf20\nBut wait, that binding adapter is hardcoded to only set the bottom dimension. What if we need to handle the top inset too? Or the left? Or right? Luckily binding adapters let us generalise the pattern across all dimensions really nicely:\nHere we\u2019ve declared an adapter with multiple attributes, each mapping to the relevant method parameter. One thing to note, is the usage of requireAll = false, meaning that the adapter can handle any combination of the attributes being set. This means that we can do the following for example, setting both the left and bottom:\nEase of use level: \ud83d\udcaf\nYou might have read this post, and thought \u201cWhy hasn\u2019t he mentioned the fitSystemWindows attribute?\u201d. The reason for that is because the functionality that the attribute brings is not usually what we want.\nIf you\u2019re using AppBarLayout, CoordinatorLayout, DrawerLayout and friends, then yes use it. Those views have been built to recognize the attribute, and apply window insets in an opinionated way relevant to those views.\nThe default View implementation of android:fitSystemWindows means to pad every dimension using the insets though, and wouldn\u2019t work for the example above. For more information, see this blog post which is still very relevant:\nPhew, this was a long post! Aside from us making WindowInsets easier to handle, hopefully it has demonstrated how features like extension functions, lambdas, and binding adapters can make any API easier to use.\n", "link": "https://medium.com/androiddevelopers/windowinsets-listeners-to-layouts-8f9ccc8fa4d1", "author": "Chris Banes", "comments": ["Thanks for eventually mentioning android:fitSystemWindows and reminding how it works, thought I was going crazy.", "So why ConstraintLayout won\u2019t pass the insets along?

It is really helpful in debugging your code when debugging by break-point just won't work.\nIt is generally a good practice to place Log statements in your code. These statements help you keep a track of flow control in your application. Similarly, it is not recommended to have log statements in your release ready code, since those log statements can be read by anyone who connects their phone to a PC. So, when releasing your application to the play store, it is recommended to remove all the log statements from your code.\nBut this can be a real pain. There are so many log statements all over your code. Now you have to find each one and remove it from your code for the release version.\nAnother problem with the default logging mechanism is that you need to pass the TAG every time you write a log statement.\nWouldn\u2019t it be wonderful if the log statements would automatically disable themselves when in production? Wouldn\u2019t it be great if the Log statements automatically picked up the TAG/classname while logging and you could just focus on writing better code?\nWell, problems such as these and many more are solved by a better logging library in android, called Timber (by Jake Wharton).\nIt is a light-weight, easy to use library. It takes care of most of the maintenance you need to do while logging so that you can focus more on writing great code and less on the maintenance stuff.\nLet\u2019s go ahead and create a sample application to see how you can include Timber in your android application and make your logging life easier.\nWe will be creating a simple Android application with 4 buttons. Each button would print out different priority log statement on the console.\nCreate a new project in Android and add a dependency for Timber in your app level build.gradle file. At the time of this writing, this is the latest dependency version for timber:\nWith the dependency downloaded, now it\u2019s time to initialize the timber library. The best place to initialize timber is in the Application class which will be active during the entire lifetime of the application. So, let\u2019s create a custom application class and initialize our Timber library in it:\nLet\u2019s now create our MainActivity by adding 4 buttons and setting on click listeners to each of them. Here is my activity_main.xml file. I\u2019m using ConstraintLayout as my root layout and including 4 buttons each for different logging levels.\nNow it\u2019s time to set click listeners to these buttons and print a log statement every time a button is clicked. I\u2019m using kotlin\u2019s synthetic bindings instead of regular findViewById calls or Butterknife. Here is my MainActivity.kt file:\nNotice how we didn\u2019t need to initialize any TAG variable in our class, Timber does it automatically for you.\nNow, this is where Timber really shines. What we\u2019ve done till now was nothing great, just printing the log statements on button clicks. But as you know, logging in production is not a good idea. We will write code to disable the logs for production while keeping them enabled during debug mode.\nWe\u2019ll write an if block to check if our app is in debug mode and enable logging for that. If not, then we want to initialize Timber using a custom tree.\nHere\u2019s the modified MainApplication.kt class:\nAs you can see, we\u2019ve initialized timber using a custom ReleaseTree when in release mode. Now let\u2019s go ahead and create our own release tree.\nCreating a release tree is fairly simple. Create a new Kotlin class and extend it from Timber.Tree. Implement all the abstract functions and you\u2019re good to go.\nHere\u2019s my ReleaseTree.kt:\nAs you can see, whenever there is an error, we can send the log to an online service such as Firebase CrashAnalytics or Crashlytics and not logging out on production.\nLet\u2019s look at some of the benefits of using Timber library instead of the default Log utility by android sdk.\nFor a long time I had ignored the use of log statements and printing out better logs. As my code got bigger and problems got more complex, I realized I needed to adopt better and more efficient debugging routines. Hence, using Timber is one step in the right direction.\nLike what you read?

If you want to have a slide transition like iOS you use CupertinoPageRoute. That\u2019s it, nothing else.\nBut for custom transition Flutter provides different transition widgets. Let\u2019s see how we can use them.\nWe know that Navigator.push takes two arguments (BuildContext context, Route<T> route). We can create our own custom page route with some transition animation. Let\u2019s start with something simple like a slide transition.\nWe will extend the PageRouteBuilder and define the transitionsBuilder which will return SlideTransition widget.

We will use Tween<Offset> to give begin and end offset.\nWe can now use SlideRightRoute instead of MaterialPageRoute like this.\nThe result is...\nPretty easy, isn\u2019t it? You can change the direction of the slide transition by changing the offset.\nScale Transition animates the scale of a transformed widget. You can also change how the animation comes in by changing the curves of CurvedAnimation. In the below example I have used Curves.fastOutSlowIn.\nThe result is...\nRotation transition animates the rotation of a widget. You can also provide transitionDuration to your PageRouteBuilder.\nThe result is...\nThe result is...\nThe result is...\nGreat!! We have seen all the basic transitions.\nNow let\u2019s do something more advance. What if we want to animate both the routes. The entering route(new page) and the exit route(old page). We can use the stack transition animations and apply it to both the routes. one example of this could be the slide in the new route and slide out the old route. This is my favourite transition animation \u2764\ufe0f.

The goal is to serve the right people.\u201d\nHere\u2019s how he describes MVA:\nSeth encourages creators to try to reach \u201calmost no one\u201d.\nDoing so, he assures us, allows us to focus on providing real value to the exact people who actually want to hear from us.\nAnd this is precisely the kind of people with whom you, I, and all other creators should be trying to connect when it comes to building email lists.\nWhen somebody unsubscribes from your list, they\u2019re effectively telling you:\n\u201cI don\u2019t belong in your tribe.\u201d\nAnd that\u2019s perfectly fine because your objective shouldn\u2019t ever be to try to convince the non-believers.\nDoing so is a waste of time.\nInstead, your goal should be to try to serve those who believe, like you, that \u201cpeople like us do things like this.\u201d\nThis is yet another powerful nugget of marketing wisdom from Seth.\nThe basic idea is that, for all intents and purposes, the world can be divided into two groups:\nThe people who are like you, are like you precisely because you share similar experiences, interests, outlooks, and values and you do similar things.\nThe people who aren\u2019t like you, aren\u2019t like you precisely because you don\u2019t share similarities and you don\u2019t do similar things.\nAs a creator, you can fully ignore the people in group 2 \u2014 they\u2019re never going to be a part of your tribe.\nInstead, you should focus all of your energy on those in group 1.\nThe question you have to ask yourself is:\n\u201cWhat do people like me do?\u201d and, by extension, \u201cwhat do people like me care about?\u201d\nI use the following tagline on my newsletter signup form:\n\u201cPractical, experience-based techniques for becoming a better writer, thinker, and creator and a happier and less anxious person.\u201d\nOn the one hand, this message is a bit generic.\nAfter all, every one of us wants to be happier and less anxious, right?\nOn the other, however, this tagline serves to weed out people who aren\u2019t likely to find value in the various things about which I write.\nIt does so by signalling that if you sign up for my newsletter, you\u2019ll receive information and insights into topics like business, marketing, mental health, psychology, personal development, and the art and science of writing.\nI\u2019m not trying to self-promote here.\nRather, I\u2019m trying to emphasize the necessity and value of recognizing that:\nYour ideal audience comprises people who are just like you.\nIf you\u2019re not like me, my writing isn\u2019t for you.\nThat\u2019s merely a fact, not a normative judgment or criticism.\nPeople like me wake up at 4:30am to write a new blog post because their inspiration and drive make it impossible for them not to do it.\nPeople like me care about the meaning of words and are annoyed by grammar mistakes; they strive to express themselves clearly and convincingly when they write.\nPeople like me believe success takes lots of hard work and requires serious discipline; they create opportunities for themselves rather than wait for opportunities to magically drop into their laps.\nPeople like me accept the wisdom of \u2018short-term sacrifice for long-term gain\u2019; they consistently do more work than they\u2019re paid for because they understand the importance of overdelivering to building a solid reputation.\nPeople like me take time to think hard about difficult and interesting philosophical puzzles because they believe the most challenging questions in life are also the most meaningful.\nPeople like me are highly introspective, constantly analyzing themselves in an effort to better understand their strengths and weaknesses so they can become better versions of themselves.\nPeople like me believe they have control over the direction of their lives and so they take action \u2014 big and small \u2014 rather than submit to defeat and hopelessness.\nPeople like me believe in the power of vulnerability and so they share intimate details about their lives with others in the hopes that such stories will positively impact those around them.\nIf you\u2019re not like me then what I create isn\u2019t for you.\nThat\u2019s why I smile every time somebody unsubscribes from my email list.\nWhen that notification pops up in my inbox, I think to myself:\n\u201cMy tribe just got that much tighter!

It was deeply personal, too personal, and it didn\u2019t fit my voice or style at all.\nUsually, Lance, my editor, would respond within a day or two with revisions to my submissions.\nWhen I sent him this piece, I didn\u2019t hear back from him for almost a week.\nWhile I waited, I looked over my post a few times. It was an awful, incoherent stream of consciousness.\nNo wonder he hadn\u2019t replied.\nI wrote him an email suggesting the post wasn\u2019t a good fit for the website.\nI received a reply immediately.\n\u201cYeah. I\u2019m glad you came to the same conclusion.\u201d\nAfter that hiccup, I continued to work with Lance and we developed a great relationship. He helped me learn a crucial lesson early in my writing career.\nI\u2019m in no position to judge anyone else\u2019s writing, but I do see a common mistake among many writers, especially those who want to succeed in online writing.\nPlease, if you ever want anyone to read your work or become a successful writer in the commercial sense, let this next sentence sink deep beneath your skull and into the core of your being:\nYour blog is not your personal journal.\nIf you want to document your personal life online, that\u2019s fine, but don\u2019t expect it to resonate with other people.\nYes, you need to tell stories. Yes, you need to share your personality. But if you make it all about you, nobody will care.\nThe same can be said for the topics you write about. There\u2019s an audience for many types of writing, but don\u2019t be shocked if people aren\u2019t racing to read your underground heavy metal band review blog (this is an actual blog I\u2019ve come across).\nWrite about what you want to write about, but know that certain ways of writing and subjects aren\u2019t as appealing as others.\nYou can be authentic, unique, and sincere, but your writing has to do one of these three things to succeed.\nYour writing isn\u2019t just in competition with other writing, it\u2019s also in competition with \u201cmovies, apps and free high definition pornography,\u201d says bestselling author Ryan Holiday.\nPeople love to be entertained. Life can be mundane, even painful. People need an outlet to escape from time to time. If your writing provides that, people will pay attention.\nTell stories, but tell stories that make people laugh, cry, or both. When you\u2019re done writing, read over your work as an objective viewer.\nWould you be entertained by your writing if you were a stranger? If you\u2019re honest with yourself, you\u2019ll know when the answer is \u201cno.\u201d\n\u201cHow to,\u201d posts are popular for a reason. People like learning new things. If you can help people improve an area of their life they\u2019ll appreciate your work.\nThere\u2019s no need to try to be an expert.\nShare what you know about a certain subject people want to learn about.\nShare \u201cadvice as autobiography,\u201d as James Altucher puts it. Meet people where they are and share what you\u2019ve learned through experience.\nEven if you\u2019re not teaching lessons overtly, you can write in a way that helps people understand something new about themselves.\nThe most popular stories \u2014 from sections of The Bible to The Alchemist \u2014 weave in a lesson or two about life.\nMake your reader a better person for having read your work and they\u2019ll become loyal fans.\nPeople love feeling inspired. Ephemeral as it can be, inspiration lifts people up from their darkness, gives them hope, and every once in a while, leads to true change in their lives.\nYou don\u2019t have to be a \u201crah-rah,\u201d cheerleader, but if you can find a way to lift people up with your words, your readers will come back for more.\nI wasn\u2019t always an author.\nI used to be a drug dealer, a womanizer, and an alcoholic \u2014 not much of a good person at all.\nAt one point I had enough of the depression and darkness and looked for sources of inspiration.\nI started hanging out with more positive people, read inspirational books, listened to TED talks, and the inspiration I drew from these sources helped me become a better person.\nInspiration isn\u2019t a substitute for work.\nI still had to take action, but it started with inspiration.\nWhen used wisely, giving the gift of inspiration helps people change for the better. Find a way to use your experiences to help others make a change in themselves.\nThe pros, the writers we all admire, manage to do all three at once.\nGreat writing is alchemy \u2014 you take bits of entertainment, mix in some education, and add a dash of inspiration, in order to create remarkable work.\nWriters are like chefs. We all have the same ingredients available to us. The ones who set themselves apart master the mixture of these ingredients.\nWith practice, it can be done.\nTinker. Play around with the elements. Repeat the process.\nYou can master the craft of writing. I\u2019m convinced that talent doesn\u2019t mean much when it comes to being successful at anything.\nYou may never become a Hemingway, Vonnegut, Rowling, or R.R Martin, but if you commit to the craft, while also paying attention to your readers, you\u2019ll become a bonafide wordsmith.\nI continue to repeatedly learn the same lesson when it comes to writing:\nYou\u2019ll never be successful until you get out of your own way.\nThe next time you publish something and it falls flat, ask yourself if it contained any of these elements of successful writing. Chances are it doesn\u2019t.\nDon\u2019t fret. Go back to the drawing board. Use these ingredients as your checklist.\nYour favorite writer had to grow into the writer they\u2019ve become.\nYou have to grow, too.

Most you met there, while a few you met before you arrived. You make a comment. People nod enthusiastically, maybe laugh. Some reply. Then the walls surrounding the party crack and tumble away, revealing thousands, even millions of people. You look down and realize you\u2019re wearing a mic. They all heard what you said.\nBuckle up. You\u2019ve gone viral.\nI\u2019ve had two tweets go \u2014 and this is the only way I can describe it \u2014 horribly viral. The first was in November 2017, after the Sutherland Springs shooting. I was extremely upset by the news, furious that politicians with the power to implement gun control laws just \u201csent thoughts and prayers,\u201d using the language of empathy to look noble while doing nothing. So I tweeted to my roughly 2,500 followers:\nIt would be liked 114,000 times and retweeted 46,000 times as of early April.\nThe second time was in March 2019, in response to the news that New Zealand was moving to ban semi-automatic weapons one day after the Christchurch shooting. All I did was retweet the news, with the joke:\nIt being so similar to the first tweet, maybe I should have suspected this one would go viral too \u2014 which it did, with even more likes than the first. What I wouldn\u2019t have suspected is how similar the experiences were.\nSo, if you go viral, I think I can give you an idea of what to expect.\nUp until this point, a good tweet of mine would get maybe 10 likes, perhaps a retweet or two. When my tweet on guns notched up 70 likes, I said, \u201cGosh!\u201d When it reached the high hundreds, I said to myself, \u201cSurely it\u2019ll stop soon.\u201d When it made the thousands, I shivered inside with a feeling I recognized from the times I did theater and stand-up comedy: stage fright. As it broke 100,000, I put my phone away.\nOf course it\u2019s a form of validation \u2014 there\u2019s a reason the like button is shaped like a heart and not a rotten tomato. But the first time the like button on your tweet is pressed by six figures of thumbs, I bet you\u2019ll shiver too.\nWhat counts as having \u201ccontrol\u201d over a tweet? Well, you have the power to delete it, and you can monitor the numbers on it. But by the time a tweet has gone truly viral, it\u2019s too late. I hope you picked a decent profile pic, because you are now a meme.\nYou will see your face plastered all over Reddit, Instagram, and Facebook, courtesy of your excited friends who report the tweet\u2019s whereabouts to you like a team of private investigators you haven\u2019t hired. They\u2019ll send you feverish messages: \u201cYou\u2019re the top post on Reddit!\u201d \u201cJanuary Jones just shared your tweet!\u201d \u201cRuby Rose just shared your tweet!\u201d They\u2019ll probably assume this will delight you, and maybe it will at first. But there\u2019s also fear and dread \u2014 or whatever emotions you associate with an enormous amount of attention over which you have precisely zero control.\nYou\u2019re going to hear from people you know. They\u2019ll get in touch for three reasons:\nStrangers get in touch for three reasons:\nThe strangest element of going viral is people reacting like your tweet was some kind of Jehovah\u2019s Witness\u2013style knock on their door. It\u2019s as if they feel they were minding their own business while you barged into their life with your opinion, when one look at your \u201crequests\u201d inbox shows that the truth is the other way around. If people could go viral on purpose, everyone would be doing it.\nWhen your words are being seen by millions, people imagine you as someone with power and influence, rather than just some woman in her kitchen, trying to reach a bowl as the kettle boils. Don\u2019t get me wrong\u2014I\u2019m not complaining. This is the small print of social media. If you don\u2019t want the chance of going viral, don\u2019t tweet. But still, the questions you get about the experience are bizarre. In an interview for a book, I was asked, \u201cWhy didn\u2019t you word your tweet in a way that would please everyone?\u201d I decided not to say, \u201cUm... how would one do that?\u201d and instead explained that I didn\u2019t go viral on purpose. I tweeted into my echo chamber, as I always do \u2014 and then one day, the walls fell down.\nThe most mature course of action, and also the hardest, is to step away from social media. The noise of all those voices is deafening, but so is the silence when you switch it off. Read a book, watch an episode of something hilarious, eat cake, temporarily ditch your avatar friends and talk to a face made of flesh. Appreciate the quiet of not having random people from all over the world strolling into your day with unsolicited feedback.\nI worked out much too late that Twitter\u2019s advanced filters are your friend. Part of the stress of going viral is the noise of your mentions going wild. Your tweet already has six figures of likes \u2014 do you really need to see the next 20 people who like it? I\u2019d already muted notifications from anyone with a default profile photo and anyone who hadn\u2019t confirmed their phone number or email address (people who want to remain anonymous, basically), but muting notifications from anyone who didn\u2019t follow me quieted things right down. It also meant I\u2019d have to deliberately click on a tweet and scroll down through the replies if I wanted to be told how stupid I am.\nOne more thing: Your words reached people across the world. You can feel good about it for a little while. Then go back to your life. And be nice to whoever\u2019s next.\nAnd get ready for Day Five, when...\nProbably the most important thing to remember when going viral is not to get addicted to the attention or let it validate you, because after a few days it\u2019s withdrawn, pretty much all at once. By day five, you probably have a lot more followers, and maybe you see a bit more engagement on your tweets than before. But for now, the mic has been turned off, and things go, really startlingly, back to normal.\nBecause nobody remembers what anyone tweeted last week.\n", "link": "https://onezero.medium.com/this-is-how-it-feels-to-go-viral-on-twitter-9310e149a043", "author": "Erica Buist", "comments": [], "claps": "2.6K claps"}, {"num_comments": 14, "title": "2 days left before the start of IEO on the BitForex exchange!", "tags": ["exchange", "bitcoin", "blockchain", "news", "ieo"], "reading_time": 0, "text": "IEO will start on April 23 at 5 p.m. (UTC + 8).IEO will end on April 27 at 5 p.m. (UTC + 8).\nDetailed conditions for participation: https://support.bitforex.com/hc/en-us/articles/360026200872\nFacebook \u2014 Twitter \u2014 Reddit \u2014 Steemit \u2014 Telegram group \u2014 Telegram channel\n#IEO #ico #ADAB #adabsolutions #cryptocurrency #blockchain #Adab #Muslims #investments #crypto-economy #Islamic #finance #cryptocurrency #exchange #FICE #Shariah #trading #cryptocurrencies #Muslim #community #market #digital #economy\n", "link": "https://medium.com/adab-solutions/2-days-left-before-the-start-of-ieo-on-the-bitforex-exchange-aacf1e0a72c0", "author": "ADAB Solutions", "comments": [], "claps": "893 claps"}, {"num_comments": "unspecified", "title": "The Three Causes of the World\u2019s Four Big Problems \u2013 Eudaimonia and Co", "tags": [], "reading_time": 8, "text": "It was a perfect spring day.

The suicide blasts which have been called as a work of hatred, are the deadliest attack the nation has faced since its devastating civil war in a decade\u2019s time. The nation\u2019s history is blotted with 26-year long civil war between the two factions of society. It was the Tamil Tigers, comprising Hindus, Muslims and Christians, a minority rebel group who sought independence from the country\u2019s Buddhist-majority group.\nThough the nation doesn\u2019t have a history of militant Muslims, and no extremist group has claimed the responsibility for the blasts, but the recent investigations revealed the name of an Islamic extremist, Zahran Hashim. Hashim has allegedly been recognised as one of the suicide bombers behind the attack on the Shangri La hotel. CNN-News 18, an Indian media house reported that as per top intelligence sources, Hashim wanted to target Indian High Commission in Sri Lanka.\nSaif Khalid, a journalist from Al-Jazeera, a media house backed by Qatari government, gave a different spin to the story. Khalid said that even mentioning Hashim\u2019s name with regard to the Sri Lankan blastscan be termed as \u201cIslamophobic.\u201d\nKhalid took to Twitter and wrote, \u201cIndian media\u2019s blatant Islamophobia at display.\u201d\nAl-Jazeera is infamous for promoting a pro-Islamist perspective, including the Muslim Brotherhood, since Qatar is known for funding the group.\nHashim shared his extremist thoughts in form of lectures on YouTube, made available for free. It lead Imam Mohamad Tawhidi to criticize the Google-owned video platform, which recently severely restricted Tommy Robinson\u2019s presence.\n\u201cMakes you wonder why YT never banned him for his terrorist ideology,\u201d remarked Tawhidi.\nIn order to curtail the flow of false information the Sri Lankan government imposed 12 hours (6 pm to 6 am) curfew along with blocking some of social media sites including Facebook and YouTube.\nThe bombings which targeted churches and high profile hotels in and around Colombo, clearly aimed to kill Christians, on the auspicious occasion of Easter. The Sri Lankan Defense Minister Ruwan Wijewardena said theserial blasts was a terrorist attack by religious extremists.

Why?\nThese are common issues talked about by developers very often. These stories are experienced in every development team.\nThere are many small factors that are slowly and gradually harming the developers\u2019 projects. They are not immediately destructive. Most of them only do long-term damage. Something you won\u2019t see the damage for a year or more. So when somebody proposes them, often they sound harmless. Even when you start implementing them, they may seem fine. But as time goes on \u2014 and particularly as more and more of these stacks up \u2014 the complexity becomes more apparent and grows until you\u2019re another victim of that ever-so-common horror story.\nTo avoid being one of the victims, you should embrace the fundamental laws of software. You should develop a mindset that every developer should have. This mindset will help you make better decisions in your daily programming journey. You can keep your software as simple as possible. You can protect it from being an unmanageable and complex system.\nHere are the key points that every developer must master.\nFirst of all, you should understand the purpose of the software. There is, in fact, a single purpose of all software: To help people.\nRemember: the purpose of the software is not to show off how intelligent you are. \u2014 Max Kanat-Alexander, Code Simplicity\nDevelopers who cannot conceive the purpose of the software will write bad software. What is bad software? A complex system that doesn\u2019t help people that much.\nWhen you are making decisions about software, you should guide yourself by always keeping this in mind: How we can help? You can even prioritize feature requests this way.\nEvery programmer is a designer.\nWhen software is hard to create or modify, developers spend most of their time focusing on making things \u201cjust work,\u201d and less time focusing on helping users. The design of software aims to make developers job as easy as possible so they can focus on what matters. You will create software that will help users and your software will continue to help them for a long time.\nHowever, if you design a bad system, your software\u2019s lifetime will be short.\nThis brings us to the most important goal of the software design:\nSo there are two key points here: Your design should be easy for you and helpful for others.\nDevelopers who don\u2019t fully understand their work tend to develop complex systems. It can become a vicious cycle: misunderstanding leads to complexity, which leads to further misunderstanding, and so on.\nActually, one of the best ways to improve your design skills is to be sure that you fully understand the systems and tools you are working with.\nUnderstanding is the key difference between a bad developer and a good developer. \u2014 Max Kanat-Alexander, Code Simplicity\nBad developers don\u2019t understand what they are doing, and good developers do. It really is that simple.\nProgramming is the act of reducing complexity to simplicity. A \u201cbad developer\u201d is just somebody who fails to reduce complexity. A \u201cgood developer\u201d is doing everything in their power to make the code as simple as possible for other programmers.\nA good developer creates things that are easy to understand so that it\u2019s really easy to shake out all the bugs.\nNow, developers are generally intelligent people and none of them likes to be treated like they are idiots. Ironically, this leads them sometimes to create things that are a bit complicated. They basically think like this:\n\u201cOh, other developers will understand everything I\u2019ve done here. I should write some clever code that is hard to understand so that they can think that I am very smart.\u201d\nA mistake caused by a wrong mindset-not necessarily by a lack of programming skills. Most of the programming failures happen because of that mentality.\nShowing off that you are smart doesn\u2019t help them.\nDevelopers who are new to your code don\u2019t know anything about it; they have to learn.\nSo, you should ask this question: \u201cDo I want people to understand this and be happy, or do I want them to be confused and frustrated?\u201d\nThe truth is that if other developers who read your code can understand it easily it means that you are doing good.\nThe question is: \u201cHow simple do you have to be?\u201d\nHere is your answer: Stupid, dumb simple.\nThe source of many software failures is complexity. You start out with a simple project that can be completed in one month. Then you add complexity, and the task will take up to three months. Then you start to add features that fulfill some other purpose. Things get very complex because you expand your software purpose for no reason. The tasks will take six months.\nBut that is not the end.\nThen you take each piece of the feature and make it even more complex, and the task will take nine months. Then you start to introduce many new bugs because of the complexity in your code. Naturally, you start fixing them all without thinking how these fixes will affect other parts. At the end, when even small changes become hard. When bug fixes start to introduce new bugs, you will come to one of the most popular programming horror stories: Rewriting code from scratch.\nSo, how did you become a victim of this horror story? Nah, who cares. It\u2019s better to ask: How could you avoid being a victim?\nWell, it is simple. First, you will exactly know your software purpose and its definition. Second, you will be as simple as possible in every piece of code you write. Third, when a new feature or change request comes to the discussion table, you will evaluate them based on your software purpose and question them.\nAs a developer, your first behavior should be resistance to (unnecessary) change. This will prevent you from adding unnecessary codes into your software. When you are convinced that this change is a need, then you can implement it.\nThere are many factors that will increase complexity but those are the most popular ones. Aside from everything, there is only one rule that you should follow:\nYour main purpose is to control complexity, not to create it.\nMaintenance is one of the most important things in software development. Unfortunately, developers usually ignore how important it is. Quick coding and fast shipping look more important than code maintenance. This is the point where they make a mistake \u2014 ignorance of future code maintenance.\nThere will always be some implementation of changes. Not only you have to implement them, but you also have to maintain them over time. As a developer, thinking about future maintenance of changes is one of your main responsibilities.\nSimplicity and complexity are the two main factors that affect code maintenance. The ease of maintenance of any piece of software is proportional to the simplicity of its individual pieces. The effort of maintenance is proportional to the complexity of the software.\nThe one rule that you should follow about maintenance is:\nIt is more important to reduce the effort of maintenance than it is to reduce the effort of implementation.\n\u2014 Max Kanat-Alexander, Code Simplicity\nConsistency is a big part of simplicity. If you do something one way in one place, do it that way in every place. For example, if you name a variable thisIsVariable, then all of your variables should be named that way (otherVariable, anAnotherVariable, etc. not other_variable).\nCode that isn\u2019t consistent becomes harder to understand. Don\u2019t keep forcing developers to relearn the way your system works every time they look at a new piece of it.\nHow do you make decisions about your software?\nWhen you face many possible directions, how do you decide which option is the best? What to focus on and which features you should implement?\nTo answer those questions, there are three important factors that will help you make a better decision. This equation is explained very well in Code Simplicity book:\nThe equation is simple: D=V/E\nThe desirability of any change is directly proportional to the value of the change and inversely proportional to the effort involved in making the change.\nWhen you prioritize your work, you should follow this rule:\nThe changes that will bring you a lot of value and require little effort are better than those that will bring little value and require a lot of effort.\nThe first step is understanding. Know exactly what is being asked. Most hard problems are hard because you don\u2019t understand them. Write down your problem and try to explain it to someone else.\nThe second step is planning. Don\u2019t take action. Sleep on it. Give your brain some time to analyze the problem and process the information but don\u2019t spend too much time on planning.\nThink before acting.\nThe third step is dividing. Don\u2019t try to solve one big problem. When you look at the problem as a whole, it can scare you. Divide it into smaller tasks and solve each sub-problem one by one. Once you solve each sub-problem, you connect the dots.\nWhether creating a new project or adding a feature to existing system developers tend to plan everything out in detail from the beginning. They want the first version to be perfect. They don\u2019t focus on the problem they will solve and how their software will help people. They start by thinking every small detail they could think. Then assumptions and predictions come along followed by \u201cWhat if\u201d sentences. They have to predict the future because they were now so captivated by the imagination of the project in their mind and their project has to be as perfect as they imagined it.\nActually, they are not aware of what\u2019s waiting for them and how much it will cost them by chasing perfection.\nLet me tell you what will happen:\nDo you want this to happen? I guess no.\nWhat you should instead?\nStart small, improve it, then extend.\nThe incremental design should be your guide. Here is how you would use it to design a calculator:\nWhen faced with the fact that their code will change in the future, some developers attempt to solve the problem by designing a solution so generic that (they believe) it will accommodate to every possible future situation.\nBeing too generic involves a lot of code that isn\u2019t needed.\nYou can\u2019t predict the future, so no matter how generic your solution is, it will not be generic enough to satisfy the actual future requirements you will have. Most probably, this time will never come and the code you wrote to solve future problems will increase complexity, make it hard to change the pieces of code and eventually it will become a burden that may destroy your software.\nDon\u2019t predict to future. Be only as generic as you know you need to be right now.\nWhat is the assumption?\nOne of the great killers of a software project is assumptions. Let\u2019s see how an assumption can kill a software project.\nA developer knows that they have to develop a system to do X. Then they think that the system will require them to do Y in the future, and they implement Y as well. They write thousands of lines of code to design Y.\nIn the future, the developer realizes that the current requirements are completely different than what they thought. But now, the software has unnecessary codes that make it hard to throw away because everything is intertwined. It takes months to refactor the code and now they think to rewrite the whole software from scratch which will cause them to lose months.\nTo avoid being a victim like this developer, follow this simple rule:\nCode should be designed based on what you know now, not on what you think will happen in the future. \u2014 Max Kanat-Alexander, Code Simplicity\nIf, for example, you invent your own garbage collector when a perfectly good one exists, you\u2019re going to be spending a lot of time working on the garbage collector, when you could just be working on your software.\nThe only times it\u2019s okay to reinvent the wheel is when any of the following are true:\nSimple rule:\nDon\u2019t reinvent the wheel.\nAs a developer, your first reaction to changing requests should be \u201cNO\u2019\u2019.\nAlways resist adding more code, more features until you are convinced that they are required and there is a need to implement them. Because unnecessary changes will increase defects in your software.\nHow can you know that there is a need for them?\nGo back and remember your software purpose. Then remember the simple equation in prioritizing section.\nDon\u2019t spend your time on repetitive tasks. Set them up and forget about them. They can work while you are sleeping. When you realize that you are doing something again and again, just remember this rule:\nIf you can automate it, automate it.\nI see developers who measure their software quality based on code lines. They think that more code lines mean that they are doing a great job. The software contains hundreds of thousands of lines of code, which means the software they work on is so big.\nThe question that pops up here is: Is it really that big, or there is something wrong there?\nThe answer is that most probably there is something wrong with their design. Most of the simple solutions don\u2019t require a lot of code. You can achieve simplicity with a little bunch of code and solve the problem.\nI\u2019m not saying that the least code is always better. While you want to avoid having less code, you can easily fall in a trap that will cause you to write clever code that is hard to understand for others. You should find a balance.\nThe optimum code is a small bunch of code that is easy to understand, easy to read.\nHow do you measure your productivity?\nBy writing more lines of code or by throwing hundreds of lines of code away?!\nYour main goal should be keeping your code base as small as possible. The question is not \u201cHow can I write more code?\u201d rather it should be \u201cHow can I remove more code?\u201d\nWhen should you add logging and error handling to your project?\nYou should add logging in a very early stage. This will help you to find the problem easily and save your time.\nI see many mistakes when it comes to testing code. Let me give you an example. There were two conditions, a simple if-else block. The developer gave input to the software which will enter inside the if block. They tested it and committed code to source control. Done! What about else block? When the software was shipped to production, that caused a lot of errors. When you test your code, you must execute all new lines at least once and you should start to test parts before the whole.\nWhen you have a bug, first you should reproduce it. You shouldn\u2019t guess the source of the bug and apply fixes based on your assumption. Most probably, you will be wrong. You should see it with your own eyes before applying the fix.\nYou should be reliable. When other developers in your team see that you committed new code to source control, everyone should know that your code is tested, and works.\nUntested code is the code that doesn\u2019t work.\nDevelopers\u2019 estimation sucks.\nUsually, they underestimate things rather than overestimate them. They underestimate the time and effort required to develop a small amount of code or a feature. In the end, this underestimation leads to missing deadlines.\nThe solution: Break the big thing into smaller things. The smaller it is, the easier it is to estimate. You\u2019re probably still going to get it wrong, but you\u2019ll be a lot less wrong than if you estimated a big project.\nRemember:\nEverything takes longer than you think.\nI believe that when you embrace the fundamental principles of software development mentioned in that article, you won\u2019t come to this point. However, if, somehow you make these mistakes and find yourself thinking about rewriting your code, here is the main thing that you should know:\nRewriting code is often a developer delusion, not the solution in most cases.\nWhy is it a delusion?\nWell, because it\u2019s harder to read code than to write it. This is why it is so hard to reuse code. This is why our subconscious mind whispers to us \u201cThrow it away and start over\u201d when we read another developer\u2019s code.\nThere are many cases that you should consider to rewrite your code from scratch and you can read them here. But, here is simple advice for you:\nRefactoring should be the first option.\nOne of the common misconceptions about commenting is that developers add comments that say what code is doing. This is wrong. That should be obvious from reading the code. If it\u2019s not obvious, it means that it is not readable and it should be made simpler.\nWhen you can\u2019t make the code simpler then you should add the comment to explain this complexity.\nThe real purpose of comments is to explain \u201cWHY\u201d you did something, not \u201cWHAT\u201d the code is doing. If you don\u2019t explain this, other programmers may be confused and when they go to change your code they might remove important parts of it.\nWrite a comment to explain \u201cWHY\u201d, not to explain \u201cWHAT\u201d.\nAnother thing is documenting. It is important to have documentation to explain your software\u2019s architecture and every module and components. This is required to see the high-level picture of your software. When a new developer joined your team, it would be easier to understand the software as a whole. When developers don\u2019t have any clue about other parts of the software, they could easily make a mistake in their own part which can affect other parts also.\nFirst things first, always remember this rule:\nDon\u2019t depend on external technologies or reduce your dependency on them as much as possible.\nWhy is that? Because they are another common source of complexity. They can kill your active development and make everything even harder. When you are dependent so much on external technologies, you are not free. What if there is a major bug in that technology? You have to wait for the developers to fix that bug and if this technology is in the center of your project basically you are stuck, you can\u2019t move forward. So that\u2019s why it is so important to pick the right technologies for your project.\nThere are a few factors you should consider before you start using some technology:\nIf you can find the right answer these questions, you can reduce the risk of picking the wrong technology.\nKeep learning. Try out different programming languages and tools, read books on software development. They will give you another perspective. Every day small improvements will make a real difference in your knowledge and skills.\nBe open-minded. Don\u2019t be obsessive about one technology. Use the required technology to solve a specific problem. Don\u2019t be in the unnecessary discussion like Microsoft vs Linux:)\nKnow that every specific problem has its own specific solution.\nA lot of times it\u2019s better to be a quitter than a hero.\nFor example, let\u2019s say you think a task can be done in two hours. But four hours into it, you\u2019re still only a quarter of the way done. The natural instinct is to think, \u201cBut I can\u2019t give up now, I\u2019ve already spent four hours on this!\u201d So you go into hero mode. You\u2019re determined to make it work (and slightly embarrassed that it isn\u2019t already working). You grab your cape and shut yourself off from the world.\nDon\u2019t be obsessive. Know when to quit. Don\u2019t hesitate to ask for help.\nWhen you have something to implement and you are not sure about the solutions, don\u2019t ask others how to so it ...at least not immediately. Instead, try anything and everything you can think of. This is more important the less comfortable you are with a concept or language.\nWhen you can\u2019t think of anything on your own, search! Find answers and try them out. Modify those answers, see if you can understand why they work, adapt them to your code.\n...But always seek advice.\nWhen you have tried everything, and preferably after you have a working solution, now is the best time to seek advice. Look to peers and senior developers to review your code.\nI tried to explain the fundamentals of a good developer mindset in this article. I used some part from Code Simplicity book which has a big impact on my thinking process as a developer. When I read this book, there was a lot of moment that I reacted \u201cohh I did this mistake, I did that too.\u201d I mentioned some important parts of the book and combine them with my experience.\nI strongly recommend you to read Code Simplicity from Max Kanat-Alexander.\nThanks for reading!

In this post, I\u2019d like to share some of the lessons I have learned along the way.\nAfter starting my first job, my first project was a short-term assignment on a long-running project. The project had seen many sprints and many developers. The codebase was large, complex, and with many integrations to external services.\nMy first task was to fix some unit tests that were failing intermittently. The code being tested was relatively old and had been written by a senior developer. Since the functionality worked fine from the UI and had been tested thoroughly by QA, I made the assumption that the issue must be with the tests themselves.\nI spent nearly three days trying to fix tests that weren\u2019t broken. When I explained to my team lead why the fix had taken so long, he taught me my first major lesson. He told me to never assume that someone else\u2019s code is correct just because it looks like it.\nIt\u2019s probably the most important lesson I have learned and can be applied to many situations, not just involving code. Here are a few:\nIn college all of the problems were technical. Figuring out how to make a piece of code work was almost always the issue at hand. In professional life, however, I have found that that\u2019s rarely the case.\nEnsuring communication is clear on a large team working across multiple time-zones. Ensuring processes work, and are clearly documented. Figuring out how to help on-board or mentor new team members. Trying to smoothly introduce something new to the development process. Convincing project management to focus on long term code health when the numbers are pressing their agenda in the present.\nThese are just a handful of examples showing the kinds of things you can run into on a project. In my opinion, they are infinitely more difficult than tracking down that null-pointer that\u2019s been troubling you.\nYou spot a process that can be improved. You immediately decide to automate it. You spend every spare hour developing something that will completely change the way your team works.\nSounds familiar, right? Developers, myself included, love automated solutions.\nWhat have I learned? Don\u2019t immediately go for the code. Stop, and think about the problem, not the solution. Talk to a range of people, not just developers. Figure out if the problem is a technical problem or a process problem first. Then you can figure out the solution.\nSure, coming up with some intricate solution using Docker and perfectly written scripts would be cool, and you\u2019d probably learn a good deal, but proposing a technical solution for a non-technical problem probably won\u2019t help the team in the long run. It might just mask the bigger problem.\nWhen I graduated I loved writing code, learning new languages and frameworks, and anything that involved a technical element.\nDon\u2019t get me wrong, I still do. But, I have come to realize that as long as the tools we use as developers enable us to get our job done, it doesn\u2019t matter what those tools are. In front-end development, there is a new framework every other day. And while it\u2019s important as a developer to keep up, the end users (the important people), don\u2019t care how something works, just that it does.\nI have already mentioned the importance of not automatically assuming that everyone who isn\u2019t a developer is wrong. As well as that, I have learned that each member that makes up your team (BA, QA, project manager, other stakeholders, and so on) is just as important as any developer.\nA project doesn\u2019t work without representation from each role and similarly doesn\u2019t work if resourcing isn\u2019t shared equally amongst the different resource types.\nI have learned that even though it\u2019s the developer who writes the actual code, there would be no need for code without stakeholders, and there would be no stakeholders without quality assurance of what they stand over.\nI hope you can learn something from these lessons. If you have some lessons you have learned, that you would like to share, I would love to hear them in the responses.\nThanks for reading!\n", "link": "https://medium.freecodecamp.org/five-important-lessons-from-four-years-as-a-software-developer-9b367f256226", "author": "Stephen McLean", "comments": ["Sounds like you have become a true Engineer.

But what is \u201cclean code?\u201d I\u2019ve created this short clean code for beginners guide to help you on your way to mastering and understanding the art of clean code.\nImagine you are reading an article. There\u2019s an opening paragraph, which gives you a brief overview of what the article is about. There are headings, each with a bunch of paragraphs. The paragraphs are structured with the relevant bits of information grouped together and ordered so that the article \u201cflows\u201d and reads nicely.\nNow, image the article didn\u2019t have any headings. There are paragraphs, but they are long and in a confusing order. You can\u2019t skim read the article, and have to really dive into the content to get a feel for what the article is about. This can be quite frustrating!\nYour code should read like a good article. Think of your classes/files as headings, and your methods as paragraphs. Sentences are the statements in your code. Here are some of the characteristics of clean code:\nOn to the big question of the day \u2014 how do you actually write clean code as a junior developer? Here\u2019s my top tips to get started.\nBooks would be hard to read if the line spacing was inconsistent, the font sizes were different, and the line breaks were all over the place. The same goes for your code.\nTo make your code clear and easy to read, make sure the indentation, line breaks, and formatting are consistent. Here\u2019s a good and bad example:\nWoah! So much wrong here.\nThis is a bit of an exaggerated example, but it shows the benefit of using consistent indentation and formatting. I don\u2019t know about you, but the \u201cgood\u201d example was much easier on the eyes for me!\nThe good news is that there are many IDE plugins you can use to automatically format code for you. Hallelujah!\nIn the beginning, I talked about how it\u2019s important that your code is easy to read. A big aspect of this is the naming you choose (this is one of the mistakes I made when I was a junior developer). Let\u2019s look at an example of good naming:\nThis code snippet is good for a number of ways:\nChoosing good names when writing clean code for beginners is harder than you think. As your app grows, use these conventions to ensure your code is easy to read:\nBONUS TIP \u2014 if you can\u2019t name your function or method, then that function is doing too much. Go ahead and break it up into smaller functions! E.g if you end up calling your function updateCarAndSave(), create 2 methods updateCar() and saveCar().\nThere is a saying, \u201ccode should be self-documenting\u201d, which basically means, instead of using comments, your code should read well enough reducing the need for comments. This is a valid point, and I guess this makes sense in a perfect world. Yet, the world of coding is far from perfect, so sometimes comments are necessary.\nDocumentation comments are comments that describe what a particular function or class does. If you\u2019re writing a library, this will be helpful for developers who are using your library. Here\u2019s an example from useJSDoc:\nClarification comments are intended for anyone (including your future self) who may need to maintain, refactor, or extend your code. More often than not, clarification comments could be avoided, in favor of \u201cself-documenting code\u201d. Here\u2019s an example of a clarification comment:\nHere\u2019s some comments you should try and avoid. They don\u2019t offer much value, can be misleading and simply clutter the code.\nRedundant comments that don\u2019t add value:\nMisleading comments:\nFunny or insulting comments:\nThe DRY principle is stated as:\nAt its simplest level, this basically means that you should aim to reduce the amount of duplicated code that exists. (Note that I said \u201creduce\u201d and not \u201celiminate\u201d \u2014 There are some instances where duplicated code isn\u2019t the end of the world!)\nDuplicated code can be a nightmare to maintain and alter. Let\u2019s look at an example:\nImagine you are creating a human resources web app for a client. This app allows admins to add users with roles to a database via an API. There are 3 roles; employee, manager, and admin. Let\u2019s look at some of the functions that might exist:\nCool! The code works and all is well in the world. After a while, our client comes along and says:\nSo before we jump in and start coding, let\u2019s step back. Remember at the beginning of this clean code for beginners article, when I said \u201cClean code should be focused\u201d. i.e, do one thing and do it well? This is where our current code has a small issue. The code that makes the API call and handles the error is repeated \u2014 which means we have to change the code in 3 places to meet the new requirements. Annoying!\nSo, what if we refactored this to be more focused? Have a look at the following:\nWe\u2019ve moved the logic that creates an API call into its own method saveUserToDatabase(user) (is that a good name? You decide!) which the other methods will call to save the user. Now, if we need to change the API logic again, we only have to update 1 method. Likewise, if we have to add another method that creates users, the method to save the user to the database via api already exists. Hurray!\nLet\u2019s close our eyes and pretend really hard that we\u2019re making a calculator app. There are functions that are used which allows us to add, subtract, multiply and divide respectively.

You think you\u2019re looking at a cat or a beetle, but those are powerful witches. That nasty potions master is in fact a Nice GuyTM deep undercover. Ron Weasley\u2019s heroic sidekick aesthetic is little more than a cunning illusion spell to conceal an entitled blowhard whose endless gaslighting never faces any real consequences. And for all these years we believed in JK Rowling the progressive icon, until a spate of cruel outbursts forced fans to watch her discard causes she once claimed to champion. The polyjuice potion has worn off.\nJust when #MeToo was taking centre stage, the casting of Johnny Depp as the dark wizard Grindelwald in the Fantastic Beasts films was, at best, obscenely ill-timed. Depp\u2019s violent abuse of then-wife Amber Heard was revealed several months ahead of the first film\u2019s 2016 release. During divorce proceedings the court saw photographs of Heard\u2019s bruised face (along with household wreckage) from when Depp allegedly threw a phone at her with \u201cextreme force\u201d. The judge granted a restraining order against Depp, whose rage reportedly stemmed from an (unsubstantiated) adultery claim. Heard told the court that for \u201cthe entirety of our relationship, Johnny has been verbally and physically abusive.\u201d\nReacting to a post-Weinstein world that no longer has much patience for abuse apologism, Rowling published a statement doubling down on her support for Depp while promoting the second film, telling fans: \u201cBased on our understanding of the circumstances, the filmmakers and I are not only comfortable sticking with our original casting, but genuinely happy to have Johnny playing a major character in the movies.\u201d The author justified this decision by citing \u201cagreements that have been put in place to protect the privacy of two people, both of whom have expressed a desire to get on with their lives.\u201d\nThis is utterly cynical. Rowling entirely sidestepped how Johnny Depp\u2019s lawyers initially accused Amber Heard of \u201cattempting to secure a premature financial resolution by alleging abuse\u201d, a stance they retracted post-settlement and clarified: \u201cneither party has made false accusations for financial gains.\u201d\nWanting to clear the air after a messy divorce is fine. Ignoring Depp\u2019s efforts to lie about his victim in court is not. At no point was it appropriate for an abuser\u2019s powerful friends to uphold that lie \u2014 seemingly for the convenience of a smooth film release.\nRowling must be one of two things here. Either she understands the distinction between whitewashing violence and nurturing peace, in which case her position is exceptionally cruel; or she is catastrophically ignorant of how patriarchal violence works, in which case her status as a feminist icon becomes worthless anyway. She is certainly out of touch with today\u2019s unmissable societal shift on abuse, which alone raises the question of whether her cultural leadership retains any value whatsoever.\nAlthough fans expressed their outrage and disappointment it was deeply disturbing that the Potter author\u2019s commitment to women\u2019s liberation was only now being questioned. Throwing other women under the bus? That\u2019s JK Rowling\u2019s whole brand \u2014 and it has been all along, hiding in plain sight.\nHardcore Potter fans only now coming to terms with Rowling\u2019s predilection to side with bullies may find themselves wondering: how could the author who invented an exclusive school for quasi-aristocratic magical U\u0308bermensch living off invisible slave labour turn out to be so reactionary?\nA literary newcomer when she published the Harry Potter and the Philosopher\u2019s Stone in 1997, the world quickly came to know the 32-year-old Joanne Rowling as a powerful new progressive voice in our culture, for two reasons.\nThe first is thanks to the story\u2019s obvious analogy of 20th century fascism and eugenics, with the nefarious project of Voldemort and his Death Eaters largely obsessed with the preservation and dominion of \u2018pure blooded\u2019 wizards. Rowling described the series as \u201ca prolonged argument for tolerance, a prolonged plea for an end to bigotry\u201d, during a brief period of rising tolerance in British society.\nThe second is that she was writing The Philosopher\u2019s Stone as a penniless and depressed single mother, surviving on welfare. It matters in hindsight that 1997 was the perfect time for Rowling\u2019s career to take off: Tony Blair had just been elected the first Labour Prime Minister since 1979. Margaret Thatcher\u2019s neoliberal hellscape of the eighties had powerfully transformed the UK\u2019s moral universe from a post-Victorian society that took pride in its safety net, to a Malthusian nightmare obsessed with distinguishing between the \u2018deserving\u2019 and \u2018undeserving\u2019 poor. Harry Potter offered a visceral rebuttal to Thatcher\u2019s naked social Darwinism.\nThese reasons don\u2019t simply explain why the Potter books\u2019 emotional traction was so marketable, they also explain why JK Rowling\u2019s work became the cultural apotheosis of Blairism: Rowling was to Tony Blair\u2019s \u2018New Labour\u2019 what court painter Nicholas Hilliard was to Elizabeth I, what the epic poet Virgil was to Augustus Caesar \u2014 not simply a friend of the regime itself but the ideological embodiment of the elite\u2019s highest virtues.\nWith overt socialism regarded as more or less unelectable in the nineties, New Labour was an exquisitely polished (and heavily diluted) adaptation of social democratic morals to survive in the milk-snatcher\u2019s brave new world. It\u2019s hard to imagine now, but Blair entered Downing Street with a public brand that was cool, fresh, dynamic, versatile...but most importantly, \u201cintensely relaxed about people getting filthy rich,\u201d according to Blairite e\u0301minence grise Peter Mandelson, who added: \u201cas long as they pay their taxes.\u201d\nNew Labour\u2019s response to neoliberalism, like most Western centre-left parties those days, was to tip their hat to the new constitution by showing due deference to capitalist \u2018wealth creators\u2019, while asserting that business thrives most efficiently when the workforce is kept relatively safe and healthy. The moral ascendancy of this Third Way (also in keeping with global centrist trends at the time) bolstered itself by strategically aligning with the liberal causes most palatable to nouveau-riche sensibilities \u2014 LGBT rights, boardroom feminism, animal welfare, workplace safety for house elves, and so on.\nThe Potter books had a strong emotional connection to this project, demonstrated for instance in the careful inclusion of a range of ethnic minority characters like Cho Chang and Kingsley Shacklebolt. Rowling\u2019s New Labour leanings were even more explicit in the reformist welfare activism of S.P.E.W. (the Society for the Promotion of Elfish Welfare), particularly Hermione\u2019s dream to one day \u201cget an elf into the Department for the Regulation and Control of Magical Creatures, because they\u2019re shockingly under-represented.\u201d\nMeanwhile in the muggle world, Rowling\u2019s brand as the poster child for free market welfarism became almost as famous as her writing. Her best-known statement to this effect was a cool insult to tax-dodging Tory billionaire Lord Ashcroft in a newspaper op-ed:\nRowling galvanised this point by publishing The Casual Vacancy (2012), a standalone novel about a vicious local election in a fictional West Country village. The Conservatives were finally back in government since 2010, and so she felt move to produce the artlessly heavy-handed parable about modern British poverty \u2014 right as New Labour\u2019s beloved public spending commitments were being cut to ribbons by David Cameron and Nick Clegg\u2019s sordid coalition bromance.\nA review in the Daily Telegraph (the newspaper of choice for Britain\u2019s finance executives and retired colonels) praised the book\u2019s character writing as \u201cso complex and viscerally believable that one finds oneself caring for the worst of them\u201d. Coming from that publication, this is noteworthy: even out of government, Blairite ethics remained so deftly communicated in cultural output like Rowling\u2019s that they still held temporary sway over the emotional rhetoric of the right, for instance in David Cameron\u2019s \u2018Big Society\u2019 concept and his support for gay marriage.\nYet for all the rhetorical goodwill woven through ministries both muggle and magical, nobody was bothering to keep their eyes peeled for horcruxes. Just a few months before the Blair government used a fake arms dossier to drag Britain into the 2003 invasion of Iraq, Margaret Thatcher attended a dinner party at which a guest asked what she viewed as her greatest achievement.\nThe Iron Lady replied: \u201cTony Blair.\u201d\nWhen black actress Noma Dumezweni was cast as Hermione in the 2016 stage production of Harry Potter and the Cursed Child, the usual suspects of racist trolling took to the internet to attack Rowling for it. She responded: \u201cCanon: brown eyes, frizzy hair and very clever. White skin was never specified. Rowling loves black Hermione.\u201d\nFans were generally supportive, despite it being technically a departure from the original text (e.g. Prisoner of Azkaban: Hermione\u2019s \u201cwhite face was sticking out from behind a tree\u201d). A black woman representing Rowling\u2019s work was under attack \u2014 using her position of privilege to truly defend Dumezweni required her to bend the canon a little, so it was the responsible thing to do.\nRowling\u2019s problem, however, is that in the years following the release of the final book of the series she has developed an unpleasantly cynical kind of retcon: shoehorning diversity into the canon and pretending it was always there.\nDumbledore is gay! He was gay all along, in fact! His history with Grindelwald is a gay love story don\u2019t you know! Famous author Jo, woke LGBT ally, basked in her fans\u2019 delight at the 2007 revelation. To be clear, nobody is upset about Dumbledore being gay (nobody worth caring about anyway); representation is great, it should be encouraged.\nThis was not representation.\nIt\u2019s not impossible for an extremely generous reading to interpret Dumbledore\u2019s relationship to Grindelwald as somehow gay. Perhaps Rowling was telling the truth about the canon, and not simply lying after the fact to score cheap woke points while dodging the bothersome work of actually representing queer people \u2014 who can tell? But it hardly matters: even if the books do hint at Dumbledore\u2019s orientation, it\u2019s so vague and obscure as to make her claim insubstantial.\nIf it were truly possible to locate Dumbledore\u2019s sexuality inside of the text (and thus count as actual representation), why did we need the big reveal outside of it? How come nobody saw it until she told them to see it? That\u2019s why it stinks that Rowling waited 3 months after Deathly Hallows was released before making her (effectively unprovable) claim, having long since profited from the record breaking first-day sales: 8.3 million copies in the US alone. That\u2019s not diversity in fiction, that\u2019s highly lucrative brand opportunism.\nPromotional buzz for 2018\u2019s Fantastic Beasts sequel seemed like the perfect opportunity for Rowling to finally clear up this mess even after letting it fester unresolved for a decade, with the film promising to depict Dumbledore\u2019s earlier life. The Crimes of Grindelwald offered a (some would say last) chance to convince fans the gay retcon had ever had a shred of sincerity, to prove that its cowardly opacity and convenient timing were determined by something other than the market value of institutional homophobia. Would director David Yates directly reference Dumbledore\u2019s sexuality in the film? \u201cNot explicitly,\u201d he replied. \u201cBut I think all the fans are aware of that.\u201d\nOh.\nThose queers can do whatever they want behind closed doors but evidently Warner Bros won\u2019t stand for any hand-holding scaring off their loyal customers. Vanity Fair\u2019s review of the film detailed the end product\u2019s tepidity:\n\u201cFantastic Beasts can\u2019t afford a gay Dumbledore thanks to overseas box office,\u201d wrote Forbes\u2019s Scott Mendelson in an article analysing the financial logic behind the decision. \u201cThere is a real financial risk for a movie like Fantastic Beasts having an openly gay lead or major supporting character.\u201d\n\u201cThe question is,\u201d Mendelson asked, \u201cwould Rowling have outed Dumbledore if she knew there\u2019d be a five-part prequel movie series based on him a decade later?\u201d He suspected not:\nPresumably this is the same LGBT-intolerant America that bought all those books in the months prior to Jo\u2019s big gay reveal. But even if there was no financial calculation to the limits of Rowling\u2019s LGBT allyship back then, which is possible, the same cannot be said now. No one but the author herself can be entirely sure when exactly she began lying to fans about her level of commitment to queer solidarity (or whether there\u2019d even been a shark to jump in the first place). What seems certain is that at some point she did choose to tell lies, now grotesquely on display, as if carved into the back of her hand.\nRowling\u2019s own actions are why many former fans can no longer afford to give her the benefit of the doubt when she uses marginalised groups as branding props. It happens so regularly.\nPottermore, Rowling\u2019s online hub for the wizarding world\u2019s extended lore, serves as her own personal encyclopaedia in which she can adjust the canon as she fancies. On the face of it Pottermore comes across like a geeky pet project, almost charming (fans wanting to know their Hogwarts house can take the official Sorting Hat quiz), at least until she posts really weird shit \u2013 yes, literally shit:\nBizarre scatological sorcery that nobody asked for should have been awful enough. But the real sewage running through Pottermore\u2019s basilisk-ridden plumbing is its function as a sales resource, and the real turd magic is the spell Jo casts to transform racism into marketing.\nIn 2016 Rowling published The History of Magic in North America, a four-part series of writings on Pottermore about magic in the New World from the 14th to 17th centuries. She plundered Native American legends to tie the wizarding world into the setting of the upcoming Fantastic Beasts debut, so it was 100% a promotional exercise. We haven\u2019t seen a Warner Bros press release about wizards shitting themselves, after all, but they did feature Rowling\u2019s poorly researched Navajo-inspired content on their website.\nNative American (and particularly Navajo) voices online criticised the cheap marketing ploy for its covetously ahistorical behaviour (for instance: \u201cMy ancestors didn\u2019t survive colonisation so you could use our culture as a convenient prop\u201d). Worse, the lazy informational discrepancies in Jo\u2019s costuming-for-profit demonstrated how scantily she\u2019d educated herself on the culture she was looting.\nHer refusal to respond seemed glaringly unlike her usual fan engagement habits. \u201cRowling is known for responding directly to fan questions on Twitter, and overall being accessible to her fanbase,\u201d observed writer and campaigner Dr Adrienne Keene. \u201cDespite thousands of tweets directed at her about these concerns, she has not addressed it at all. The silence is noted, and it\u2019s deafening.\u201d\nRowling\u2019s wordless detachment in the wake of every such cultural smash-and-grab (she\u2019s a repeat offender) has a distinctly imperial odour. All her efforts to retcon ethnic inclusivity somehow end up making the canon more racist, not less. But since she\u2019s already pillaged the jewels and has no interest in returning them, she just awkwardly pretends the heist never took place. Rowling\u2019s (presumably) semi-inadvertent moonlight requisitions have caused her to morph into a kind of miniature scale Clive of India, conquering foreign lands in a manner that appears \u201cunavoidable and accidental.\u201d\nJK Rowling has of course offered no explanation for why she doesn\u2019t like to talk about the revenues of her appropriation, but it bears more than passing resemblance to the reason why the cult of Winston Churchill doesn\u2019t like to talk about the Bengal Famine: it\u2019s just a thing that happened. Get over it. Stop making up fake words like \u2018reparations\u2019. Why won\u2019t you show some gratitude for all the good I do?\nIt is the nature of defunct orthodoxies and dead empires to eventually descend into tantrums of denial, when the profits of their cruelty become impossible to launder, screaming their fragile delusion louder and louder, as if that could ever silence the crunch of human bones beneath their feet.\nUnless you\u2019re one of those grown-ass adults who still bursts into tears when someone guesses your Hogwarts house wrong, nobody is denying that we question as adults the value systems we are taught as children. It\u2019s normal to learn different life lessons in the real world than you would in the playground, the classroom, the Quidditch pitch. Sooner or later most of us who grew up reading Harry Potter were bound to develop a more complex worldview than those books could give us, fearing as we do the prospect of those other dingbats being left in charge of anything too important. Surely even JK Rowling would wish better for us than a world where the Huffington Post astrology section runs governments.\nEven so, nobody deserves to have their childhood mythology stripped of its moral architecture in such a degrading way as our generation\u2019s: the same author whose books taught us the meaning of courage and tolerance is now publicly behaving in patterns of cowardice and bigotry. If you gaze long into the abyss of JK Rowling\u2019s political instincts, Cornelius Fudge will gaze back into you.\nOn the other hand, if there is such a thing as a belief system to which JK Rowling holds true, it must be found in the wreckage of empires past and present \u2014 ultimately just a different type of void, alas, but one that has at least discernibly structured .\nWhatever weird justification Jo might give herself in private for the sordid transfiguration of her public persona, author and academic Sunny Singh suggests us mere muggles can nevertheless locate the anciens re\u0301gimes guiding Rowling\u2019s cruelty within the silence of her behavioural patterns, rather than the noise of her proclamations. In a Twitter thread that identifies the mechanism by which JK Rowling keeps accidentally(?) making the canon more racist, Singh wrote:\nUnlike the farcical eternity of Rowling\u2019s Wile E. Coyote-esque retcon blunders, Singh\u2019s \u201cbig silence\u201d metric here actually succeeds in diagnosing the colonial ghost in the machine, no matter how far back in the canon you go (like some sort of anti-imperialist time-turner). Peering into the big silence as Singh suggests helps locate points in the canon where Rowling, Blair, and the Empire can all be found relieving themselves in the same corridor, at the same time.\nIt chimes, for instance, with the multiple layers of history which exist simultaneously in Rachel Rostad\u2019s 2013 viral poem about the oriental fetishism that created Cho Chang:\nSimilarly, the canon presents Hermione\u2019s house elf activism as incoherent but twee, with the text poking fun at the clumsily pushy manner of her campaigning and the apparent incoherence of her goals. But reevaluating S.P.E.W. as a moment of nothing-to-see-here imperial static reveals a markedly neat internal logic. It threads the goodness of empire (all the house elves except Dobby love their slavery) through the crumbs-from-the-table nannying of Blairite (knitted jumpers for all and remuneration of freed slaves must never ever be discussed).\nThe original S.P.E.W. canon wasn\u2019t quite fucked up enough yet for Rowling\u2019s tastes, though, with Pottermore once again proudly making everything a bit worse by publishing the quintessential coup de grace of masturbatory centrism: a \u2018both sides\u2019 debate about slavery!\nInside and outside of her work, Rowling\u2019s brand of white feminism (something Hermione herself discarded eventually) is even lazier and more self-congratulatory than your average New Statesman columnist, so it makes perfect sense in Hogwarts\u2019s messily camouflaged shambles of colonial erasure.\nEnslaved elves at Hogwarts perform their domestic labour out of sight (spells transport food to the Great Hall), which helpfully separates them a little further from the African slaves that Britain\u2019s shining meritocracy must never speak of. A hierarchy of such labour is established by the contrast between those elves and the witches of this universe, where meals can be conjured up with a wand and yet the books and films consistently have women waving wands in the kitchen to feed their families. Such an avoidable socio-cultural eyesore ought to have occurred to Jo as completely nonsensical, both magically (thus artistically) and in regards to her supposed commitment to women\u2019s liberation in real life.\nOnce again the discrepancies only make sense as colonial: white feminism isn\u2019t about liberating all women, it\u2019s about hierarchies favouring the \u2018right\u2019 kind of women and throwing to the wolves anyone who fails to fit that mould. If JK Rowling\u2019s bottomless cruelty truly lacked an internally consistent value system, how would she find it this easy to hate trans people while still making a profit (of course) abusing them in her lacklustre detective novels?\nWhite feminism prioritises the wealthy woman\u2019s individual \u2018girl power\u2019 over the safety and dignity of women abused by men in her inner circle. It burgles non-European cultures while dismissing their needs. It pinkwashes itself with shallow tokenism of (cisgender, white, middle class) gay men at the expense of the rest of the LGBTQ community. It applies lipstick to the imperial pig. Crucially, white feminism is one of the most well-known traits of New Labour ideology in practice.\nNo, despite our heartbroken disappointment at a once-beloved childhood hero, it is simply not accurate to say that JK Rowling is a traitor to her original cause \u2014 she is its greatest champion.\nCould there ever have been a happier outcome? Could the books\u2019 blind spots have at one time been simply left to wither away as honest mistakes of their time? Is there an alternate universe where a prescient auror casts reductio! on Tony Blair\u2019s war boner? That last one is definitely the most likely, of course, but we will never know.\nAll we need to know about Joanne Rowling is what she taught us when we were children: \u201cyou can exist without your soul, you know, as long as your brain and heart are still working. But you\u2019ll have no sense of self anymore, no memory, no...anything. There\u2019s no chance at all of recovery. You\u2019ll just \u2014 exist. As an empty shell. And your soul is gone forever.\u201d\n\u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014\nImage credit: @cerejota\n\ud83d\udcdd Read this story later in Journal.\n\ud83d\uddde Wake up every Sunday morning to the week\u2019s most noteworthy Tech stories, opinions, and news waiting in your inbox: Get the noteworthy newsletter >\n", "link": "https://blog.usejournal.com/jk-rowling-was-always-this-terrible-35424df65b54", "author": "Laurie Charles", "comments": ["First, I have to say, this is beautifully written.

But then, working for SAIL is in itself a feeling of pride, a joy ride of emotions, a light reality check of what it takes to be an Alumnus of IIT Guwahati, a breeze of contentment and finally, a sense of accomplishment, to see your baby growing, expanding its roots, helping out hundreds and connecting thousands.  \u2014 Mayank Singla\n", "link": "https://medium.com/@sail.iitguwahati/the-sail-team-speaks-a827898fe87a", "author": "SAIL", "comments": [], "claps": "411 claps"}, {"num_comments": "unspecified", "title": "What I\u2019ve Learned From Collecting Stories of People Whose Loved Ones Were Transformed by Fox News", "tags": [], "reading_time": 8, "text": "By Luke O\u2019Neil\n", "link": "https://medium.com/new-york-magazine/what-ive-learned-from-collecting-stories-of-people-whose-loved-ones-were-transformed-by-fox-news-e9875e0f5e14", "author": "New York Magazine", "comments": [], "claps": "1.4K"}, {"num_comments": 1, "title": "Mapping the Brutal Subscription Battlefield \u2013 Monday Note", "tags": ["digital publishing", "business strategy", "subscription", "media"], "reading_time": 4, "text": "by Frederic Filloux\n(This is part 2/2 of our series on subscriptions, also read: \u201cWinners and losers of the subscription frenzy\u201d)\nThe subscription model spreads like weeds. Just look at your phone screen and consider the services that are or could be linked to a sub: music, storage, apps, games, services like parking, mobility, fitness...\nWhile researching for this column, I found an app called Bobby, dedicated to managing and keeping track of your subscriptions. The fact that there is a need for such a product is eloquent. Two things struck me: in the screenshots used to demo the app, there is not a single news product featured. Second, the mockup amount shown in the visuals: the ballpark seems to be in the hundreds of dollars spent each month in various paid-for services...\nBy switching massively to a subscription model, the news sector is exposing itself to a crushing competition that can be mapped in two dimensions: the amount of discretionary income a person or a household can allocate to information (general, local, specialized) and the time that can be devoted to news consumption.\nThe former is not new. Twenty years ago, you could argue that the spending for the subscription of a national or regional newspaper (plus a magazine or two), was done against other expenses. True. However, two shifts have occurred. The first one is the reversal in the revenue model for news. Twenty years ago, a 25 cents newspaper (less than 40 cents,inflation-adjusted), was based on a revenue split of 80 percent for advertising and 20 percent for circulation. Today\u2019s ratios are inverted: 30 percent for ad and 70 percent for circulation. The survival of the news media industry that produces original and verified editorial needs to tap into the readers pocket, in a recurring way. The problem is, many players want to do the same, and they spare no expenses to capture their share of the market.\nOn the time spent-side, the situation is tricky. Unlike money allocation, time can\u2019t be expanded. Except considering competing with sleep, as Netflix CEO Reed Hastings boasts: \u201cYou get a show or a movie you\u2019re really dying to watch, and you end up staying up late at night, so we actually compete with sleep. And we\u2019re winning!\u201d\nPrecisely, let\u2019s take the case of Streaming Video on Demand (SVOD). A year ago, Deloitte published a compelling study (emphasis mine):\nNetflix consumption is 1h36 per day, and its at-once release of TV series translates into 70 percent of all US viewers and 90 percent of the millennials consuming 5 episodes per sitting (Showtime releasing one by one the episodes of the fourth season of Billions drives me nuts, personally).\nStill on time spent: Spotify eats each 44 min or a day; social interactions more than 2h. Taking in account gaming, the picture is even worse: users of the Amazon-owned platform Twitch spend 1h30 per day; and one-third of Fortnite players spend 6 to 10 hours a week, 38 percent more than 10 hours a week \u2014 and two-third have bought various extras on the game for $85 on average...\nViewing these staggering number, selling subscriptions requires a serious leap of faith.\nBelow is a summary of different services competing against the media industry for money and time spent.\nWhere does the media industry fit in this picture?\nMy (temporary) conclusion is that the news media sector can still pull things off if it focuses on its core product value, invests in tech, stops treating its customers like an airline its passengers. Also, the media should cease begging for public and private subsidies, whining about platforms (Margrethe Vestager don\u2019t write paychecks). It is time for acceptance in the Buddhist way: What is is.\n\u2014 frederic.filloux@mondaynote.com\n", "link": "https://mondaynote.com/mapping-the-brutal-subscription-battlefield-ba8cc8a242eb", "author": "Frederic Filloux", "comments": [], "claps": "32 claps"}, {"num_comments": "unspecified", "title": "The Slandering Of Assange Reveals The Sociopathic Workings Of The Empire\u2019s Propaganda Machine", "tags": ["julian assange", "politics", "media", "propaganda", "lies"], "reading_time": 5, "text": "Amid the attempted prosecution of Julian Assange, the world is in a surreal moment where the truth has been turned on its head. A groupthink has emerged which collectively rejects history and facts so it can stick with the narrative that Assange deserves his persecution. As always, it\u2019s ambiguous whether all the propagandists believe their own lies, and it doesn\u2019t matter whether they do; they\u2019re doing what the centers of power require of them, which is to reinforce the official story.\nThe same goes for regular people. When they tell us that Russia hacked the DNC and gave emails to WikiLeaks, we\u2019re supposed to go along with this consensus within our political circles, whether or not we know this claim has long been disproven by forensic evidence. When they say Assange should be prosecuted for \u201cconspiracy to commit computer intrusion,\u201d we shouldn\u2019t object, even if we remember that Obama\u2019s DOJ found this very same charge against Assange was not a legitimate reason for prosecution.\nThese and the other aspects of the corporate media\u2019s mythology around WikiLeaks, from the claim that they\u2019ve \u201cdoctored\u201d emails to the claim that their founder is a rapist, are simply part of what we need to accept in order to be part of the establishment\u2019s clique. As C.J. Hopkins has written about the media\u2019s war against Assange, \u201cThe demonization of the empire\u2019s enemies is not a deception ... it is a loyalty test. It is a ritual in which the masses (who, let\u2019s face it, are de facto slaves) are ordered to display their fealty to their masters, and their hatred of their masters\u2019 enemies.\u201d\nSo many people numbly absorb this propaganda because they\u2019re not aware of the vast and sophisticated machine which seeks to mold their minds. The smear campaign against Assange has been filled with psychological tricks that are reminiscent of CIA public opinion influence operations. It\u2019s likely no coincidence that Assange has been slandered with accusations of pedophelia when the \u201cpedophile\u201d smear is a known CIA character assassination tactic that\u2019s been used to undermine numerous activists. Neither has it been a chance occurrence for Assange and WikiLeaks to be frequently characterized as Russian assets at a moment when the CIA and other facets of the deep state seek to reignite anti-Russian hysteria.\nThe U.S. government\u2019s role in the effort to destroy Assange\u2019s reputation is made even more obvious from the fact that in 2008, central actors within the intelligence community outright promised to carry out a character assassination campaign against him. In 2008, the Cyber Counter-intelligence Assessment Branch of the US Defense Department created a secret document which explained their plan to destroy both WikiLeaks and Julian. This plan-which has no doubt been shared by the CIA-is summarized by John Pilger as follows:\nThey described in detail how important it was to destroy, and I quote, \u201cthe feeling of trust that is Wikileaks\u2019 centre of gravity\u201d. This would be achieved, they wrote, with threats of exposure and criminal prosecution and an unrelenting assault on reputation.\nSince 2013, when the U.S. government implemented the negation of a 1948 law which banned the use of government psyops on American citizens, these operations for deceiving the American public about Assange and WikiLeaks have thoroughly permeated the media environment both in the U.S. and abroad. The relentless and sometimes almost identical hit pieces from The Guardian, the Washington Post, the New York Times, and other major publications throughout the West hint at a coordinated effort behind the scenes to drive popular sentiment against the favor of WikiLeaks and Assange.\nThe often grotesque nature of the attacks against Assange-like the slander that he smeared feces on the walls of the Ecuadorian embassy or the unsubstantiated claim that he often smells bad-also show the carefully considered lies that go into the attacks against Assange. These attempts to make people see the man as physically repulsive serve the function of making people unwilling to listen to the logical arguments for why they should oppose his prosecution. They\u2019re textbook pieces of psychological manipulation, ones which could easily originate from the CIA psychologists who study how to mold people\u2019s perceptions.\nThis all makes it logical that at this moment, at a time when the U.S. government is close to prosecuting Assange for practicing journalism, the Western media\u2019s years-long practice of lying about Assange is being ramped up. For example, when I do a search for Assange\u2019s name, the very first thing that comes up is a hit piece from The Guardian titled: \u201cI love stories of badly-behaved houseguests \u2014 and Julian Assange has raised the bar.\u201d There are also articles accusing Assange of lying about Seth Rich being the source of the DNC emails because Mueller\u2019s new report claims-despite the overwhelming evidence to the contrary-that Russia hacked the DNC. The empire\u2019s propagandists need to find a way to get people not to worry about the dangerous implications for press freedom that Assange\u2019s prosecution would entail, and continuing to destroy Assange\u2019s character is the route they\u2019ve taken.\nThe campaign against Assange has ironically revealed the most about the character of the people who\u2019ve been behind it. From studying the lies that top government and media figures tell about Assange, and from noticing the emotional tricks that they strategically put into their lies, we\u2019ve learned that these people collectively behave as a sociopath. To serve their cause of advancing the agenda of the U.S./NATO empire, they lie routinely and without remorse. The only thing that matters to them is protecting power. This fact makes it clear how to defeat them: treat them as the professional manipulators that they are, and resist their manipulations in the same way one would resist the manipulations of an abusive partner.\nAnd in the case of both personal relationships and politics, the biggest rule for breaking free from a sociopathic manipulator can be summarized as: don\u2019t let yourself be gaslighted. The people driving Assange\u2019s persecution want you to disregard what you know to be true so that you\u2019ll conform to their narratives. If we take this psychological power away from them and determinedly speak out against their smears against Assange, they won\u2019t be able to control the narrative about Assange any longer.\n", "link": "https://medium.com/@rainershea/the-slandering-of-assange-reveals-the-sociopathic-workings-of-the-empires-propaganda-machine-cc8352fc19fd", "author": "Rainer Shea", "comments": [], "claps": "220 claps"}, {"num_comments": 22, "title": "Welcome to Refereum 2.0 \u2013 Refereum \u2013 Medium", "tags": ["games", "refereum", "gaming", "streaming"], "reading_time": 2, "text": "We\u2019re excited to share with all of you what we\u2019ve been working on since late last year.\nThe Refereum Hub is an elegant, all-new platform that we\u2019ll be updating with new quests daily.

He was just as thin several years ago as he is today at age 30. What he was gunning for was a cognitive hack. \u201cThe plan was longevity and the cognitive benefit,\u201d he says. Woo wanted to clear the \u201cbrain fog,\u201d as it\u2019s colloquially called, and optimize his mental agility.\n\u201cThe first two times I tried to fast it was terrible. It was hard,\u201d he says. \u201cBy the third time, it felt pretty refreshing. I felt pretty clear.\u201d\nWoo now cuts out all food for 24 hours once or twice a week. Every three months, he goes 36 to 72 hours without a meal. He justifies his cleanses based on several years of tracking his own blood sugar with a continuous glucose monitor he wears on his arm. While fasting, Woo says, his blood sugar remains steady throughout the day, instead of spiking and crashing after a big lunch.\nAs a Silicon Valley entrepreneur, Woo is perhaps the ideal guinea pig for this sort of diet experimentation. He\u2019s part of an ever-growing movement of biohackers finagling with nutrition in service of the one part of our anatomy that no one ever sees: the brain.\nEating for brain energy and focus has become one of the central underpinnings of a series of diet trends growing in popularity. There\u2019s intermittent fasting; the low-carb and high-fat ketogenic diet; the MIND diet, which combines the Mediterranean diet and the heart-healthy Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) diet; and the Bulletproof Coffee diet, founded by biohacker Dave Asprey, which prescribes dunking a pat of butter into your morning brew for better energy and cognitive function. The diets have an especially notable following among technocrats like Woo. Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey says he does a daily 22-hour fast, and Kevin Rose, the co-founder of Digg, launched an app called Zero to help people track daily fasting.\nData suggests that lifestyle behaviors, including diet, can play an important role in keeping the brain healthy and preventing cognitive decline, though dietitians and researchers caution against using small studies of unique eating trends to inform an entirely new food regimen. \u201cMore now than ever, people are looking for a quick fix,\u201d says Marjorie Cohn, a registered dietician and spokesperson for the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics. \u201cI think a lot of what explains it is our access to information and social media. A lot of these diet hacks are being promoted and circulated not from professionals, but from nonprofessionals promoting nonprofessionals.\u201d\nEven so, eating patterns like occasional fasting or eating mostly fats and protein\u2014while perhaps unnecessarily strict\u2014may demonstrably improve a person\u2019s reported energy and focus. Whether they actually change the brain is still being worked out. Meanwhile, the Woos of the world are eagerly adapting to new ways of eating before the results are clear. \u201cWho did the randomized controlled trial on the FDA food pyramid?\u201d says Woo.\nThere are plenty of anecdotal observations about the effects of extreme diets and, in some cases, short-term randomized trials sussing out the effects of various diets. But long-term, randomized trials\u2014the gold standard of scientific inquiry, where people are followed for more than 20 years to see how certain diets might influence diseases or conditions later in life\u2014are in short supply.\nA salient feature that can be observed across mental clarity diets is that they eliminate some type of food or food group. All of them have barely any room for processed foods. Some explicitly outlaw sugar and white-flour products, like pizza and cereal. Experts say that it\u2019s likely the removal of these food groups that creates the clearheadedness and that counteracts so-called brain fog.\nLast September, I spent an entire month following the all-meat-all-the-time carnivore diet. I could only eat foods like steak, chicken, eggs, venison, salmon, brisket, and absolutely nothing that could be classified as a fruit, grain, or vegetable. It was in the service of journalism\u2014a piece I wrote for Outside magazine, although I was personally curious how protein-packed meals with no carbs, sugar, or vegetables would make me feel.\nMy mother was certain I would become gravely ill, but after eating a diet heavy on ribeye steak, I felt less groggy and more energetic. Other people on the same diet told me their brain fog had also lifted and that they were less sleepy. People who follow the ketogenic diet\u2014which is basically a serving of carbohydrates away from the full-on carnivore lifestyle\u2014report similar effects.\nNutrition experts like to point out why people on low-carb or no-carb diets might feel more awake throughout the day: Glucose is the brain\u2019s chosen fuel, and it typically gets it from carbs and sugar. The Western diet tends to be heavy on simple carbohydrates. If you eat a slice of pizza and wash it down with a soda for lunch, your glucose will spike, which will cause an overcompensation in the amount of insulin your body produces to process that blood sugar. Around the middle of the afternoon, you will begin to feel sluggish\u2014because your glucose levels have plummeted.\nWhen you eat heavily processed foods, such as potato chips or a fast-food hamburger, your body responds to them as though they are foreign objects invading its turf, which causes inflammation. Inflammation itself is linked to many chronic diseases that appear over time, such as diabetes, arthritis, and coronary heart disease.\n\u201cThe best thing is to understand that for your brain to feel clear, you need to cut down on the sugars, your gut needs to be happy, and you need to have a nutrient-rich diet,\u201d says Dr. Eva Selhub, a former instructor at Harvard Medical School who now runs her own wellness consultancy. \u201cThe reason we\u2019re a sick nation is because everything has carbohydrates in it, and that\u2019s why people feel better when they do these diets.\u201d\nIn the keto and carnivore diets\u2014as in Woo\u2019s fasting diet\u2014the body uses fat as its energy source instead, converting it into liver-produced chemicals called ketones, which the brain can also use as fuel. In a small study published in 2012, researchers put 23 adults on a high-carb or very low-carb diet and found that the men and women following the low-carb diet demonstrated better memory function.\n\u201cYour brain prefers glucose to everything else,\u201d says Rachele Pojednic, an assistant professor of nutrition at Simmons University. \u201cIf you\u2019re on the ketogenic diet, it could be that ketones make you feel better, but we don\u2019t know that yet because we haven\u2019t studied this pathway. Most of the ketogenic data we have is on weight loss.\u201d\nBulletproof Coffee devotees usually say the fat from butter makes it so that your body absorbs caffeine at a slower pace, creating a lasting alertness instead of a sudden energy jolt. While there\u2019s no research that says butter in your coffee is harmful, there\u2019s no conclusive research that says buttered coffee leads to better brain focus.\n\u201cIt might just be that you\u2019re not hungry because you just ate a ton of calories in the morning and so when you get to the afternoon you\u2019re not tired,\u201d says Pojednic. \u201cWhat the data is showing overall is that it\u2019s not one nutrient in isolation, which is what a lot of these diets really focus on.\u201d\nWhile there\u2019s compelling evidence to suggest that eating does have an impact on the brain, there\u2019s little evidence that extreme diet patterns are better than the other, more low-key methods. \u201cI don\u2019t believe something until I see the scientific evidence,\u201d says Martha Clare Morris, professor of epidemiology at Chicago\u2019s Rush University Medical Center (RUMC). \u201cIt\u2019s amazing to me how many people say they\u2019re on the keto diet when we don\u2019t know the long-term effects.\u201d\nIn her quest for evidence on a diet that does nourish the brain, Morris teamed up with other researchers at RUMC and the Harvard School of Public Health and arrived at one answer in 2015: the MIND diet. It pulls together foods from the Mediterranean diet, like whole grains, legumes, and fish, and the plant-based low-fat DASH diet, which is designed to combat high blood pressure. Traditionally, both diets are recommended to prevent heart disease.\n\u201cThese are two great diets that have been shown in randomized trials to have beneficial effects on chronic diseases of aging, lowering inflammation, and preventing diabetes in people with high glucose levels,\u201d says Morris, who has spent 25 years researching how diets affect brain aging.\nAntioxidant nutrients, such as vitamins C, E, and B, as well as omega-3 fatty acids, are found to have positive effects on our cognitive capabilities by counteracting two of the factors thought to cause neurodegenerative diseases: oxidative stress and inflammation.\nIn a study of the MIND diet that lasted almost five years and included more than 900 people ages 58 to 98, Morris and her team demonstrated that even moderate adherence to the MIND diet led to a 35% reduction in developing Alzheimer\u2019s disease. Now they\u2019re conducting a follow-up randomized trial of the MIND diet to measure cognition over a three-year period. Morris says research like this is necessary to truly gauge the effects of a diet for brain health.\nWhat\u2019s notable about the MIND diet is that the eating plan is not revolutionary. It tracks with what\u2019s long been recommended as part of any healthy diet. Meal plans with foods high in antioxidants, like berries, nuts, seeds, and leafy greens, as well as nutrient-dense foods like beans and foods packed with omega-3s, like fish, all appear to help the brain.\n\u201cHonestly, the solid research is just swinging back around to what our grandparents and great-grandparents ate,\u201d says the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics\u2019 Cohn. \u201cWe should be eating fat; we should be eating eggs. More whole food, less processed food.\u201d\nIf the best way to eat for the brain is to follow the usual advice\u2014eat more fruits and vegetables\u2014then why are restrictive diets so enduring? After politics and religion, the virtues of respective diets are perhaps the next easiest subject to conjure up vehement disagreements.\n\u201cA lot of this comes down to subjective experience,\u201d says Cohn. \u201cIf somebody really feels like it works for them, honestly, you can\u2019t argue with that.\u201d\nPojednic of Simmons University says there may be a psychological component that makes mental clarity diets feel more effective for the people who follow them than standard healthy eating. \u201cIs simply having this feeling of control enough to help your brain?\u201d she says.\nWoo agrees that fasting is morale-boosting. The longest fast he ever did was for seven days. \u201cIt gives you confidence to be able to do something that seems impossible,\u201d he says. \u201cThat\u2019s a psychological side effect of being able to control your animal instincts and channel them in a productive way.\u201d\nThe bottom line is that these various hacks for uncorking brainpower share a strong redeemable characteristic: They all call for cutting out the crud that makes you feel foggy, groggy, or lethargic. They also lean into fatty foods that contain omega-3s, which are believed to be important for brain health by preserving cell membranes and aiding communication between brain cells. \u201cThese diets are wonderful in that they\u2019re getting people to be more aware and self-conscious about what they\u2019re putting into their body,\u201d says Selhub, the doctor and wellness consultant. \u201cThe key is: What am I learning from this diet about how my body feels?\u201d\nIt\u2019s a matter of testing out what works best for you. Not a single person I spoke to advocated die-hard adherence to one of these diets\u2014not even Woo. \u201cIt\u2019s less of a religious thing,\u201d he says.\n", "link": "https://elemental.medium.com/the-science-behind-the-mental-clarity-diet-a6b2d765ffa6", "author": "Andrew Zaleski", "comments": [], "claps": "5.8K claps"}, {"num_comments": 98, "title": "Claude Shannon: How a Real Genius Solves Problems \u2013 Personal Growth \u2013 Medium", "tags": ["technology", "life", "science", "life lessons", "self improvement"], "reading_time": 6, "text": "It took Claude Shannon about a decade to fully formulate his seminal theory of information.\nHe first flirted with the idea of establishing a common foundation for the many information technologies of his day (like the telephone, the radio, and the television) in graduate school.\nIt wasn\u2019t until 1948, however, that he published A Mathematical Theory of Communication.\nThis wasn\u2019t his only big contribution, though. As a student at MIT, at the humble age of 21, he published a thesis that many consider possibly the most important master\u2019s thesis of the century.\nTo the average person, this may not mean much. He\u2019s not exactly a household name. But if it wasn\u2019t for Shannon\u2019s work, what we think of as the modern computer may not exist. His influence is enormous not just in computer science, but also in physics and engineering.\nThe word genius is thrown around casually, but there are very few people who actually deserve the moniker like Claude Shannon. He thought differently, and he thought playfully.\nOne of the subtle causes behind what manifested as such genius, however, was the way he attacked problems. He didn\u2019t just formulate a question and then look for answers, but he was methodological in developing a process to help him see beyond what was in sight.\nHis problems were different from many of the problems we are likely to deal with, but the template and its reasoning can be generalized to some degree, and when it is, it may just help us think sharper, too.\nAll problems have a shape and a form. To solve them, we have to first understand them.\nThe importance of getting to an answer isn\u2019t lost on any of us, but many of us do neglect how important it is to ask a question in such a way that an answer is actually available to us.\nWe are quick to jump around from one detail to another, hoping that they eventually connect, rather than focusing our energy on developing an intuition for what it is we are working with.\nThis is where Shannon did the opposite. In fact, as his biographers note in A Mind at Play, he did this to the point that some contemporary mathematicians thought that he wasn\u2019t as rigorous as he could be in the steps he was taking to build a coherent picture. They, naturally, wanted the details.\nShannon\u2019s reasoning, however, was that it isn\u2019t until you eliminate the inessential from the problem you are working on that you can see the core that will guide you to an answer.\nIn fact, often, when you get to such a core, you may not even recognize the problem anymore, which illustrates how important it is to get the bigger picture right before you go chasing after the details. Otherwise, you start by pointing yourself in the wrong direction.\nDetails are important and useful. Many details are actually disproportionately important and useful relative to their representation. But there are equally as many details that are useless.\nIf you don\u2019t find the core of a problem, you start off with all of the wrong details, which is then going to encourage you to add many more of the wrong kinds of details until you\u2019re stuck.\nStarting by pruning away at what is unimportant is how you discipline yourself to see behind the fog created by the inessential. That\u2019s when you\u2019ll find the foundation you are looking for.\nFinding the true form of the problem is almost as important as the answer that comes after.\nIn a speech given at Bell Labs in 1952 to his contemporaries, Shannon dived into how he primes his mind to think creatively when addressing things that are keeping him occupied.\nBeyond simplifying and looking for the core, he suggests something else \u2014 something that may not seem to make a difference on the surface but is crucial for thinking differently.\nFrequently, when we have spent a lot of time thinking about a problem, we create a tunnel vision that rigidly directs us along a singular path. Logical thinking starts at one point, makes reasoned connections, and if done well, it always leads to the same place every time.\nCreative thinking is a little different. It, too, makes connections, but these connections are less logical and more serendipitous, allowing for what we think of as new thinking patterns.\nOne of Shannon\u2019s go-to tricks was to restructure and contrast the problem in as many different ways as possible. This could mean exaggerating it, minimizing it, changing the words of how it is stated, reframing the angle from where it is looked at, and inverting it.\nThe point of this exercise is simply to get a more holistic look at what is actually going on.\nIt\u2019s easy for our brain to get stuck in mental loops, and the best way to break these mental loops is to change the reference point. We are not changing our intuitive understanding of the problem or the core we have identified, just how it is expressed.\nWe could, for example, ask: What is the best way to solve this? But we could also ask: What is the worst way to solve this? Each contains knowledge, and we should dissect both.\nJust as a problem has forms, it also has many shapes. Different shapes hold different truths.\nWhile it\u2019s important to focus on the quality of ideas, it\u2019s perhaps just as important to think about the quantity. Not just concerning total numbers but also how you get to those numbers.\nTo solve a problem, you have to have a good idea. In turn, to have a good idea, it\u2019s often the case that you have to first go through many bad ones. Even so, however, throwing anything and everything at the wall isn\u2019t the way to do that. There is more to it than that.\nDuring the Second World War, Shannon met Alan Turing, another computer science pioneer. While Turing was in the US, they had tea almost every day. Over the years, they continued to keep in touch, and both men respected the other\u2019s thinking and enjoyed his company.\nWhen discussing what he thinks constitutes genius, Shannon used an analogy shared with him by Turing, from which he extrapolated a subtle observation. In his own words:\nHe humbly denied that he was in the latter category, instead putting people like Newton in there. But if we look beyond that, we can see what is at play. It\u2019s not just about quantity.\nEvery input has a particular essence at its core that communicates a truth that lies behind the surface. This truth is the foundation for many different solutions to many different problems.\nWhat Shannon is getting at, I suspect, is that generating good ideas is about getting good at multiplying the essence of every input. Bad ideas may be produced if you get the essence wrong, but the better you identify it, the more effectively you\u2019ll be able to uncover insights.\nDoubling the output of your ideas is the first step, but capturing the essence is the difference.\nMuch of life \u2014 whether it\u2019s in your work, or in your relationships, or as it relates to your well-being \u2014 comes down to identifying and attacking a problem so that you can move past it.\nClaude Shannon may have been a singular genius with a unique mind, but the process he used isn\u2019t out of reach for any of us. His strength was in this process and its application.\nGood problem-solving is a product of both critical and creative thinking. The best way to combine them is to have some process in place that allows each to shine through.\nThinking patterns shape our minds. The goal is to have the right thinking patterns doing so.\nI write at Design Luck. It\u2019s a free high-quality newsletter with unique insights that will help you live a good life.

Whether it\u2019s being plastered everywhere online, or served on a BLT in your local cafe, something about bacon has captured the attention of people around the world. It might have a bit to do about a very successful marketing campaign by Sigmund Freud\u2019s nephew (yes, actually), it might be because we\u2019ve idealized this cured meat as the peak of delectability.\nOf course, it might just be that bacon is delicious.\nBut, according to news from across the world, bacon isn\u2019t the savior that we thought it was. No, bacon \u2014 and all preserved meats, in fact \u2014 are actually killing you from the inside. It turns out that eating bacon gives you a 20% increased risk of bowel cancer, which, if you\u2019re like me and enjoy bacon but don\u2019t like cancer, sounds pretty damn terrifying.\nThankfully for all of us, the headlines were wrong. You can get back to your butties.\nBacon probably isn\u2019t giving you cancer.\nThe recent study that has everyone writing meaningless meat headlines was another Big Scary Study. I\u2019ve written about these before \u2014 basically, the idea is that you take a very large group of people, test them for issues, and it\u2019s even scarier because so many people were involved.\nThat\u2019s not really how statistics work, but we run with it anyway.\nThis Big Scary Study took 500,000 people in the UK, asked them questions about their diet, and then followed up an average of 6 years later. At follow-up, people who ate the highest amount of red and preserved meats were at a 20% increased risk of getting colorectal \u2014 bowel \u2014 cancer, compared to people who ate very little/none. This was equivalent to eating about 76 grams of red and preserved meat a day, or ~3 rashers of bacon.\nHence the headlines.\nThe scientists in the study also controlled for a range of factors to try and ensure that the result reflected the truth. What this means is that they took into account things like age, weight, and education, which we know from previous research can have an impact on who gets bowel cancer. They accounted for all the factors they knew about in the study\u2019s statistical model, meaning that it\u2019s unlikely that these had an impact on the outcome.\nSo the study showed that more bacon meant more cancer. But before you run screaming from your full English, it\u2019s worth noting that there\u2019s more to the story.\nThe first big problem with the way that this study was reported is a fairly simple issue: relative vs absolute risk. It\u2019s something that most people find very easy to understand, but can completely change how you think about research.\nThe basic idea is that relative risk is the risk ratio \u2014 the chance of one thing happening divided by the chance of another thing happening. Absolute risk is the risk difference \u2014 the chance of one thing happening subtracted from the other thing.\nSo let\u2019s look at what happened in this study. There were 68,359 people who ate the lowest amount of bacon, and of these 274 got cancer. There were 192600 people who ate the highest amount of meat, and of these 1209 got cancer. That makes the rates 274/68359 = 0.4% and 1209/192600 = 0.6%\nBased on those figures:\nRelative risk = 0.006/0.004 = 1.5 = 50% increased risk of cancer\nAbsolute risk = 0.006\u20130.004 = 0.002 = 0.2% increased risk of cancer\nWe could say that there was a 50% increased risk of cancer \u2014 or, in the adjusted model (remember all those confounders?), a 20% increased risk \u2014 but we know that there are issues with this. It\u2019s true, but doesn\u2019t really communicate the real risk to individuals. It\u2019s much better to communicate the risk using the absolute value, i.e. that there was an 0.2% increased risk of colorectal cancer for eating an extra 3 rashers of bacon per day.\nNot nearly as scary when I put it like that, is it?\nTo put it another way, about 4 people out of every 1,000 get bowel cancer. In a group of people who eat more than triple the normal amount of red and preserved meat, 6 out of 1,000 will get bowel cancer.\nMuch less scary, but much more meaningful.\nThere were other issues with interpreting the study. It didn\u2019t establish causality \u2014 we can control for the confounders that we know about, a bit harder for the ones we don\u2019t/can\u2019t measure \u2014 and it was done mostly in middle-aged white people in the UK. It\u2019s possible that this result was an artifact of social factors, and even if it wasn\u2019t, it only really applies to white people in the UK.\nBut really, the biggest issue was that the risk was wildly overblown considering how complex this all is.\nWhich brings us to the headlines. Yes, they were technically correct, but I think we can all agree that \u201cKILLER RASHER: Pack of bacon a week increases risk of bowel cancer by a fifth\u201d doesn\u2019t really communicate the risk in a meaningful way.\nScience is hard. Epidemiology is a complex field and communicating risk can be extremely difficult. More importantly, we\u2019ve built a media system that rewards sensationalism, and doesn\u2019t condemn misrepresentations, which means that the best way to earn money as a publisher is to churn out nonsense. The only way to really change that is for all of us, everywhere, to question what lies behind the headlines, and actually read some of the research we hear about in the news.\nIt might be hard, but at least we\u2019ll know what\u2019s really happening.\nThe media was wrong. We should probably cut back on bacon \u2014 it\u2019s a calorie-dense food, and generally speaking not great for your health \u2014 but realistically the risk that it will give you, the person reading this article, cancer is very slight.\nDon\u2019t worry too much about the headlines.\nThere are worse things than an extra rasher of bacon in the morning.\nIf you enjoyed, follow me on Medium, Twitter or Facebook!\nYou can now listen to Gid on the Sensationalist Science podcast:\n", "link": "https://medium.com/@gidmk/bacon-is-not-the-enemy-bd861c2adac9", "author": "Gid M-K; Health Nerd", "comments": [], "claps": "355 claps"}, {"num_comments": 8, "title": "Are Dreams a View into Another Dimension? \u2013 Jason Weiland \u2013 Medium", "tags": ["physics", "science", "reality", "theory", "dreams"], "reading_time": 4, "text": "Do you ever wonder what dreams are \u2014 exactly? Scientists have long tried to figure it out. The basic definition of dreams is they are thoughts, images, and sounds that the subconscious plays in our mind like a movie.\nScientists have said that dreams are a way for our to mind to process memory offline and that dreams improve cognitive function. There are a lot of theories, but no one knows for sure. The brain is so complex that we can only guess at the limits of its function.\nBut what if dreams were something else? What if dreams were a portal into other dimensions? We don\u2019t know how our mind operates, so what if one of it\u2019s functions is allowing us a view into other universes?\nI\u2019ve had an interest in the concept of the multiverse for quite some time. I have a fertile mind and a penchant for cosmology and quantum physics.\nMy most recent obsession has been watching The OA on Netflix. If you haven\u2019t seen the show, it\u2019s about a group of people who can travel to different dimensions because of some experienced trauma. I don\u2019t want to say more because you should watch it yourself. I don\u2019t want to ruin it for you.\nUnlike many other shows on Netflix, the characters are real and relatable. The story is fascinating, and I am holding my breath until the third season.\nThe show opens a new perspective on the idea of the multiverse. To understand, you should know a little more about the multiverse theory.\nThe multiverse theory \u201cstates that there may be multiple or even an infinite number of universes (including the universe we consistently experience) that together comprise everything that exists: the entirety of space, time, matter, and energy as well as the physical laws and constants that describe them.\u201d \u2014 UniverseToday.com\nSo, the show opened a new thread in my brain, and I\u2019ve been thinking nonstop about the concept. Like many of you, I overthink to the nth degree. So you can guess my brain has been churning so fast that smoke comes out of my ears.\nAfter a night full of vivid dreams about my brother, I asked my wife if she ever thought that dreams were just a way for us to see into another reality. I know she was humoring me because I am always telling her all the ideas that my writer\u2019s brain thinks up. But, it got me thinking about dreams.\nHave you ever had a dream so real that when you woke up, you weren\u2019t sure you were awake? Dreams can be so vivid, that you will swear that you were there in that place and time.\nWhat if you were?\nWhat if one of the functions of our brain is to connect with other universes and give us glimpses of other realities? What if we are seeing a universe where you took a different fork in the path of life and things turned out very different for you and the people around you?\nWhat about the dreams so fanciful, they are almost like science fiction? I have a reoccurring dream that I have god-like powers, and I fight injustice and heal the world of its ills. What if in some reality I am a god?\nSpend some time thinking about the possibilities. You may begin to believe that there are other universes where our wildest dreams are being played out.\nThink about this concept a little more:\nYes, I know that some of you think I may have gone off the deep end. None of this has been proven, but at one time neither was gravity.\nScoff at me all you want, but real science is driven by dreamers.\nRight now, nothing is science fact. But who is to say in a few years, after more technological advancements (like quantum computing), the multiverse theory won\u2019t be a fact of our life?\nIf we can get some great minds to prove this theory, and we don\u2019t allow dogma to incite fear in society, we can prove that we exist in other dimensions.\nWouldn\u2019t it be awesome to know that some form of ourselves goes on living forever in one of the other universes?\nI for one, feel hope like never before!\n", "link": "https://medium.com/@jasonjamesweiland/are-dreams-a-view-into-another-dimension-b2d09f68c657", "author": "Jason Weiland", "comments": ["I think dreams are more than what many think.

If an iOS app has been around for more than a few years, it\u2019s likely to have had many developers contributing on many features that made it into many releases. Often, the result can be a very large codebase with varying degrees of modularization, long build times, and not very clean code.\nThe iOS app at Scout24 was in such a state not long ago, and I\u2019d like to share with you how we made significant improvements to our development environment and what the benefits were.\nIf you\u2019ve been developing with Swift in a large project, you are probably too familiar with the amount of time it takes to build the entire app module, even after a small change. There are tons of resources on how to improve the overall duration.\nSwift has a lot of great language features, but those features come at the cost of longer compile times. Even after making a small change, you could be waiting for up to a few minutes before you can see the results. This is really distracting and very inefficient! Time and concentration are your most precious resources while coding.\nThe answer to the long build times is simple: make the compiler build less code! Sounds reasonable, but how can we achieve this? The answer is by using iOS frameworks to compartmentalize our code into smaller, more discrete chunks of functionality.\nIn this example, we will start with the main app module and add a framework that contains some UI functionality that makes up a feature which we will integrate into our app.\nIt may not seem obvious with such a small example, but the advantages of developing in this way are huge. They are especially big when you have to build functionality into a large app that has a lot of legacy components.\nBy building features as separate modules that are highly independent of the main app module, you can focus more on the features you want to create. You will notice being forced to organize your code in a way that exposes only what is necessary to the app module, the code tends to be much cleaner and well thought out, and it\u2019s less likely to develop into a spaghetti mess because it\u2019s more difficult to do so.\nAn essential step in building features as frameworks is to create a \u201cwrapper app\u201d, much like we will do in this tutorial, that minimally integrates the functionality you\u2019ve created into a tiny app. This app won\u2019t have to build all the other dependencies necessary for your main app module, so your build times will be lightning fast.\nYou will need to create a workspace for your app and the framework where your feature will live. Start by clicking File -> New -> Workspace in Xcode. Create a new folder where you want to save the workspace.\nAfter saving, we now have a blank workspace. Now click File -> New -> Project in Xcode and select \u201csingle view app\u201d.\nName your project \u201cSimpleCounterApp\u201d and make sure \u201cSwift\u201d is selected as the app language. It\u2019s named like this because it will just include the app module.\nAt the next step, select the folder where the SimpleCounter.xcworkspace is saved. Under \u201cAdd to\u201d select the SimpleCounter workspace. SimpleCounter.xcworkspace has to be opened in Xcode to show this option.\nCreate the project and notice now we\u2019ve got a project that looks pretty boring.\nLet\u2019s get to making a framework! We will integrate our feature into the main app in a later step, so there\u2019s no need to do anything now with it.\nClick File -> New -> Project again and this time, select \u201cCocoa Touch Framework\u201d as the template.\nName the framework SimpleCounterFeature and click next. On the next screen, select the folder where the .xcworkspace file is saved so that the framework and app are in the same root directory. Then, under \u201cAdd to\u201d, again select the SimpleCounter workspace. Under \u201cGroup\u201d select the root workspace node.\nThis will add the framework to the workspace, rather than the app module. Save the project. You should now have a workspace that looks like this:\nIn the schemes list, you should also have two schemes, one for the framework and one for the app.\nBecause this framework template is totally bare-bones, it doesn\u2019t come with any dependencies linked with it. So we need to add the basics, starting with UIKit.\nNavigate to the project settings for the framework and select Build Phases. Under Link Binary with Libraries, click the + button and link the UIKit and Foundation frameworks. Your build phases screen should look like this:\nNow, let\u2019s add a simple view controller with a nib to the framework. Click File -> New -> File and select \u201cSwift File\u201d. Click \u201cNext\u201d.\nName the file CounterViewController and add the file to the group SimpleCounterFeature. This will not be selected by default.\nNow you have a file that is part of the SimpleCounterFeature framework target. Do the same thing again with a nib file (\u201cView\u201d template in the \u201cNew File\u201d dialog), making sure to add it to the SimpleCounterFeature group.\nWhen writing code that you want to expose to the app module from your framework, it\u2019s important to keep in mind what access level you give your interfaces. We don\u2019t really concern ourselves normally with public, open or internal access levels when writing Swift code for an app module. That\u2019s because all the code lives in the same module, making the distinction less important. In a module, internal is the default access level for member properties and methods, meaning they are available across the module by default.\nWhen developing frameworks, it\u2019s different. Because the code you write will be packaged into a separate binary to be used by a module outside its scope, access levels are more relevant.\nIf you want to expose anything to the outside, whether it\u2019s a struct, protocol, class, or any property or method, you need to specify a public access level. If you don\u2019t, the entity will not be visible to the module that imports it. The Swift docs have a great explanation about access control that you may read a bit differently having completed this tutorial.\nFor example, in our CounterViewController class, we need to expose the class to be public if we want to be able to use it outside the framework module:\nThe member IBOutlet properties will not be visible outside the module since they are marked as internal.\nI won\u2019t go into detail about how to wire up the nib to the view controller, or how to add the rest of the counter functionality, as there\u2019s nothing special here. If you\u2019re interested, you can check out the sample project to see how it\u2019s done. In interface builder, I just created a button and a label and hooked them up to the IBOutlets and added some simple functionality.\nNow go to the General section of the project settings for the app module. Under Embedded Binaries, click the + button and add the SimpleCounterFeature.framework.\nThis adds the framework to the Embedded Binaries for the app module and links it. Adding the framework to the Embedded Binaries is needed because your SimpleCounterFeature framework isn\u2019t available to iOS like UIKit is, meaning it needs to be copied into the app bundle during build time.\nNow build the SimpleCounterApp scheme. If it built successfully, you are ready to start integrating your framework!\nBefore we integrate the view controller into your app module, we need to do some cleanup first. Start by deleting the Main.storyboard file and deleting the Main Interface entry in the General tab of the app module\u2019s project page.\nYou can also delete the ViewController.swift file in the main app module, too. You won\u2019t be using this.\nIn the AppDelegate.swift file, import the SimpleCounterFeature framework and create a UIWindow with the root view controller as the CounterViewController.\nNow, build your app. It should build successfully and launch with the CounterViewController as the root.

Outline Icons: Which Are Faster to Recognize?", "tags": ["icons", "mobile", "ux", "design", "ui"], "reading_time": 6, "text": "When building a mobile app, there comes a time when you have to decide whether to use solid or outline icons. Which style is better for user experience?\nSome think the difference between them is just a matter of preference, but research shows there\u2019s more to it than that\u2013one style has a faster recognition rate than the other.\nKnowing when to use solid or outline icons will make it easy for your users to navigate your mobile app. They\u2019ll be able to recognize your icons faster and select the right options.\nA research study, \u201cFilled-in vs. Outline Icons: The Impact of Icon Style on Usability,\u201d discovered that icon style affects task performance. Task performance was measured by the speed and accuracy of recognizing and selecting icons.\nSolid icons were generally faster to recognize than outline icons, but with a few exceptions. And some icons showed no difference in task time. This has to do with characteristic cues.\nCharacteristic cues are what users use to identify icons. If characteristic cues are absent or hard to notice, the icon becomes unidentifiable.\nFor example, the tail of a comment bubble icon is its characteristic cue. Without it, it\u2019s simply a circle. The keyhole on a lock icon is its characteristic cue. Without it, it\u2019s easy to mistake the icon for a bag. The teeth on a cog icon is its characteristic cue. Without it, it looks like a doughnut.\nThe lock icon used in the study had no keyhole and was the most misidentified icon with over a quarter of all failures. The keyhole is a necessary characteristic cue because without it the icon looks like a bag, purse, or even a pot.\nThese characteristic cues are what users rely on for icon recognition. When using icons, make sure it includes all the characteristic cues users need to identify them. If an icon could look like a different object, consider adding extra characteristic cues to it.\nIn addition to including characteristic cues, the cues must be salient or easy to notice. Sometimes the characteristic cues on certain icons are more salient in an outline style than solid style.\nThe study found three icons that were faster to recognize in outline style\u2013comment bubble, trash can, and key. These icons have subtle characteristic cues that appear on the outer edges of the shape. Because of this, an outline style makes those cues easier to notice.\nThe comment bubble tail is easy to miss as a solid, but more apparent as outlines. The trash can lid is hard to notice in solid style, but more visible in an outline one. The key teeth are subtle, but the jagged edges are more distinct in an outline style.\nWhen an icon\u2019s characteristics cues are subtle and appear on the edges of a shape, use an outline style. This makes the cues more salient which results in faster recognition.\nWhen choosing icons, it\u2019s best to stick to a consistent style. Instead of mixing solid and outline styles, try to choose a set of icons that have salient characteristic cues with sharper angles that point outward.\nFor example, if you compare the comment, trash can, and key icon to ones with more salient cues you can see the difference. The more salient cues jut out and are easier to notice.\nMost icons represent physical objects in the real world. These objects are in a solid form and appear as silhouettes. Viewing icons as outlines is not a realistic representation of what most are used to seeing. This is why solid icons are faster to recognize.\nDespite this, users are still able to recognize outline icons. But it\u2019ll take them longer to do so if the icon\u2019s shape outlines are too close together.\nThe study found that the thumb, scissors, phone, and tools icon were faster to recognize in a solid style. This is because the outline style of these icons all have narrow inner spacing on their cues that create visual noise.\nIt\u2019s best to use solid icons for objects that have a narrow inner spacing. The silhouette form offers a simpler shape, making the icons more identifiable.\nThe study found icons that were easy to recognize in either style. For example, the star, shopping cart, and flag icon all had similar recognition times.\nThis means the outline style for these icons didn\u2019t slow users down. The reason is due to the wide inner spacing they have that reduces visual noise. The more narrow the inner spacing is, the more noise it creates, which interferes with recognition.\nIt\u2019s common practice to use a solid icon to highlight the active button in a tab bar, while the other buttons remain in outline form. But this design practice is backward and should be the other way around.\nUsers need more recognition speed on options they haven\u2019t discovered yet, not on the one they have already selected it. A solid icon for the active button isn\u2019t necessary. It\u2019s more important for the inactive buttons to get solid icons.\nUse an outline icon to highlight the active button, not a solid icon. It offers a clearer change in style and color that reinforces the selected button.\nIf task speed is important to your users, the icon recognition rate must be considered. And if you want a faster recognition rate, solid style icons are better. But there\u2019s an exception to this rule that you should keep in mind. Knowing the exception to the rule allows you to make use of outline styles when the situation fits.\nIn summary, here\u2019s what you should keep in mind when using icon styles:\nOriginally published at uxmovement.com on February 20, 2019.\n", "link": "https://medium.com/@uxmovement/solid-vs-outline-icons-which-are-faster-to-recognize-9bb0fc24821f", "author": "UX Movement", "comments": [], "claps": "6.7K claps"}, {"num_comments": 1, "title": "5 Techniques to Make Mobile Call to Action Buttons Intuitive", "tags": ["button", "ux", "visual design", "ui", "mobile"], "reading_time": 6, "text": "To tap or not to tap \u2014 that is the question on the user\u2019s mind when they see a call to action button.\nThe more buttons there are, the longer it takes them to make a decision. They have to examine each button to determine which one best meets their goal. Any uncertainty or doubt about the buttons could cause them to take no action or the wrong action.\nYou can prevent this by making the priority of each action intuitive. When users can see which button is important to their task, they\u2019re able to take action right away. There are a few UX techniques you can use to make a big difference on the intuitiveness of your call to action buttons.\nOne common mistake made on apps is placing buttons in an order that diverts from the user\u2019s natural scanning pattern. They place their highest priority button first because they want users to notice it first. But users will notice the button regardless of the order as long it carries visual weight.\nButton order is not to aid visibility, but to aid efficiency. Placing the high priority button first causes users to reverse their scanning direction from top-down to bottom-up, which breaks their natural flow.\nInstead of forcing users to rescan buttons, allow them to get to the high priority action with a scan in a single direction. This allows users to scan every button option in order before they make a decision.\nBy placing the high priority action at the bottom, it\u2019s in the path of least visual resistance which makes it quick and easy to tap. Also, the bottom location is the easiest for the finger to reach, which further improves efficiency.\nAnother mistake made on apps is using text only to represent a button. Designers use text buttons to show which actions are lower priority. But this is a poor choice for call to actions because the text doesn\u2019t have the appearance of a button. This can cause users to overlook those actions and only see the primary one.\nText buttons also cause confusion by making users wonder if the text is a button or information. This uncertainty can lead them to skip those buttons.\nNot only are text buttons confusing, but they\u2019re also smaller tap targets. Placing the text label inside a button shape makes the call to action easier to notice and tap.\nButton shapes are a better way to subdue low priority actions than text buttons. They make every option easy to recognize for users to meet their goal in their preferred way.\nThe high priority action is easiest to identify \u2014 it\u2019s the action that leads directly to the user\u2019s goal. If you\u2019re unsure about the remaining actions, think about which one progresses users toward their goal and which one regresses them.\nIn the example, \u201ccheckout\u201d has high priority because it takes users to their goal. But it\u2019s not as clear which action has medium priority \u2014 \u201cview cart\u201d or \u201ckeep shopping\u201d.\nThe \u201cview cart\u201d action takes users to view the items they added to their cart, which then leads to checkout. The \u201ckeep shopping\u201d action takes users back to the product pages further away from the checkout option.\nBy examining the actions, it\u2019s clear that \u201cview cart\u201d has a medium priority and \u201ckeep shopping\u201d has a low priority. It\u2019s easy to see which action progresses users toward their goal and which one regresses them from it.\nProgressive actions are always higher priority than regressive ones. As such, they deserve more visual weight and higher color contrast.\nColor is an effective way to denote progressive actions because it stands out from the text color and grabs the user\u2019s attention. When the color of the button is the same color as the text, the signal is not as strong. Adding a distinct color to progressive actions signifies the action users should take.\nIf you use the same color for each progressive action, users won\u2019t know which one has higher priority. And using different colors for each one would only confuse users more and cause them to wonder what the different colors mean. Not only that, but it would also give each button the same visual weight.\nThe trick is to use the same hue but vary the saturation and brightness on the medium priority action so that it looks lighter than the high priority action. Now the weight of the buttons are no longer competing and there\u2019s a clear winner.\nTo enhance the contrast more, you can invert the display polarity. Use light text on a dark background for the primary button and dark on light for the secondary one. This gives the high priority action a brighter text label and the highest contrast.\nApplying the current techniques is enough to distinguish priority, but there\u2019s more you can do. The more intuitive you make each button the less the user has to think.\nUsing the same boldness on each text label puts the same amount of emphasis on them. It\u2019s better to emphasize each text label differently based on priority. Vary the boldness of the text labels so that high priority buttons are the boldest and low priority buttons are the least bold. This way the weight of the text labels even indicate priority when users read them.\nThe example shows you how the \u201ccheckout\u201d label is bolder and brighter than the rest. The \u201cview cart\u201d label is semibold and \u201ckeep shopping\u201d label is medium. As a result, the text labels reflect the visual weight of each action. The text indicating \u201c3 items\u201d in the \u201cview cart\u201d label isn\u2019t bolded because it\u2019s supplemental information that doesn\u2019t represent the action taken.\nThe last technique is the cherry on top that will make your buttons accessible to color blind users. Color blind users won\u2019t be able to tell the difference between the weight of buttons. They need something more than color to serve as a visual cue.\nGiving the high priority action an icon adds the extra emphasis to set it apart. When users scan, they often fixate on visual elements more than text. The icon ensures that all users will pay more attention to the high priority action than the other ones.\nIf you removed the color and label, users would still be able to recognize the checkout button. The icon communicates checkout as well as the text does.\nYour buttons aren\u2019t intuitive if users are spending a long time on the action screen, or if you\u2019re getting a low click through rate. If this is the case, use these techniques to sharpen the UX of your call to action buttons. You\u2019ll see a big difference in the before and after version.\nOriginally published at uxmovement.com on March 13, 2019.\n", "link": "https://medium.com/@uxmovement/5-techniques-to-make-mobile-call-to-action-buttons-intuitive-a4d0bb49b212", "author": "UX Movement", "comments": [], "claps": "1.1K claps"}, {"num_comments": "unspecified", "title": "Beam Wallet for iOS is out on Mainnet! \u2013 BEAM-MW \u2013 Medium", "tags": ["ios", "wallet", "mobile", "mimblewimble", "cryptocurrency"], "reading_time": 3, "text": "April 22, 2019\nThe long-awaited Beam Mobile Wallet for iOS is now available for free on the App Store.

I spent that entire two decade span coveting a byline from them, keeping all of my old editions, spines cracked and pages torn from multiple readings, as if stockpiling a history of issues would bring me closer to seeing my name in one eventually.\nI first pitched them about ten years ago but nothing came of it, and for the next few years I waffled back-and-forth on a variety of other topics but nothing felt appropriate.\nThen, last summer, in the wake of two closely related deaths of celebrities, I had a hook on a topic I had been wanting to write about for years and decided this magazine was the perfect home for it.\nWithin hours of my pitch I had a response:\nThis isn\u2019t right for our print edition, the digital content editor told me, but I\u2019d love to put it on the website. Only we can\u2019t pay for online-only content, so if that\u2019s a deal breaker I understand.\nI had to take a moment to ask myself is it a deal breaker? Are there ever times where it is acceptable to write for someone else without being paid for it?\nI\u2019ve been writing since childhood and blogging since the early aughts, and between those two experiences there is one piece of advice woven through the threads of time:\nNever write for free.\nAt the height of my blogging career, I would frequently work with brands on sponsorship initiatives. In exchange for either goods or a fee, I would write about their product, either as an online review or social media promotion, among other methods.\nIf we are going to be technical about things, by accepting product in lieu of monetary compensation, I was writing for free. Make no mistake on that. Still, sometimes the product was worth it \u2014 when a favorite company wants to send you free items on a monthly basis and all you have to do is talk about a product you are already using, it\u2019s hard to say no to that.\nBlog monetization is a cottage industry unto itself, with high-profile bloggers parlaying their platform into books and podcasts and other mediums. Advertisement touts spread across the internet, sponsorships and ambassadors are everywhere as brands court the belles of the blogging ball. Myself included.\nAt the peak of the blogging bubble, sponsored content became so prevalent that online algorithms were set up to determine how much a blogger should charge for a blog post or social media mention and those metrics are still used to this day, as the hashtag #ad gains prevalence on Twitter and Instagram. Endorsements have become such an intrinsic part of our online experience that several years ago the FTC set out guidelines to make sure social media followers knew that the person posting about a particular product was being compensated in some way.\nI know my worth as a writer \u2014 not just as a blogger, but as a writer although to me they are inherently the same thing. When brands came to me, pitching a product or sponsored content, I would present them with my fee. I had plugged my numbers into the online calculator, the number of impressions I got in a month and unique visitors and social media followers. This was then paired with the amount of time that would be spent on the requested content and a financial amount would be regurgitated and presented to the brand.\nMore often than not, the brands \u2014 be it small startups or large household names \u2014 would tell me they don\u2019t have a budget for payment, but they promise to amplify my post across social media platforms. I would be paid in exposure.\nSomehow they all seemed to miss the part where they came to me. They found me. So clearly I was already doing okay in the exposure department.\nMany of my blogging friends have put companies and brands on blast when they refuse or claim they are unable to pay with money and offer exposure instead. Exposure doesn\u2019t pay the bills after all and when these are multi-billion dollar companies it\u2019s hard to believe they don\u2019t have a line item in their advertising budget for something like this.\nThe answer is believed to be that these multi-billion dollar companies don\u2019t see the work we provide as having any true monetary value. We, as the writer or musician or artist, know our worth but to the outside world creative ventures are written off as hobbies or something people merely dabble in, not a serious business pursuit. We should be happy to put our art out into the world and have it been seen and heard and read. That should be enough for us.\nHonestly, for me, sometimes it is enough. Which is why, when the major glossy magazine I\u2019ve been reading for years offered me a byline on their website that they would put out to their 70K Twitter followers and 160K Facebook likes and not pay me, I happily accepted those terms.\nNot only did I happily accept those terms once, I\u2019ve since published another piece with them on their website for free and am sure to pitch them again.\nWriters don\u2019t write for money. If that\u2019s why you are getting into this game, I suggest you reconsider your motives. We publish on Medium without any monetary guarantee because we have ideas and thoughts we want to put out there into the world. We have things we want and need to say, regardless of whether or not we\u2019ll make any money off of those ideas.\nWould I love to be paid what I\u2019m worth (or, even better, more than I\u2019m worth) every single time I publish an essay? Obviously. Have I been paid my worth by other publications? Yes. Am I sometimes okay not being paid in exchange for a coveted byline? Absolutely. Because I do know my worth and I know that my writing is at a level high enough to appear in certain publications. And some publications are priceless.\n", "link": "https://writingcooperative.com/why-i-sometimes-write-for-exposure-1bce43e49c64", "author": "Jill Grunenwald", "comments": [], "claps": "101 claps"}, {"num_comments": 109, "title": "The 4 Best Ways to Earn Income Writing in 2018 (and the 3 Worst)", "tags": ["money", "blogging", "writing", "success", "self improvement"], "reading_time": 9, "text": "In the past month, I\u2019ve made more money from my writing than the previous 4.5 years combined.\nIn 54-ish months, I made a grand total of $40ish dollars. I miraculously sold a few cheap eBooks, and...that was it.\nI was profoundly frustrated \u2014 I was spending hundreds of hours writing hundreds of posts that got virtually 0 views, 0 followers, and made just enough to buy a Ring Pop every once in a while.\nBut in the past 8 months, everything changed. Now, I\u2019m earning income from so many income streams I sometimes forget where it all comes from. I\u2019m not saying that to brag \u2014 I marvel that I\u2019m actually making a living as a writer. I still can\u2019t believe it sometimes.\nDon\u2019t make the same mistakes I did for 54 months. Here are the 4 best ways to earn income writing in 2018.\nI\u2019m amazed how few writers are doing this.\nIn about 90 seconds, you can register with Amazon\u2019s affiliate program (just insert your bank and tax information because Amazon deposits your earnings directly into your bank).\nAfter that, you can paste links to any product on Amazon, and get anywhere from a 3% \u2014 10% cut if anyone buys the product from your link.\nHere\u2019s an example of my earnings:\nThis is how much I\u2019ve earned this year so far (top left). I exclusively link to books I quote in my articles, and I average about $100/month or so. Books aren\u2019t that expensive, so I don\u2019t earn a lot, relatively speaking (but it\u2019s a lot if you only earned $40 in your first 4 years!).\nAmazon affiliate links can be extremely lucrative, though. For instance, you could post an article like my friend Tim Denning did, reviewing purchases under $100 and linking to the products.\nAnother example: uber-successful entrepreneur Tim Ferriss sends out a weekly email with his \u201cfavorite purchase of the week.\u201d Sometimes it\u2019s a nutrition bar, sometimes it\u2019s expensive workout equipment. A growing email list is an excellent audience for those links.\nWith Amazon affiliate links, you get a cut from everything. They\u2019re simple, subtle, unobtrusive, and very lucrative if done right.\nIf you haven\u2019t heard by now that you can earn money posting articles on Medium, you\u2019ve been living under a rock.\nOnce you become a Medium member ($5/month subscription), you\u2019re eligible to post \u201cmembers-only stories,\u201d which can earn income.\nMedium releases monthly reports to paying members about this income. This past month, they informed me 56% of writers who posted a \u201cmembers-only\u201d story made money (an average of $58 dollars) \u2014 over half of writers made money! One author made over $1,100 dollars from a single article.\nMedium is the only platform on the Internet right now that allows anyone to sign up, post an article, and get paid earnings immediately.\nI actually don\u2019t post a lot of members-only articles, but here\u2019s what I earned last month from a single article I wrote:\nYou might not start off getting hundreds of dollars for a single post. But one of my first paid posts earned over $450. From a single post!\nSome friends of mine like Tom Kuegler and Niklas Goeke are making substantially more than I am through writing many members-only posts per month. Study those guys and see what they do. I promise you, they know what they\u2019re doing.\nOnline courses are great. Automated online courses are even better.\nWhen you subscribe to my email list, you\u2019re sent to a page that automatically plays a video pitching my $28 online course. I get about 1\u20133 sales per day (sometimes 5\u20136). The course is self-led, which means I\u2019ve removed myself from the process \u2014 the definition of passive income.\nHere\u2019s a screenshot of the income for that particular course from the past few months. I wake up every morning and almost always see an increase. There\u2019s nothing quite like waking up and seeing you made a few hundred bucks while you slept.\nAuthor Derek Sivers once said, \u201cWhat is obvious to you is amazing to others.\u201d If you can give people an easy-to-understand solution to a problem they have, they\u2019ll pay for you for it. If you can automate it, you\u2019re miles ahead of the game.\nIf you\u2019re like me, it\u2019s the technical part that scares you. But actually plugging in the content to an online course is the easy part! If you already have the content, you\u2019re over half done.\nI\u2019ve found that I don\u2019t prioritize coaching as much as others; I prefer teaching larger groups in class-and-course settings. However, 1-on-1 (and group) coaching is an extremely common and popular way to make money as a writer.\nHere\u2019s the most important truth I\u2019ve learned about coaching:\nPeople aren\u2019t paying you for coaching, they\u2019re paying you for a result.\nIf you can get people the result they want \u2014 a bigger email list, more views, a book deal, how to get from \u201cA\u201d to \u201cB\u201d \u2014 you can charge practically whatever you want. These results are priceless.\nSome writers I know charge $200 for a coaching package; others charge $2,000. If you can provide the results your clients want, you can charge whatever you\u2019d like.\nGetting clients isn\u2019t that difficult, either. An easy way is to simply let your readers know:\nMy friend Tom Kuegler observed that perhaps 30\u201340% of webinar signups actually attend the webinar, and 20\u201330% of attendees might buy the product. If you only get 50 signups and offer a $200 coaching package, that could be about 3 clients.\nThere are lots of ways to earn income as a writer, but in 5 years of writing, these are the 3 absolute worst and ineffective ways I\u2019ve found to earn income.\nThe ultimate dream of many writers doesn\u2019t come with a lot of money.\nProlific author James Altucher has written nearly 20 books. In his most recent, Choose Yourself, he confirmed that actual book deals didn\u2019t make him a lot of money. He explained he earned about $50,000 total from one of his best-selling books \u2014 nothing to scoff at, but no fortune, either.\nI recently signed my first book deal. It feels amazing. I\u2019m going to be a published author!\nBut I\u2019ve learned that an average cut from traditionally-published books is only about 10% \u2014 15%. Even with a modest advance, that\u2019s not a lot. Self-publishing can be more lucrative, but even selling 10,000 books (a monumental feat for most new writers) at $10 will only give you around $50,000 after taxes, royalties, and cuts from places like Amazon.\nA top-tier, high-quality book takes a long time to write; some of the best full-time authors I follow can only publish 1 book per year.\nWriting books obviously isn\u2019t a bad idea. But in terms of earning income, they\u2019re one of the least viable options.\nThe most important truth I\u2019ve learned about books is that they\u2019re a platform to earn income from other projects \u2014 related online courses, coaching, and seminars, etc.\nMy dad, bless his heart, still asks me why I don\u2019t have any banner ads or other advertisements on my blog or in my articles.\nAds used to work (if only a little). But not anymore.\nI hate ads. I hate them. I never click on them, ever. Most people don\u2019t, either.\nAds work like most affiliate links do \u2014 if a reader clicks on the ad and buys the product, you get a little cut.\nBut hardly anyone reads blogs anymore. Unless you have an enormous readership for your personal blog (I\u2019m talking about 10,000+ views/day), ads aren\u2019t going to earn you any noticeable income.\nReaders today are only satisfied with high-caliber, top-quality content that provides immense value. Then, when you build enough trust with them (what Gary Vaynerchuk calls \u201cjab, jab, jab, right hook\u201d), you can pitch them a product.\nBut ads don\u2019t work anymore. No one wants them, no one clicks them, and the income you earn is minuscule while you repel readers with ugly advertisements.\nSEO is dead.\nSome writers may fight me on this, and I\u2019d love to discuss it. But I worked for an SEO boutique firm for a year after college, and even in 2013 SEO was sinking. Trying to game Google and Facebook for viewers and scrollers simply isn\u2019t a viable option anymore.\nGoogle is constantly advancing their already-Zodiac-level algorithms to provide only the most relevant value for users, and paying more isn\u2019t helping your ads get more clicks anymore.\nSame for Facebook; they\u2019ve openly stated they\u2019re moving away from updates from \u201ccompanies\u201d and more from friends and family on your newsfeed.\nIf you can write amazing, incredible content full of value that people will read, Google will heavily favor you more than mediocre writers\u2019 advertisements \u2014 even if their wallet is bigger than yours.\nDon\u2019t focus on gaming the system; focus on writing better.\nI\u2019m not including Patreon in this; although I\u2019ve heard mixed reviews of it, I know some writers are making decent income asking for donations through Patreon.\nWhat I am talking about is gimmicky pitches like \u201cbuy me a coffee!\u201d or \u201cdonate $5 towards my hosting fees!\u201d\nPerhaps these strategies work, but what I\u2019ve seen isn\u2019t encouraging. I\u2019ve seen writers with well over 100,000 followers who experimented with a \u201cbuy me a coffee\u201d tipping strategy, but their public records of the donations showed only a handful of coffees per month.\nYou\u2019d do better to focus on other income streams.\nA lot of writers are wisely expanding into other mediums \u2014 video and vlogging are becoming more popular than ever.\nBut a huge mistake many writers make is trying to secure sponsors for their work.\nFor over 4 years, I pitched every big-name website out there \u2014 Forbes, Fast Company, Huffington Post, CNN, Business Insider, you name it. I even pitched small-to-mid-level bloggers, podcasters, authors, and writers to offer my guest posts.\nNo one ever responded.\nBut in the past 6 months, I\u2019ve been featured on these enormous sites. I post regularly to CNBC, Thought Catalog, Thrive Global, etc. My articles on Business Insider have been translated into several languages. I\u2019ve been invited to speak on podcasts, at conferences, and in writer summits.\nWhat changed?\nIt\u2019s simple: I invested a ton of effort, time, and money into becoming an elite writer. Then, everyone came to me.\nThe truth is, no one wants your pitches. Instead, you should, as Steve Martin famously said, \u201cBe so good they can\u2019t ignore you.\u201d\nIn the words of author and CEO Russel Brunson:\nBrunson went on to say that there are only 2 reasons a buyer will stop buying from you:\nIf you can provide immense value for a reasonable price, you\u2019ll get customers.\nBut to get customers, you need to invest in yourself and focus on the right strategies. Writing has changed in the past decade; ads don\u2019t work anymore. SEO isn\u2019t a viable option.\nBetter to focus on learning tools like online course creation and unobtrusive affiliate links instead of putting in another year on your unfinished manuscript you\u2019ve never shown anyone, hoping for an instant best-seller and big paycheck someday.\nI spent over 4 years toiling in online mediocrity. My writing wasn\u2019t good, but I wasn\u2019t willing to invest in myself to get better. I didn\u2019t learn new skills. I stuck to the \u201ctraditional\u201d ways of making money online, which got me nowhere.\nYou don\u2019t have to waste 4 years like I did.\nIf you want to become a top-paid writer and gain 10x more readers, followers, and income, my free guide Wealthy Writers will help.\nClick here to get your free copy of Wealthy Writers now!\n", "link": "https://medium.com/the-mission/the-4-best-ways-to-earn-income-writing-in-2018-and-the-3-worst-16b486c19774", "author": "Anthony Moore", "comments": ["Steemit works like that too, although they\u2019re in the blockchina/crypto realm.

offers an amazing opportunity to build authority and earn income.\nYou can create a blog about anything you have knowledge about or experience in.\nThe key is to choose a niche and dive in \u2014 serving a specific audience is better than writing about a jumble of topics.\nWhether you want to focus on a business topic like growth marketing or a personal passion like a sport, choose a vertical and dive in.\nWith effort and time, your blog can grow into a real unicorn, generating income and positioning you as an authority in your space.\nHere, discover 12 ways your blog can turn a profit.\nYou can use your blog to position yourself as an expert in any field.\nTake Facebook marketing, for example.\nFacebook Messenger marketing and Messenger chatbots are on the rise and the marketing possibilities are endless.\nIf you\u2019re a digital marketing or social media consultant, leverage the buzz surrounding Facebook chatbots and create a blog that\u2019s all about using Facebook Messenger chatbots for businesses.\nPotential topics could include things like why chatbots are great for business, how to set up a chatbot, how to use it to capture leads, the lower cost for click-to-messenger ads, etc.\nOver time, you can use your blog to build authority as a Facebook chatbot expert.\nWith a blog as your base, you can successfully add a chatbot consultancy to your business.\nAdd a script from AdSense to display ads on your blog.\nEver a visitor clicks on those ads, you can net money.\nIf you can drive enough traffic and generate clicks, that money can really start to add up!\nPeople tend to be turned off by blatant, glaring ads.\nNative advertising seeks to solve that by making ads blend in with the media being viewed.\nUnlike banner ads, native ads don\u2019t look like ads, so they don\u2019t put people off as much.\nFor example, a native ad might populate in the sidebar with organic articles, making it more palatable (and clickable) to your site visitors.\nAs your blog grows, you can offer sponsored blog opportunities.\nWith enough traffic, your blog becomes a hot commodity that people will actually pay to be featured on.\nA company can pay you to write and talk about their products to promote them to your readers.\nYou can reach out to companies with a one-page media kit to pitch your blog.\nYour media kit should show your traffic statistics, social media following, demographics, and so on.\nBanner ads and sponsored posts can be pretty effective, but video ads can potentially do more.\nYou can either create short video showcasing the product being advertised or use one provided by the company.\nVideo ads have more room for creativity, making them more interesting and engaging than banner ads.\nIf you have an email newsletter tied to your blog, you can sell ad space in your newsletters for extra income.\nThis is best if you have a sizeable mailing list with fairly high engagement rates.\nIf you get good at building successful blogs, flipping can become a good income source for you.\nPut up a blog for a niche, attract a sizeable reader base, and then sell that blog at a premium.\nThis is a great business idea for those who are into starting and growing blogs.\nAdding affiliate links in your posts is another great way to monetize your blog.\nAn advertiser can pay you a commission for each sale through that affiliate link.\nYou can also put up those affiliate links on your blog in banner ads and native ads.\nAs you become known as an expert in your niche (thanks to your blog), people will want more from you \u2014 and they\u2019re willing to pay for it.\nAfter building your blog, you can start offer coaching services.\nAs a coach, you can offer guidance, advice, and accountability in learning a skill or reaching a goal.\nSimilar to sponsored blog posts, you can put up sponsored posts in the social media channels associated with your blog.\nThis is best if you have a large social media following and focus more on visual content.\nAs your authority and expertise grow, consulting and coaching aren\u2019t the only things you can branch out into.\nThanks to your blog, you can also start to produce ebooks and online courses.\nThe ebooks and online courses can take a deeper dive into material that matters to your audience, or you can offer exclusive material through ebooks and courses that isn\u2019t available on your blog.\nOnce you\u2019ve established yourself as an expert and provided valuable content on your blog for free, people will be willing to pay a premium for more from you.\nMuch like displaying ads from Google AdSense, you can directly sell ad space on your blog.\nNot having to rely on Google as an intermediary means you can potentially earn more money for each ad.\nOriginally Published on Inc.com\n", "link": "https://medium.com/@larrykim/12-ways-to-earn-money-and-authority-by-blogging-febc9d21601b", "author": "Larry Kim", "comments": [], "claps": "76

"startup"], "reading_time": 3, "text": "It\u2019s a common question asked by many startup entrepreneurs: \u201cWhat should my metrics look like?\u201d After all, sometimes you think you are doing well, but when you go to pitch in front of venture capitalists and proudly tout all of your growth metrics, you walk away questioning the fundamental assumptions about your company. So how do you know if you are really doing well?\nTo understand the world of startup metrics, you first have to understand that metrics are just another form of statistics, and as Mark Twain once famously opined, \u201cThere are three kinds of lies: lies, damned lies, and statistics.\u201d If Mark Twain were around today and hanging out with tech entrepreneurs in Silicon Valley, he\u2019d probably update that quote to the following: \u201cThere are three kinds of lies: lies, damned lies, and metrics.\u201d So you get the idea \u2014 there are various ways to interpret metrics, and that is what often leads to misunderstandings between entrepreneurs and investors.\nTake, for example, Monthly Recurring Revenue (MRR), which has become a hallmark metric for determining how well a company is doing. Entrepreneurs tend to focus only on \u201crevenue,\u201d which is any and all cash coming through the door. Investors, however, focus on \u201crecurring revenue,\u201d which is typically subscription-based revenue that comes in every month. Recurring revenue is so crucial because it helps to show that you have a reliable, stable company that doesn\u2019t have to scramble for new customers every month.\nHere\u2019s just one example. A startup company in New York City launches a new product, and within three weeks, is doing $2K in MRR. Is that good? In some places in the world, that would be an incredible feat. But in New York City, it\u2019s much more debatable. Once you factor in office rent, and the cost of hiring a few developers, you might just be breaking even, if that.\nOr, how about a metric like \u201cconversions.\u201d You would think this would be a fairly binary proposition \u2014 a customer either converts or not. In other words, you either make the sale, or you don\u2019t. But this can be a tricky number to interpret if you are talking about app downloads. An entrepreneur might say a customer \u201cconverts\u201d every time a new app is downloaded. However, a venture capitalist might have a stricter interpretation of \u201cconversion.\u201d For example, a customer might \u201cconvert\u201d only after he or she has downloaded the app, registered with a valid email, and used the app at least twice. See? There\u2019s quite a lot of wiggle room here to define specific metrics.\nIn many ways, too, metrics depend on the stage you are in. In the launch stage, for example, you might be able to get away with metrics like \u201cwebsite visitors\u201d or \u201capp downloads.\u201d However, in the growth stage, key metrics to monitor would involve factors like Monthly Recurring Revenue. And, in the advanced startup stage, where you are scaling your business and already reached profitability, more traditional financial metrics (the kinds you hear Wall Street analysts jabbering about) might be the new norm.\nAs you can see, it\u2019s important to have your hands on the pulse of your industry. What metrics are your peers using? What metrics are investors talking about? Answering these two questions will help you find out how well you stack up against other companies at the same stage of growth and in the same industry.\n", "link": "https://medium.com/swlh/inside-the-world-of-startup-metrics-b7e837c0cfda", "author": "Tomer Dicturel", "comments": [], "claps": "379 claps"}, {"num_comments": 1, "title": "Why content, not tech, is king in podcasting \u2013 Hacker Noon", "tags": ["hackernoon top story", "podcast", "venture capital", "podcasting content", "podcasting tech"], "reading_time": 9, "text": "2019 has been an unprecedented year for exits in the podcast industry, driven by one company: Spotify. Spotify paid $340M to acquire content studio Gimlet and hosting platform Anchor in February, and last month purchased true crime content studio Parcast for an estimated $100M. A press release shortly after the first two acquisitions announced Spotify had \u201cline-of-sight on total spend of $400-$500M in multiple acquisitions\u201d for 2019, with planned further spend if the strategy paid off.\nThis acquisition activity is especially notable in a space with few prior exits \u2014 iHeartMedia\u2019s acquisition of Stuff Media (creators of How Stuff Works) for $55M was the largest previous exit. Podcasts also generate surprisingly little revenue \u2014 at least in the U.S. While a majority of Americans aged 12 and up have listened to a podcast, with 33% listening monthly, the industry is estimated to generate just over $500M in revenue for 2019. We\u2019ve previously written about how low this revenue is on a per listener basis, especially given podcast audiences tend to be high income and high engagement.\nAs venture investors, we\u2019ve struggled to reconcile the explosive consumer interest in podcasts with lagging revenue and exits, but it looks like this may finally be changing. It\u2019s been particularly surprising for us to see content studios, like Gimlet, Parcast, and HowStuffWorks, driving the exit activity \u2014 as next gen media companies more broadly have been struggling. In this article, we will explore what\u2019s getting funded versus what is exiting, why content companies are generating so much interest from acquirers, and what we\u2019ll be watching in the podcasting space through the rest of 2019.\nWe analyzed Pitchbook data and found 31 podcast companies that have raised venture funding from U.S. investors since 2012. These startups have raised a collective $482M, of which almost 70% ($328M) has gone to only three companies:\nMost of the venture funding in podcasting has gone towards technology platforms ($327M) versus content ($155M)*. Seven of the top ten most funded companies are consumer streaming apps, producer tools, or infrastructure platforms, while only three are pure content studios. This is unsurprising in the broader scope of venture funding, as investors have historically been most interested in tech platforms versus media companies.\n*This $155M towards content includes Luminary, which is a streaming app (tech) but is heavily focused on producing exclusive content. Excluding Luminary, content startups have raised only $55M.\nIn contrast to the tech-heavy funding activity, the largest returns thus far have come from content companies. We\u2019ve listed all the publicly announced podcast startup exits below \u2014 there has been an estimated $385M in disclosed exit activity from content startups, compared to $114.5M for tech platforms.\nWhy have content companies had the most valuable exits thus far, versus tech-focused podcast companies that should theoretically trade at higher valuations? We think it\u2019s because there are still a few major obstacles in the way of tech-focused companies, which typically either focus on consumer discovery/streaming or producer infrastructure and monetization. The last piece of the puzzle comes from the acquirers themselves, as the unique profile of the acquirers in the space today favors content startups.\nIt\u2019s also difficult for these apps to make great recommendations. There\u2019s an extremely long tail of podcast content, but most regular listeners consume a mix of \u201cTop 200\u201d shows (easily discoverable via Apple Podcasts chart) and niche content they find through friends or family. We\u2019re not denying there\u2019s an opportunity for algorithms to surface hidden gems, but right now, it feels like none of the smaller listening apps have enough user data to generate recommendations that are (1) high quality and (2) feel truly personalized \u2014 and we\u2019ve tried a lot of them! The bigger players in this space like Spotify, Pandora, and Apple also benefit from their learnings developing similar algorithms for music, making it harder for podcast startups to catch up.\nWhen it comes to infrastructure, these professional production companies don\u2019t often turn to startups. For hosting and analytics, many have internal tools they use for other content or are locked into legacy platforms like Blubrry and Libsyn. In advertising/monetization, deals for big shows are often negotiated individually or on a network level. Even VC or corporate-backed companies in podcast marketing/sales, like Cadence13 and Art19, focus on higher-touch relationships with larger producers and networks \u2014 and don\u2019t seem to be aimed at most of Apple\u2019s 600,000+ podcasters.\nThe exception to this rule, of course, is Anchor, which was part of Spotify\u2019s recent wave of acquisitions. Anchor aims to help non-professional podcasters host and monetize their shows, and was acquired only months after its Sponsorships product (an open ads platform) launched. Because of this, we feel it\u2019s too soon to tell how far ad revenue will really travel down the \u201clong tail\u201d of podcasts. However, given Anchor\u2019s huge library (as of early 2019, the company was powering 40% of all new podcasts), it makes more sense as an acquisition target for Spotify. We\u2019re curious to see whether Radio Public and Panoply\u2019s new ad marketplaces are similarly able to pick up steam.\nWhy is music streaming such a low margin endeavor? Most of the income goes to the artists and \u201cmiddlemen\u201d like record labels and publishers \u2014 historically, Spotify has paid out ~70% of revenue to these players. In contrast, podcasts are freely available (no associated royalties), which means Spotify can keep 100% of the ad revenue generated against this content. Spotify is heavily incentivized to get users to spend more time listening to podcasts, as it\u2019s their highest margin content.\n3. Music streaming services (e.g. Spotify, Pandora, Apple Music, Tidal, Amazon Music, and Deezer) are all competing for the same demographic, and we expect CACs to rise as these companies continue to pour money into customer acquisition. Exclusive podcast content may be one way for an app to differentiate itself from the pack. If the music listening experience is relatively similar between Spotify and Pandora, for example, but Spotify offers an exclusive podcast from your favorite influencer, you may pick Spotify.\nOne of the most heavily anticipated events in podcasting this year is the launch of listening app Luminary on April 23. The startup raised $100M in VC funding pre-launch, and has (tellingly) seemed to pursue a strategy of content over tech. Luminary\u2019s marketing campaigns thus far suggest the product will be a smooth-looking, if fairly standard podcast player \u2014 with all the emphasis placed on a slate of top-tier podcasters that will make Luminary-exclusive shows behind a $7.99/month paywall.\nWe also expect to see Spotify move podcast content behind the paywall \u2014 we wouldn\u2019t be surprised to see Gimlet and Parcast start producing Spotify-exclusive shows that stream early, ad-free, or even exclusively on Spotify Premium. We also expect to see other music streaming services, like Pandora, acquire their own podcast studios or networks to compete (Wondery is one potential candidate, as are Tenderfoot TV and Gen-Z Media). These efforts will also all likely be competitive with Luminary, and may push upstart podcast discovery or consumption apps to either develop their own original content (as Stitcher and Castbox have done) or pivot.\nWe also hope to see more acquirers emerge beyond Spotify. It seems like Apple would be a likely entrant, due to the popularity of its native app and 2017 acquisition of a podcast search startup, Pop Up Archive. And though Apple\u2019s historical strategy in gaming, music, and video has been to be a marketplace for content rather than a producer, this is quickly changing! However, Apple\u2019s interest in podcasting seems tepid \u2014 it hasn\u2019t helped podcasters monetize via ads (as YouTube did for video creators), and only recently added rudimentary analytics despite launching its app in 2012.\nOther companies trying to capture \u201cshare of ear\u201d are likely acquirers \u2014 think Pandora, Deezer, or Tidal. We also wouldn\u2019t be surprised to see Google make another acquisition in this space (after acquihiring the team behind 60dB in 2017), as the company launched a standalone podcast app last year and seems to be investing in the industry. And you can never rule out Amazon, particularly given the company is always looking for more use cases for Alexa and for exclusive content to put behind the Audible paywall.\n", "link": "https://hackernoon.com/why-content-not-tech-is-king-in-podcasting-d0ce3d177b72", "author": "Justine and Olivia Moore", "comments": [], "claps": "163 claps"}, {"num_comments": "unspecified", "title": "Zoom: An IPO Done Right? \u2013 James Stanier \u2013 Medium", "tags": [], "reading_time": 8, "text": "On March 22nd 2019, Zoom filed their S-1, the registration form in anticipation of their initial public offering (IPO).

In doing so they may have removed one of the key incentives that made startups different from working in a large company.\nFor most startup employee\u2019s startup stock options are now a bad deal.\nHere\u2019s why.\nWhy Startups Offer Stock OptionsIn tech startups stock options were here almost from the beginning, first offered to the founders in 1957 at Fairchild Semiconductor, the first chip startup in Silicon Valley. As Venture Capital emerged as an industry in the mid 1970\u2019s, investors in venture-funded startups began to give stock options to all their employees. On its surface this was a pretty radical idea. The investors were giving away part of their ownership of the company \u2014 not just to the founders, but to all employees. Why would they do that?\nStock options for all employees of startups served several purposes:\nThe mechanics of a stock option was a simple idea \u2014 you received an option (an offer) to buy a part of the company via common stock options (called ISOs or NSOs) at a low price (the \u201cstrike price\u201d.) If the company was successful, you could sell it at a much higher price when the company went public (when its shares were listed on a stock exchange and could be freely traded) or was acquired.\nYou didn\u2019t get to own your stock options all at once. The stock trickled out over four years, as you would \u201cvest\u201d 1/48th of the option each month. And just to make sure you were in the company for at least a year, with most stock option plans, unless you stayed an entire year, you wouldn\u2019t vest any stock.\nNot everyone got the same amount of stock. The founders got most of the common stock. Early employees got a smaller percentage, and later employees received even a smaller piece \u2014 fractions of a percent \u2014 versus the double digits the founders owned.\nIn the 20th century, the best companies IPO\u2019d in 6\u20138 years from startup (and in the Dot-Com bubble of 1996\u20131999 that could be as short as 2\u20133 years.) Of the four startups I was in that went public, it took as long as six years and as short as three.\nOne other thing to note is that all employees \u2014 founders, early employees and later ones \u2014 all had the same vesting deal \u2014 four years \u2014 and no one made money on stock options until a \u201cliquidity event\u201d (a fancy word to mean when the company went public or got sold.) The rationale was that since there was no way for investors to make money until then, neither should anyone else. Everyone \u2014 investors, founders and startup employees \u2014 was, so to speak, in the same boat.\nStartup Compensation Changes with Growth Capital \u2014 12 Years to an IPOMuch has changed about the economics of startups in the two decades. And Mark Suster of Upfront Capital has a great post that summarizes these changes.\nThe first big idea is that unlike in the 20th century when there were two phases of funding startups\u2013Seed capital and Venture capital\u2013today there is a new, third phase. It\u2019s called Growth capital.\nInstead of a startup going public six to eight years after it was founded to raise capital to grow the company, today companies can to $50M+ funding rounds is a deferring the need for an Initial Public Offering to 10 or more years after a company is founded.\nSuster points out that the longer the company stays private, the more valuable it becomes. And if during this time VC\u2019s can hold onto their pro-rata (fancy word for what percentage of the startup they own), they can make a ton more money.\nThe premise of Growth capital is that if that by staying private longer, all the growth upside that went to the public markets (Wall Street) could instead be made by the private investors (the VC\u2019s and Growth Investors.)\nThe three examples Suster uses \u2014 Salesforce, Google and Amazon \u2014 show how much more valuable the companies were after their IPOs. Before these three went public, they weren\u2019t unicorns \u2014 that is their market cap was less than a billion dollars. Before these three went public, they weren\u2019t unicorns \u2014 that is, their market cap was less than $ 1 billion. Twelve years later, Salesforce\u2019s market cap was $18 billion, Google\u2019s was $162 billion, and Amazon\u2019s was $17 billion.\nTo Suster\u2019s point, it isn\u2019t that startups today can\u2019t raise money by going public, it\u2019s that their investors can make more money by keeping them private and going public later \u2014 now 10\u201312 years. And currently there is an influx of capital to do that.\nFounders RuleThe emergence of Growth capital, and pushing an IPO out a decade or more, has led to a dramatic shift in the balance of power between founders and investors. For three decades, from the mid-1970s to the early 2000s, the rules of the game were that a company must become profitable and hire a professional CEO before an IPO.\nThat made sense. Twentieth-century companies, competing in slower-moving markets, could thrive for long periods on a single innovation. If the VCs threw out the founder, the professional CEO who stepped in could grow a company without creating something new. In that environment, replacing a founder was the rational decision. But 21st century companies face compressed technology cycles, which create the need for continuous innovation over a longer period of time. Who leads that process best? Often it is founders, whose creativity, comfort with disorder, and risk-taking are more valuable at a time when companies need to retain a startup culture even as they grow large.\nWith the observation that founders added value during the long runup in the growth stage, VCs began to cede compensation and board control to founders. (See the HBR story here.)\nStartup Stock Options \u2014 Why A Good Deal Has Gone BadWhile founders in the 20th century had more stock than the rest of their employees, they had the same type of stock options. Today, that\u2019s not true. Rather, when a startup first forms, the founders grant themselves Restricted Stock Awards (RSA) instead of common stock options. Essentially the company sells them the stock at zero cost, and they reverse vest.\nIn the 20th century founders were taking a real risk on salary, betting their mortgage and future. Today that\u2019s less true. Founders take a lot less risk, raise multimillion-dollar seed rounds and have the ability to cash out way before a liquidity event.\nEarly employees take an equal risk that the company will crater, and they often work equally as hard. However, today founders own 30\u201350 times more than a startup\u2019s early employees. (What has happened in founder compensation and board control has mirrored the growth in corporate CEO compensation. In the last 50 years, corporate CEO pay went from 20 times an average employee to over 300 times their compensation.)\nOn top of the founder/early employee stock disparity, the VC\u2019s have moved the liquidity goal posts but haven\u2019t moved the vesting goal posts for non-founders. Consider that the median tenure in a startup is 2 years. By year three, 50% of the employees will be gone. If you\u2019re an early employee, today the company may not go public until eight years after you vest.\nSo why should non-founding employees of startups care? You\u2019ll still own your stock, and you can leave and join another startup. There are four problems:\nThe End of the High-Commitment/High-Performance Work System?In the academic literature, the work environment of a startup is called a high-commitment/ high-performance work system. This is a bundle of Human Resources startup practices that include hiring, self-managing teams, rapid and decentralized decision-making, on-boarding, flexible work assignments, communication, and stock options. And there is evidence that stock options increase the success of startups.\nSuccessful startups need highly committed employees who believe in the goals and values of the company. In exchange for sharing in the potential upside \u2014 and being valued as a critical part of the team, they\u2019re willing to rise to the expectation of putting work and the company in front of everything else. But this level of commitment depends on whether employees perceive these practices to be fair, both in terms of the process and the outcomes.\nVCs have intentionally changed the ~50-year-old social contract with startup employees. At the same time, they may have removed one of the key incentives that made startups different from working in a large company.\nWhile unique technology or market insight is one component of a successful startup everyone agrees that attracting and retaining A+ talent differentiates the winners from the losers. In trying to keep companies private longer, but not pass any of that new value to the employees, the VC\u2019s may have killed the golden goose.\nWhat Should Employees Do?In the past the founders and employees were aligned with the same type of common stock grant, and it was the VCs who got preferential stock treatment. Today, if you\u2019re an employee you\u2019re now are at the bottom of the stock preference pile. The founders have preferential stock treatment and the VC have preferred stock. And you\u2019re working just as hard. Add to that all the other known negatives of a startups\u2013 no work-life balance, insane hours, inexperienced management, risk of going out of business, etc.\nThat said, joining a startup still has a lot of benefits for employees who are looking to work with high performance teams with little structure. Your impact likely be felt. Constant learning opportunities, responsibility and advancement are there for those who take it.\nIf you\u2019re one of the early senior hires, there\u2019s no downside of asking for the same Restricted Stock Agreements (RSAs) as the founders. And if you\u2019re joining a larger startup, you may want to consider those who are offering restricted stock units (RSUs) rather than common stock.\nWhat Should Investors Do?One possibility is to replace early employee (first ~10 employees) stock options with the same Restricted Stock Agreements (RSAs) as the founders.\nFor later employees make sure the company offers \u201crefresh\u201d option grants to longer-tenured employees. Better yet, offer restricted stock units (RSUs). Restricted Stock Units are a company\u2019s promise to give you shares of the company\u2019s stock. Unlike a stock option, which always has a strike (purchase) price higher than $0, an RSU is an option with a $0 purchase price. The lower the strike price, the less you have to pay to own a share of company stock. Like stock options, RSU\u2019s vest.\nBut to keep employees engaged, they ought to be allowed buy their vested RSU stock and sell it every time the company raises a new round of funding.\nLessons Learned\n\u2014 Venture Capital structures were set up for a world in which successful companies exited in 6\u20138 years and didn\u2019t raise too much capital\n\u2014 Venture capital growth funds are now giving startups the cash they would have received at an IPO\n\u2014 Investors and Founders have changed the model to their advantage, but no has changed the model for early employees\n\u2014 Large companies now have an opportunity to attract some of the talent that previously went elsewhere\nRead more Steve Blank posts at www.steveblank.com.\n", "link": "https://medium.com/@sgblank/startup-stock-options-why-a-good-deal-has-gone-bad-5e711d9819b7", "author": "Steve Blank", "comments": [], "claps": "676 claps"}, {"num_comments": "unspecified", "title": "Schro\u0308dinger\u2019s Valuation Problem \u2013 Noteworthy - The Journal Blog", "tags": [], "reading_time": 6, "text": "Startup Valuation \u2014 the Reality between Art and Science\n", "link": "https://blog.usejournal.com/schr%C3%B6dingers-valuation-problem-ec5bdbda63a0", "author": "Marc Penkala", "comments": [], "claps": "331"}, {"num_comments": "unspecified", "title": "20 Lines to Write Before Starting Your Pitch Deck \u2013 The Startup \u2013 Medium", "tags": [], "reading_time": 3, "text": "When getting ready to pitch VCs, founders often jump right into assembling a slide deck.

Meeting here, project here, dinner here.\nYou forget the minutes on the fringe of those hours. In some cases, you forget entire hours altogether. But just because you aren\u2019t utilizing them doesn\u2019t mean they don\u2019t matter.\nIn fact, what you do in your fringe hours determines as much of the outcomes of your life as what you do during your \u2018on\u2019 hours. This is because often, it is the micro-habits in our lives that create a bigger impact than the tasks we are conscious of. Small habits are easier to regularly engage in because we take them less seriously. Over time, it creates a much bigger impact than we can imagine.\nA great way to think about this is the classic question: would you rather have $1,000,000 in your bank account right now, or a penny that doubles in value for 31 days? Most people choose the million, but the penny actually results in a $10.7 million gain by the end of the month. The little things add up.\nIf you wrote 200 words a day every day, by this time next year, you\u2019d have a 73,000 word book.\nIf you walked for 30 minutes every day, by this time next year, you\u2019d have (by a conservative measure) a 27,375 calorie deficit. If you kept all other aspects of your life consistent, this would equate to an approximate 7.82 pound weight loss.\nIf you sent two query emails every day, either to a potential client, business lead, or job recruiter, by this time next year, you\u2019ll have logged 730 separate requests.\nIf you took 30 minutes each day to meditate, you\u2019d have been in a state of increased calm for 182 hours.\nIf you take one minute each day to think of three things you\u2019re grateful for, and you will have found 1,095 things to be thankful for each year.\nNow, let\u2019s think about it the opposite way \u2014 the time we are currently wasting:\nIt\u2019s not about trying to capitalize and profit off of every single moment of every single day. It is however, about realizing that you have more time than you think you do, and that you do not need large swaths of uninterrupted time to really accomplish something big.\nTake a period of time each day \u2014let\u2019s say one hour\u2014to complete your \u201cfringework,\u201d or the type of work that often gets left last on the to do list.\nFringework does not need to consist of the exact same things every day, but it\u2019s most effective when it does. Here\u2019s an example of some micro-tasks you could do during your \u201cfringework\u201d hour.\nTo determine what\u2019s best, use reverse engineering. Start with the end goals in your life, first. Do you want to feel more calm? More in control? Cleaner? More productive? Build a business? Be more responsive? Spend more time with family, or connecting to people? These end goals can help you determine what your fringe hour should be made up of.\nYou probably are aware of how you spend a 30 minute gap of your day, whether you\u2019re working, procrastinating, commuting or relaxing.\nYou probably at least somewhat know how you spend five minutes here and there.\nHowever, it\u2019s likely that you\u2019re totally blind to how you spend single moments, and it\u2019s there that the fringe work really adds up. To become more conscious of this, get an app that tracks how many times you open your social media accounts each day. You will probably feel shocked to learn that in the 130 times you opened Instagram, you could have been doing something far more productive.\nAnother way to ensure that you\u2019re utilizing your time more efficiently is to single-task. If something is a priority in your life, make it a priority. Turn off push notifications on your phone, close out of your email, put a \u201cdo not disturb\u201d sign on your door, even just for a few minutes.

And the first rule to being a really stellar doctor \u2014 listen to the nurses. They know things. All. The. Things.\nSometimes we know things we don\u2019t want to know.\nWe know the name of the first Human whoever coded and died on us. And the first child who did the same.\nWe know what all those things you watch on TV for fun \u2014 Grey\u2019s Anatomy, ER, House, etc...well..we know what they smell like. Blood has a smell. Trauma has a smell. The OR has a smell. Cancer has a smell. Terminal has a smell. A code has a smell.\nWe know how to use All. The. Things. The fancy gizmos. That\u2019s all us. From IV pumps to ICU monitors, to defibrillators, to playing PANDORA in the OR \u2014 we know how to run it and make it work when it decides to be fickle. We ARE tech support.\nWe know Death. Intimately. We\u2019ve held Death\u2019s hand. We\u2019ve played tug of war with Her. We have won some and we have lost more. We know how to care for bodies and exactly where the morgue is. We have held the living as they screamed out their grief and pain.\nWe know how to fight. For our patients. With physicians, with other departments, with our own management if we must. Almost always with insurance providers. We are the conscious of Healthcare \u2014 and trust me \u2014 no one loves you for that. We are advocates for our patients \u2014 to everyone else we are insubordinate bitches.\nWe know how to do what needs to be done. On the clock, off the clock, however long we have to be there to do it. The patients deserve our best. So we steal it from ourselves and our families to give it to them. Patients have no say about being sick \u2014 we know that. Every patient to us is someone\u2019s family. Maybe a member of our family one day \u2014 and we\u2019re putting some karma in the bank. Or perhaps we have already had that experience \u2014 a sick family member who was well cared for and now \u2014 we\u2019re paying it forward.\nEither way \u2014 nurses see a Human with a need. We always see Their Need before we see ours. No matter who they are.\nWe know how to juggle. Our lives, our families lives, our other commitments around crazy ass schedules, call, weekends, night-shifts, and holidays. We live our lives by our schedules. We need a day off? We ask for it months ahead of time. Or we work with each other to do the shift-shuffle to help each other out.\nWe know to cover each other\u2019s backs. Once you\u2019ve been a nurse long enough \u2014 you\u2019ve been betrayed and disappointed by management, physicians, the system. You lose trust in all those things. You develop a battlefield mentality and you only depend on your co-workers \u2014 other nurses. You look up one day and you realize \u2014 ALL your friends are nurses. All. Of. Them.\nWe know how to play hard. We learn to laugh. We develop unhealthy coping skills. Black Humor, sarcasm, drinking. I have yet to meet a nurse who doesn\u2019t drink. A lot drink wine on a regular \u2014 however a few \u2014 like me \u2014 found the hard stuff in nursing school and never looked back. Patron and I are good friends. Chilled \u2014 salt \u2014 orange. Get it right. Nurses are also good tippers. We know what hard work feels like.\nWe know we have an expiration date. We leave nursing because Our Bodies make us. Kidney stones from not hydrating during long shifts or being able to empty our bladders. High blood pressure from the stress, adrenaline, and cortisol surges. Migraines. Back injuries. Plantar Fascitis. Rotator cuff injuries. Knee replacements from arthritis. I could go on. Nurses regularly become patients.\nWe know all of this. We see all of this. Nothing changes.\nPoliticians continue to make speeches \u2014 and get it all wrong. They fuck with healthcare and never fix it. Our patients can\u2019t afford healthcare. And there aren\u2019t enough nurses for the patients who are in the system.\nAnd when nurses say \u201cThe Emperor isn\u2019t wearing any clothes\u201d \u2014 we are shouted down because we are \u2018just nurses\u2019. How could we know anything about the intricacies of the system?\nWe know this \u2014 insurance companies make more money than hospitals. We know they pay congress to help them keep the system broken.

How do you reign in hunger? We all think that eating more or eating more often will prevent hunger, but is this really true? Standard dietary advice is to eat 6 or 7 small meals per day with the hope that this will stave off hunger and prevent overeating. If you can prevent hunger, then you may also be able to make better food choices. On the surface, it seems pretty reasonable. However, on the surface, the disastrous Eat Less, Move More or Calories in Calories out paradigms also seemed pretty reasonable, too. Like fool\u2019s gold, appearances can be deceiving, and we must dig deeper to appreciate the truth, otherwise we are the fools. So, let\u2019s think about this a little more.\nThe most important determinant of how much you eat is how hungry you are. Yes, you can deliberately eat less, but you can\u2019t decide to be less hungry. So if you are constantly eating less, but are still hungry, it takes a toll on you, day after day, month after month, year after year. And the moment you let your guard down, you are going to eat more. You are constantly fighting with your own body. If you are less hungry, then you\u2019ll eat less. But you\u2019ll be working with your body, not against it.\nObesity, as I\u2019ve explained in my book, The Obesity Code, is not a disorder of too many calories. It\u2019s a hormonal imbalance of hyperinsulinemia. The main reason we eat more calories is not lack of willpower, it\u2019s hunger. And hunger and satiety are functions of our hormones. You can decide what to eat, but you can\u2019t decide to be less hungry. In the long term, it is the amount of hunger that determines how much you eat.\nOn the other side, \u2018Calories Out\u2019 is not primarily a function of exercise. It\u2019s determined mainly by the basal metabolic rate, which is the amount of energy (calories) required to keep our body in good working order. Energy is needed to generate body heat and to keep the heart, lung, kidneys and other vital organs working properly. You can exercise more, but you can\u2019t decide to have a higher metabolic rate. It doesn\u2019t work like that. And neither is the metabolic rate stable over time. It can fluctuate up or down 40% depending upon our hormones.\nFat accumulation, even from a Calories In, Calories Out standpoint is almost entirely a hormonal problem. It is not something that people \u2018decided\u2019 to do. Nobody decided they wanted to eat more so that they could get fat. They ate more because their hunger wasn\u2019t satisfied. And there are many different reasons for that \u2014 mental and physiological. But the bottom line is that obesity is not merely the lack of willpower or a bad choice that somebody made. It\u2019s a disease that deserves compassion. Cutting calories when the problem is hormonal is not going to work. And guess what? It doesn\u2019t.\nIs there any evidence to suggest that eating constantly will prevent hunger? That would be a big NO. Somebody made it up, and it\u2019s been repeated so many times that people assume it\u2019s true. Mostly, it\u2019s been promoted heavily by the snack food industry to make sure that people continue to buy their products. Up until the 1970s or so, people ate 3 meals per day \u2014 breakfast, lunch and dinner. It was unusual to snack and certainly not considered a healthy habit. It was an indulgence to be done very occasionally.\nEating constantly is sort of a nuisance. If you are trying to eat 6 or 7 times per day, then when are you supposed to get your work done? You are constantly thinking about what you need to eat and when to eat it. Anyways, it is clearly not necessary to snack because our body stores food energy (calories) as body fat for the exact reason of providing calories when needed. Body fat exists precisely so that we do NOT need to constantly eat. But is it useful to prevent hunger?\nLet\u2019s take some analogous situations. Suppose you need to urinate. Which is easier?\nOnce that first bit of urine come out, there\u2019s no stopping until it\u2019s done. It\u2019s incredibly hard to stop once you start. That\u2019s inertia. An object in motion tends to stay in motion until something else acts to stop it.\nLet\u2019s think about another situation. Suppose you are thirsty Which is easier?\nAgain, you and I both know that once you get that first sip, there\u2019s no stopping until the glass is empty. Once you start, it is easier to continue until satisfied, whether it\u2019s emptying your bladder or slaking your thirst. It\u2019s like my son. You can\u2019t ever get him into the bath. Once he\u2019s in, you can\u2019t ever get him out of the bath. But this is normal behaviour. So why do we assume this does not apply to eating?\nYou might believe that eating a small amount constantly or \u2018grazing\u2019 will prevent overeating. If this were true, what is the point of an appetizer? The hors d\u2019oeuvre is literally served \u2018outside the main meal\u2019. For what purpose do we serve an appetizer? Is the point to spoil our dinner so that we cannot eat what the host has slaved over all day because we are full? Really? No. The whole point of an appetizer is that this is a small tasty morsel to make us eat more. Eating a small, appetizing amount makes us hungrier, not less. The reason it works is because it overcomes that initial inertia. The appetizer starts us salivating and thinking about food and therefore our appetite increases.\nIn French, this may also be called an amuse bouche \u2014 meaning literally \u2018something that amuses the mouth\u2019. Why? So that we will eat more. It might be oysters, stuffed eggs or nuts. It\u2019s not served to fill you up so that you can\u2019t eat that expensive intricate meal prepared by the chef. Virtually all cultures in the world have a culinary tradition of whetting the appetite. The ancient Greeks and Romans stimulated their guest\u2019s appetite with little bits of fish, seasoned vegetables, cheese and olives. The Italian Renaissance writer Platina recommended thin rolls of grilled veal. Giving too large a portion would stimulate the satiety hormones, and dull the appetite. But a tiny portion almost paradoxically stimulates the appetite. This appetizing effect is no secret \u2014 being known to any person who has ever thrown a dinner party over the last 200 years.\nNow think about a time where you weren\u2019t really all that hungry, but it was breakfast time anyways. So, you eat because people have always said it\u2019s the most important meal of the day. To your surprise, as you start eating, you finished an entire meal relatively normally. Before you started eating, you could have easily skipped the meal and have been full. But once you started eating, you ate everything. Has this happened to you? It\u2019s happened to me many, many times, mostly because I\u2019m always aware of this fact. Eating when you are not hungry is not a good strategy for weight loss. Yet people are continually scolded for having the temerity to skip a single meal or snack. They are admonished to be sure to never miss a snack.\nIf we eat small meals 6 or 7 times per day, as most dietary authorities recommend, then what we are doing is giving ourselves appetizers but then deliberately stopping before we are actually satiated. And then repeating that multiple times per day. This is not going to decrease our appetites, it will increase it, a lot. Now because we are hungry but have not eaten our fill, we must exert a significant amount of willpower to stop ourselves from eating. We count our calories, but we don\u2019t count the willpower we\u2019ve spent to stop ourselves from eating. Day after day it goes on.\nEating WHETS the appetite. Got it? We\u2019ve known this for at least 150 years! Eating all the time so that you\u2019ll eat less soundsreally stupid, because it isreally stupid. Don\u2019t fall for it. If you hear a doctor or dietician giving you this advice, run far, far away, very, very quickly. They will literally kill you with this idiotic advice. So if eating more frequently gives you a bigger appetite, then the converse must be that eating less frequently gives you a smaller appetite. Luckily, this turns out to be true.\nFasting and Hunger\nGhrelin, originally purified in 1999 from rat stomachs, is the so-called hunger hormone. It strongly stimulates growth hormone, and increases appetite. So, if you want to lose weight on a long-term basis, you need to tune down ghrelin.\nSo, how to do that? In one study Patients undertook a 33 hour fast, and ghrelin was measured every 20 minutes. Here\u2019s what ghrelin levels look like over time.\nGhrelin levels are lowest at approximately 9:00 in the morning, the same time that studies of circadian rhythm indicate hunger is lowest. This is also generally the longest period of the day where you have not eaten. This reinforces the fact that hunger is not simply a function of \u2018not having eaten in a while\u2019. At 9:00, you have not eaten for about 14 hours, yet you are the least hungry. Eating, remember, does not necessarily make you less hungry.\nThere are 3 distinct ghrelin peaks corresponding to lunch, dinner and the next day\u2019s breakfast. This is not a coincidence, but indicates that hunger can be a learned response. We are used to eating 3 meals per day, so we begin to get hungry just because it is \u2018time to eat\u2019. But if you don\u2019t eat at those times, ghrelin DOES NOT CONTINUALLY INCREASE. After the initial wave of hunger, it recedes, even if you don\u2019t eat. Hunger comes as a wave. After it passes, it loses much of its power. Ghrelin spontaneously decreases after approximately 2 hours without food consumption. If you simply ignore hunger and don\u2019t eat, it will disappear. The average ghrelin levels over 24 hours of fasting decreases! In other words, eating nothing made you less hungry.\nWe\u2019ve all experienced this before. Think of a time that you were too busy and worked right through lunch. At about 1:00 you were hungry, but if you just drank some tea, by 3:00 pm, you were no longer hungry. Ride the waves \u2014 it passes. Same goes for dinner. Further it has been shown that ghrelin spontaneously decreases independently of serum insulin or glucose levels. Eating more sometimes makes you hungrier, not less. In the same vein, eating less can actually make you physically less hungry. That\u2019s terrific, because if you are less hungry, you will eat less, and are more likely to lose weight.\nThis same effect happens over multiple days of fasting. Over 3 days of fasting, ghrelin and hunger gradually decreased. Yes, you read that right. Patients were far LESS hungry when they didn\u2019t eat for three days. This jives perfectly with our clinical experience with patients undergoing extended fasting. They all expect to be ravenously hungry, but actually find that their hunger completely disappears. They always come in saying \u2018I can\u2019t eat much anymore. I get full so fast. I think my stomach shrank\u2019. That\u2019s PERFECT, because if you are eating less but getting more full, you are going to be more likely to keep the weight off.\nThere\u2019s also the substantial difference between men and women. There\u2019s only a mild effect for men, but women show a huge decrease in ghrelin. Women would be expected to have much more benefit from fasting because their hunger drops more. Many women have remarked how a longer fast seemed to completely turn off cravings. This may be the physiologic reason why.\nIntermittent and extended fasting, unlike caloric restriction diets, help to fix the main problem of weight gain \u2014 hunger. Ghrelin, the main hormonal mediator of hunger decreases with fasting, making hunger a manageable problem. We want to eat less, but be more full.\n", "link": "https://medium.com/@drjasonfung/controlling-hunger-part-2-5cca7562b8fe", "author": "Dr. Jason Fung", "comments": [], "claps": "1.1K claps"}, {"num_comments": 1, "title": "The future of healthcare: Carving out a new system from a broken one", "tags": ["healthcare", "design thinking", "healthcare technology", "service design", "trust"], "reading_time": 10, "text": "by Mari\u0301a Ana Barrera\nThis idea of invisibility has gained traction because of the digital era. You may not understand exactly what happens when you hit \u201cpay\u201d in an app on your phone, but you receive a text message from your bank letting you know Uber Eats (or any food delivery app) charged $25.00 to your credit card, and 35 minutes later there\u2019s a delivery person ringing your doorbell with your veggie poke, just in time for lunch. Without understanding how it all happens, this is a fairly common action we do every day without hesitation.\nAll in all, trusting invisibility goes beyond digital processes. It relates to trusting what you cannot see or understand. I don\u2019t need to know exactly how the back end of my bank, my phone, the restaurant, and Uber Eats are all connected. As long as the food arrives at my door on time and the amount shown is charged to my account, I\u2019m good. Most of us don\u2019t even check when companies like Amazon or Apple charge us because we know (or at least we think we know) that they wouldn\u2019t mess that up. We trust them.\nI recently watched technology researcher and author Rachel Botsman speak about the currency of trust. She touches on some great points. For example, how most conversations about trust revolve around the idea of transparency which, she says, is not always the answer (not that transparency is a bad thing; it just isn\u2019t the magical fix when there\u2019s a lack of trust). She also talks about how trust depends on the context, and most of all, on integrity and the alignment of actions and intentions. When I heard this, I was blown away and haven\u2019t stopped thinking about it. Wherever I go and whatever I do, I\u2019m constantly considering my interactions with services and people; whether there\u2019s trust or why there isn\u2019t; and how this defines my relationship with everything around me.\nIn this weird personal experiment, I found myself helping my mom navigate the healthcare system. As daughter, caregiver, patient advocate and, as you can imagine, researcher, I\u2019ve spent countless days understanding the reasons why it\u2019s too hard to trust invisibility in healthcare, and how, surprisingly, many people haven\u2019t lost faith in it. How is this even possible? Do patients blindly believe providers know best and unquestionably trust them?\nWhile in the hospital I stopped and looked around. I saw how patients heard what providers told them, and observed that most didn\u2019t ask any questions. They probably had a list of things they could ask, given the immense gap between how much providers know and how little we do. Beyond that, there\u2019s a huge issue in that the time spent with doctors is minimal, and understanding the complex language of medicine is not quick and easy (especially when you also need to process emotionally-intense information). Thanks to previous research, I\u2019m very aware that patients don\u2019t always understand what providers say, and still, they don\u2019t ask questions. On the other hand, patients are not completely honest with their providers, either because they feel ashamed, or because they don\u2019t offer up information that\u2019s not asked of them. I once heard Lorna Ross, Group Director at Fjord, say \u201cpatients don\u2019t know what they don\u2019t know\u201d (tricky, but deep). Patients don\u2019t know which information is important to share.\nThe relationship between patients and doctors goes a long way back. Doctors have been wizards, scientists, and saviors. They study hard to become experts, and they constantly train to address new conditions or understand new technologies, processes, and medications. I truly believe medical careers are tough and require tenacity, drive, and a thirst to be the best. After all, providers are in the business of saving lives. And as guardians of our health, they can be seen by patients as reliable figures who know it all. So, only a few patients question their medical team\u2019s decisions (please don\u2019t get me wrong, I\u2019m not advising to question medical judgment). I\u2019m honestly amazed that our relationships with providers, although not truly founded on honest and reliable information, are still fundamentally trustworthy.\nThen again, we \u2014 common people with scarce knowledge about medicine \u2014 can only trust what well-trained medical practitioners recommend. Knowing all they know, undeniably they are more capable of making informed decisions than we are. On our end, we blindly trust what they say, because we don\u2019t fully comprehend it all. (How can we? We\u2019re not the doctors!)\nDoctors are not the only players who interact with patients in the healthcare system. Sometimes, contradictions between players and their own interests distort the idea of trust. Here\u2019s a case study: Last year, while doing research for a health insurance company in Latin America, I was surprised to learn that pregnant women struggle with deciding whose advice to follow: Is the insurance company\u2019s recommendation to embark on natural childbirth the best birth plan? Or should they listen to their doctor and have a C-section? Torn between the two options they\u2019re forced to navigate this truth: Insurance companies may tell women that doctors prefer to schedule C-sections so they can have an organized schedule and charge higher fees. But doctors may tell women that it\u2019s the insurance companies that are the problem, and recommend natural childbirth because it\u2019s cheaper. In the end, women can\u2019t help but wonder who has their best interests in mind (it\u2019s the lucky person indeed who has a brother, a sister-in-law, or a next-door neighbor in the medical field).\nDuring my research, I noticed that we tend to think medical decisions are based on our best interests. But we don\u2019t grasp the idea of what our best interests are in the first place, because we don\u2019t tend to ruminate on them or work them out in detailed conversations with our medical practitioners. This creates a terrible cycle. So, the moment a woman is presented with a scenario in which she has a high probability of developing breast cancer, her doctors might suggest it\u2019s best to do a prophylactic mastectomy. Or, when she\u2019s been in an awful car accident, the doctors might take extreme measures to revive her. But what if that preventive surgery ends up with the body rejecting the breast implants? Or, what if those extreme measures leave her unable to breathe on her own?\nI know there are a million \u201cwhat if\u201d scenarios when it comes to health decisions. And that\u2019s one of the reasons why reflecting on what our best interests are is so important. Especially, considering that they might change in different circumstances. A married woman with no children who\u2019s diagnosed with a terminal condition could decide to spend her last days enjoying life to the fullest, whereas if there are children in this picture, she could decide to undergo an experimental treatment that could theoretically give her more time to raise her son and see him graduate, even if it means enduring pain and suffering. Knowing how the time we spend with our providers discussing our medical situations is practically zero, how can they understand what our best interests are, and make decisions based on that? Usually, we only discuss these when there\u2019s a matter of life or death. But there are so many more situations in which we need to consider them. (In case you are thinking I\u2019m placing blame on doctors, I\u2019m not. I\u2019m blaming us \u2014 the patients \u2014 and the healthcare system metrics that track efficiency and not care.)\nI believe relationships between patients and providers (and hopefully health insurance companies) are destined to change. Every now and then you hear someone asking if a medication will make him gain weight, or if a specific type of food could be the reason for his allergies. Usually, those issues are discussed among friends and families, or blogs or support groups. People are resourceful, after all. I\u2019m pretty sure word-of-mouth is still the best publicity for informal advice. Doing research with patients and caregivers, we\u2019ve learned that women whose children suffer from chronic conditions tend to group and help each other, just like pregnant women tend to talk with one another and share their experiences. You\u2019ve probably seen this everywhere, given that we are social beings. This anecdotal information could benefit patients so much, but it\u2019s not typically shared in the medical space where it could make an impact.\nMoreover, healthcare has become an industry measured by targets, KPIs, and systems and processes driven by efficiency, all designed to be economically viable. Through this process of commercialization, we have all lost sight of what\u2019s most important: our care. Doctors go from appointment to appointment trying to reach quotas (like number of patients seen per day); nurses and healthcare team members spend the bulk of their time doing paperwork that allows tracking, billing, etc.; patients don\u2019t inform doctors of everything they need to know because appointments are cut short; health insurance companies are designed to react when there\u2019s a crisis, but they\u2019re not in the business of trying to keep people healthy. This is an equation that is not sustainable.\nGoing back to Rachel Bostman, there are four major components to her trust formula. Let\u2019s see how they might look as seen through a patient\u2019s eyes:\n(Feel free to interchange the subject or pronouns of your preference: he / she / provider / doctor / healthcare team / clinic / insurance agent or company / practitioner / nurse...)\nWhile there may be some positive responses to the above questions, that won\u2019t always be the case. Here\u2019s my take:\nMost systems are broken, but people are not. So, whenever the system fails us, we should be able to at least count on people. What does this mean for me? As a patient, I try to be nice to the lady at the front desk of the hospital admissions. It all comes down to common sense: If I acknowledge the immense burden she has doing her job, chances are, she will do her best to help me. Although I wish it were different, I don\u2019t always trust that hospitals have my best interest in mind since they tend to see the money signs in \u201cbed count\u201d \u2014 but she might.\nA little piece of advice I received from a mother /caregiver while doing research: Always be nice to nurses. They can make things happen. Be on their good side. This applies to anyone who\u2019s on the service end of the healthcare system. Even when it\u2019s hard, I smile at the health insurance agent. I don\u2019t call him names, or hang up the phone, or yell (I do my best never to do that, even if a call center causes me to lose my temper). Realizing he has a difficult job, and I can make it less difficult by offering him respect and treating him like a human being. This can have wonderful results. When I show empathy, I might get it back. When I\u2019m lucky, I know I can trust that this person might go above and beyond to help me.\nThe hardest part is trying to be completely honest with my healthcare team. It took me a while to learn this: I am the one holding all the information about what\u2019s going on with my body, and I am my only fully-invested advocate. So, I try to explain everything with examples and details and I try to keep track of the issues that are bothering me. Telling your doctor that your wrist hurts is very different than explaining to her that the pain started at night and worsens when you sleep (not while you are writing an article on your computer). In the end, I try to promote these meaningful conversations so we can make decisions together.\nAnd when it comes to healthcare providers, whenever I get the chance, I try to remind them that patients don\u2019t know what they don\u2019t know. Keeping in mind the knowledge gap is not always easy, so a reminder is always useful. I\u2019m very aware of the emotional burden that providers face while dealing with metrics, quotas, and back-end tasks, and I have seen how some providers face dilemmas that might compromise their judgment or ethics. Although prioritizing their ethics might be difficult, they\u2019ll sleep better at night doing so.\nFor my part, I believe that every healthcare organization has good allies who you haven\u2019t met yet: service designers. We\u2019re in a unique position to examine broken systems and ideate new ways to improve upon them, and have already had some great success (check out Designit\u2019s project in Oslo that reduced the wait time of breast cancer diagnostics by 90%). If your healthcare organization could use a systematic change that would put communication back into the patient/practitioner equation, service designers are a valuable asset. Healthcare is changing, so try to keep up.\n", "link": "https://medium.designit.com/the-future-of-healthcare-carving-out-a-new-system-from-a-broken-one-53aeca2ad887", "author": "Designit", "comments": [], "claps": "26 claps"}, {"num_comments": 5, "title": "ClinicAll: The road so far... \u2013 ClinicAll Healthcare \u2013 Medium", "tags": ["healthcare", "ico", "success", "crypto", "roadmaps"], "reading_time": 4, "text": "Every tale has a beginning, just as any successful venture has its history. Big industrial giants have not always been that way; all of them were startups once upon a time. The natural order of things seems to be the most definitive. To reach the top, one should start from the bottom, learn the system from the inside, and gradually aim higher and higher. The same applies to the majority of companies. To thrive, the company must know its chosen industry, its needs and challenges.\nClinicAll was founded in Germany in 2008. The company saw business opportunities establishing modern infotainment systems for patients, providing more features and options in comparison to the traditional TV sets used at the time. At this point, development of the company\u2019s software and multilateral technological ground for the system under development was started. Since then, Germany has been ClinicAll\u2019s entertainment system domain. The growing demand for the company\u2019s software solutions in the form of bedside terminals pushed the company forward along with its international expansion. In 2010, ClinicAll International Corporation was founded in the USA. In the following years, the corporate organization evolved into a network of wholly-owned branches of the ClinicAll International Corporation, comprising of national subsidiaries in Germany, Austria, France, Spain, Switzerland, Gibraltar, North America and Middle East.\nOver the years, the company made numerous partners from different areas. In 2012, ClinicAll established a strategic partnership with Microsoft and launched the then-new Windows 8-based software for clinic terminals, taking a unique position in the market, pursuing its long-term vision of patient bedside software reformation. This software platform enabled easy integration of any third party software, paving the way for further global environment creation.\n2013 marked the launch of the CliniTec Box, the first fully integrated patient bedside terminal and software in a portable inward trolley. The same year, a super-rugged tablet PC to ClinicAll specifications was also introduced, designed to withstand the hard everyday use in hospital environments. Innovative use of hardware for hospitals has been a constant topic ever since. Today, ClinicAll systems can be installed at the patient\u2019s bedside, they can be accessed from Android or iOS devices via the new ClinicAll Mobile App, and also large-format high-definition TV screens can also be seemlessly integrated.\nThe year 2014 brought the ability to access Electronic Medical Records through ClinicAll terminals, with its first implementation in a hospital in Slovenia. In 2015, the company presented its ClinicAll Software App v2.0 which offered real-time multitasking for TV/Internet/phone connections supplemented with additional hospital service proposals. Thanks to HIS integration into the system, hospital staff were finally able to maintain and add patient records in digital format without leaving the ward. The system undertook administrative procedures and an automated check-in, saving time for qualified personnel. Saudi Arabia welcomed the new software by installing 200 pieces of the software in its leading private clinic group with a new individualized screen design covering 24 applications. Similar success awaited in Qatar, with more than 400 ClinicAll systems being installed in 2018.\nWhen the German Federal Health Minister paid a visit to ClinicAll\u2019s German branch in 2017 with his presentation on \u201cThe Significance of IT and Digitalization for Future Supply Structures,\u201d it coincided with the company\u2019s ambition for the creation of a global digital health community uniting patients, hospital staff and other players in the healthcare industry under one roof. In 2018, ClinicAll has made a live demonstration of its new ClinicAll Mobile App, leading to the digitized health community beng available from all over the world at the conhIT exhibition. This app means that ClinicAll services were now also available on iOS and Android devices, so that support for all major operating systems is ensured. By that time, a great variety of new features were integrated into the system.\nAs of now, ClinicAll\u2019s blockchain initiative is considered one of the most promising among other healthcare projects thanks to its unique peculiarities. With practically unlimited growth potential in terms of community expansion, the global scaling of the ecosystem is only a matter of time. The environment welcomes everyone, whether working in healthcare or using healthcare services, which makes potential users of the whole planet. Lack of geographical boundaries ensures the opportunity to obtain adequate treatment, medicines or other care services wherever users might be. Implementation of automated software solutions for administrative tasks takes the edge off the current shortage of qualified personnel who are occupied with time-consuming administrative duties.\nWith the inflow of patients comes an increased number of available services and thus the companies providing them. A comfortable and economically beneficial payment system positively influences overall services, leading to the companies\u2019 revenues rising without pinching patient budgets. The digital nature of the system speeds up the shift towards digitized medical records, eliminating the problems of insufficient data interoperability and saving up a substantial amount of time by lessening the administrative workload for medical professionals. Considering the ongoing technological revolution and mass data digitization, it\u2019s of crucial importance to ensure data security and privacy despite the overall transparency of operations. The immutable essence of data transactions prevents corruption and imposes a higher level of data security.\nWhile giving preference to a specific initiative for the healthcare \u2018upgrade,\u2019 both governments and end users need to consider the experience of the ClinicAll company team and its dedication to the chosen course. There are numerous healthcare projects to support, but in the end, it\u2019s always the one offering maximum opportunities for patients and medical institutions which will continue the race. The proactive social position of the healthcare community members can make a difference in our world of tomorrow, and if we\u2019d like to have a bright and glowing future, we should care about what we choose.\nLearn more about ClinicAll and their mission to change the healthcare industry forever on https://clinicall.io/\n", "link": "https://medium.com/@clinicallhealthcare/clinicall-the-road-so-far-97713db6cf00", "author": "ClinicAll Healthcare", "comments": [], "claps": "10.9K claps"}, {"num_comments": "unspecified", "title": "Robotic Process Automation In Healthcare \u2013 Tanmay Terkhedkar \u2013 Medium", "tags": ["healthcare", "uipath", "automation", "rpa tools", "blue prism"], "reading_time": 3, "text": "Robotic Process Automaton is important to maintain up-to date and accurate records when their medical information and history is consulted.Integration across these systems via RPA, reduces the labour work, speeds up the healthcare process and also guarantees the accuracy of information.\nRPA Blue Prism Technology in the healthcare domain used to increase the efficiency of operational efficiency,reducing labour cost,clinical support process,system integration on a large scale. Blue prism can provide quick delivery of patient records, faster insurance claims and many more. Most of the organization using this technology for their front and middle office operations.\nIn the middle office, it is associated with revenue cycle management(RCM). The RCM spectrum consists of twenty different activities. These activities are from the scheduling of a patient to reconciliation and claim submission. With the automation, the revenue cycle processing is accelerated by automating the process of claim re-submission.\nDifferent technologies like Claim posting, verification process, also RPA Blue prism are used in coding updates, insurance data management, charge capture, etc.\nThe front office is a still an on-demand area with high potential for RPA Blue Prism Applications. It integrates the care management system, increases the case management process. It has the aim to satisfy the clinicians by spending more time on patients caring. The disruption in the healthcare segment has been happening to turn the conventional treatment process into the modern one meeting the ever-changing demands of the society. This is the primary reason why it is very essential to make investments in technologies like RPA.\nPatient Management System (PMS) refers to a number of efficient automatic systems to track the segments such as diagnosis, description, assigned doctors. It helps to track patient information. Blue Prism helps to automate the PMS. We can develop in-patient and outpatient databases more effectively, also reducing the work and can save time.\nMostly UiPath is used in back-office operations of healthcare. It enables to efficiently run the on boarding process improve the accuracy and efficiency by the clinical staff that can begin their work without any delays in system access and facilities. UiPath can automate the billing and claims processes.It can automate an insurance claim processes.It also ensure that patient makes the payments or not. UiPath can automate scheduling and send appointment reminders to patients. Doctors will be maximizing the number of patients they see each day.It increase the productivity and efficiency.\nUse of RPA improves customer service and makes required healthcare information access faster. Also, the human labour at the back-end and front-end can be reduced, resulting in cost saving.The manual process of appointment and billing procedure can be done more accurately and quickly using RPA. RPA\u2019s frees up the time of doctors and healthcare providers who can then spend that time with their patients and focus on their work. Managing and processing information spread across many internal and external sources, including clinical applications, lab information systems, etc can also be done with the help of RPA.\n", "link": "https://medium.com/@tanmayct/robotic-process-automation-in-healthcare-a97628bce3f5", "author": "Tanmay Terkhedkar", "comments": [], "claps": "501 claps"}, {"num_comments": 4, "title": "The Case for Teaching History in Language Classes \u2013 Lessons from History \u2013 Medium", "tags": ["history", "linguistics", "language", "education", "teaching"], "reading_time": 8, "text": "The story of the Great Vowel Shift helps demystify English spelling for second-language learners.\nOne of my favourite anecdotes about the absurdity of English spelling, which I never fail to share with my ESL students, is frequently attributed to George Bernard Shaw, although it does not appear in any of his writings. The invented word ghoti is intended as a creative spelling of the word \u201cfish\u201d, with the gh pronounced as an \u201cF\u201d as in \u201cenough\u201d (\u026a\u02c8n\u028cf), the o pronounced as an \u201cI\u201d as in \u201cwomen\u201d (\u02c8w\u026am\u026an), and the ti pronounced as an \u201cSH\u201d as in \u201cmotion\u201d (\u02c8mo\u028a\u0283\u0259n).\nG.B. Shaw may indeed have been the originator of this clever illustration of the English language\u2019s orthographic irregularities (He was, after all, a vocal proponent of spelling reform.) but even if he wasn\u2019t, others have made creative use of the word \u201cghoti\u201d, ranging from James Joyce\u2019s inclusion of the word in Finnegans Wake (in the line \u201cGee each owe tea eye smells fish.\u201d) to linguist Marc Okrand\u2019s use of it as the constructed Klingon language\u2019s word for, yes, fish ( ghotI\u2019).\nIt\u2019s a great linguistic meme, as well as a useful intro for one of my now-favourite topics for my ESL classes, which is the Great Vowel Shift of 1350\u20131600, a historical occurrence that I have found helps students from other countries and linguistic background make sense of English\u2019s seemingly anarchic spelling rules.\nThe ubiquitousness of Latin and French loanwords in English (and more recent imported vocabulary from other languages) are such that it\u2019s easy to forget that English is technically a Germanic language whose closest continental cousin are the Frisian languages, minority languages still spoken in the Dutch province of Friesland and parts of northwestern Germany. That said, English doesn\u2019t really sound like a Germanic language, as a result of a massive influx of Romance language vocabulary as well as a curious divergence in pronunciation of much of its original Germanic content.\nThere once was a time when the English word \u201cboot\u201d was pronounced more like \u201cboat\u201d as it is in German, and the word \u201cbite\u201d was pronounced like \u201cbit\u201d \u2014 in a fashion more typical of Germanic orthography. The old English word \u201cknight\u201d, typically a head-scratcher for ESL students, once sounded much more like it looks. Monty Python fans will be amused to note that the taunting French knight played by John Cleese in Monty Python and the Holy Grail is actually being somewhat historically accurate when he calls King Arthur and his companions \u201csilly English ken-niggits\u201d. Makes me wonder if that joke was an Easter Egg planted there to amuse scholars of Middle English and old Anglo-Saxon. (Given how educated the Pythons were, I wouldn\u2019t put it past them.)\nSo what happened to this alleged Germanic language? From 1154 to 1485 the English throne was occupied by the House of Plantagenet, who hailed from the historical French province of Anjou and simultaneously ruled nearly all of modern France, Wales, Ireland, and some bits and pieces of the Holy Roman Empire.\nUnder the Plantagenet Dynasty, French became the prestige language of England, its influence gradually trickling into the Middle English spoken by the common folk of the day. Ever wonder why English, alone among languages I\u2019m familiar with, has different words for types of meat and the animals they come from? The nobles who ate the lion\u2019s share of the meat were French speakers (hence calling it boeuf, porc, mouton etc.) whereas purely Germanic words like cow, pig, and sheep were the purview of the peasants who raised said animals.\nThen there was a lovely little thing that changed the entire demographic (and ultimately linguistic) picture of the British Isles called the Black Death. In a little over a year from 1348 to 1349 the bubonic plague epidemic that had swept Eurasia wiped out anywhere between 40 and 60 percent of the country\u2019s population and reduced the population of its capital city by a full third. Many scholars have postulated that the Great Vowel Shift was triggered in large measure by the massive population readjustment that occurred in the plague\u2019s aftermath, including a massive influx of new residents into the city of London, bringing with them a complex array of local dialects and pronunciations.\nThe Black Death also paradoxically had a positive effect on class and economic mobility, which in turn no doubt had an effect on the spoken language of the time \u2014 with newly empowered former peasantry eager to emulate the French-influenced argot of the ruling classes.\nThe next phase of linguistic disruption probably began in 1485 with the death of Richard III, the last of the Plantagenet monarchs, and the rise of the tempestuous Tudors under Henry VII. The change of scene from a nominally French monarchy to a Welsh ruling family (the name Tudor comes from the old Welsh tud (territory) and rhi (king)) may have brought about a backlash against French influence on the English language, further contributing to the ongoing vowel shift. Ever wonder why the word \u201cnice\u201d and the French city of Nice have totally different vowel sounds? The change of ruling dynasties may have had something to do with it.\nThe rise of the Tudor Dynasty also more or less coincided with the proliferation of the newly invented printing press throughout Europe. (It should be noted here that while the printing press was new to Europe, woodblock printing had been in use for at least 600 years already in China, Korea and Japan.) While the movable print revolution largely solidified English spelling, the vowel shift persisted for some time thereafter, resulting in some curious inconsistencies in pronunciation. For example, the \u201cea\u201d sound in the words \u201cswear\u201d and \u201cbear\u201d retain their original Middle English pronunciation while the vowel sound in \u201chear\u201d and \u201cnear\u201d is a product of a vowel shift that persisted into the 17th century. The writings of Shakespeare are relatively straightforward reading for modern-day English speakers, but would be much tougher to grasp if performed entirely in the spoken vernacular of 16th century London.\nWhy should any of this matter to today\u2019s ESL learners who, one might think, are far too preoccupied with learning practical career and life-oriented English to think about the impact of feuding monarchs and deadly plagues on the English of yesteryear?\nHere\u2019s why I think it matters. Every language has its own unique pitfalls and idiosyncrasies, and as a teacher nothing annoys me more than when I hear fellow instructors responding to student questions about why a certain rule applies to the language (and doesn\u2019t elsewhere) with some version of \u201cBecause it just does.\u201d The answer \u201cbecause I said so\u201d doesn\u2019t cut it for four year olds asking why they can\u2019t stay up all night, and it is no more acceptable for adult learners of English. It always has been, and forever will be, a cover for ignorance.\nOf course, ESL teachers are not all trained historians and/or linguists, and can\u2019t possibly be expected to understand the root causes of every quirk and oddity about the English language, and indeed many such answers evade the leading scholars of the language to this day. However, even a cursory knowledge of the history of written and spoken English can help demystify the language to newcomers to it, and while it may not immediately resolve the issue of why the word \u201cbear\u201d rhymes with \u201chair\u201d and \u201chear\u201d rhymes with \u201cdeer\u201d, it can at least make the inconsistencies of English spelling easier to grapple with mentally.\nAs a student of the Japanese language for many years, I found that a solid grounding in Japanese cultural, political, and religious history to be not only valuable but actually essential to gaining any sort of grasp of the language. The differentiation between the Sino-Japanese on\u2019yomi (\u97f3\u8aad\u307f) and the indigenous Japanese kun\u2019yomi ( \u8a13\u8aad\u307f) readings of Chinese characters in the Japanese language requires at least a basic understanding of Japanese history, from its ancient pre-literary animist roots to its incorporation into China\u2019s cultural orbit (and its adoption of Buddhism) to the subsequent historical pendulum swings between neo-Confucianism and nativist forces intent on expunging Chinese influence.\nIn addition to its obvious cultural debt to China, the Japanese language is also replete with loan words from European languages, but even these came about at different times and in different ways, and making sense of them requires some historical knowledge. The Portuguese Jesuits first arrived in Japan in the mid-16th century, bringing with them words like tabako, pan (bread), and tempura that are still commonplace in the Japanese language. The next wave of foreign linguistic imports came about in the late 19th and early 20th centuries when Japan was in breakneck modernization mode, but at the same time imbued in nationalist zeal. Have you ever wondered why words for overseas inventions embraced by Japan during the pre-World War II era like kuruma (\u8eca) for car or yakyu\u0304 (\u91ce\u7403) for baseball are generally translated into Japanese whereas postwar imports like terebi (\u30c6\u30ec\u30d2\u3099) or intanetto (\u30a4\u30f3\u30bf\u30fc\u30cd\u30c3\u30c8) are simply lifted directly from English? From 1945 onward, English, and all things American, was hip. Before 1945, not so much.\nAnd without this rather important historical knowledge, nothing about the Japanese language would make the slightest bit of sense.\nAs native speakers of the world\u2019s most ubiquitous language, people like us have the luxury of not having to think about our own language very much. We take our language \u2014 and all its weirdness \u2014 for granted, scarcely pausing to wonder why \u201cI\u201d always comes before \u201cE\u201d except after \u201cC\u201d (with the notably exception of that Scots Gaelic loanword \u201cweird\u201d \u2014 a word popularized by a certain Scottish-themed Elizabethan tragedy) or why \u201cgoose\u201d (derived from the Old English go\u0304s, rendered as ga\u030as in the Scandinavian languages) gets the plural \u201cgeese\u201d while the word moose (a 17th century import from the Eastern Abenaki language of modern-day New England and Atlantic Canada) doesn\u2019t become \u201cmeese\u201d. But when an ESL student asks why this is the case, it pays to have an answer beyond \u201cBecause it does, OK?!\u201d None of my Japanese language instructors ever answered any of my many questions in this way, and I hope never to have to either.\nBesides, it\u2019s all just really, really interesting. And while my obsession with the shadowy history of the English language\u2019s wandering vowels perplexes some of my fellow language teachers, I\u2019ve generally found that my students find it nearly as interesting as I do. Or perhaps they\u2019re just humoring me.

They never ask my sexual orientation.\nWhat I want to tell this student is that I\u2019m not married, but have been in a committed relationship with a man for five years.\nBut I don\u2019t say that. I don\u2019t even say part of that. I just say that no, I\u2019m not married, and move on to the next part of the lesson as fast as I can.\nIt\u2019s not that it would bother me if students in any of my classes somehow found out I\u2019m gay. And if a student asked me directly about my sexual orientation, I\u2019m confident that I wouldn\u2019t lie.\nIt\u2019s just that I don\u2019t think that part of my personal life belongs in the classroom. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s relevant to the success I and the students have during the course of the semester.\nStill though, I wish I could be more honest when it comes to this side of me.\nIt\u2019s 2019. Students today are different than many of the students I went to school with in the 1990s and early 2000s. I couldn\u2019t imagine being an out gay professor in even the 1990s and being totally honest about my sexuality with my students. I would\u2019ve been terrified that I\u2019d make them uncomfortable.\nSadly, there\u2019s still a little of that terror today. I don\u2019t know the personal beliefs of my students. I don\u2019t know how they feel about the LGBTQ community. And since that part of myself doesn\u2019t really need to be in the classroom in the first place, I keep it hidden. I don\u2019t talk about it. I pretend it\u2019s just not there.\nPart of me thinks that\u2019s the smart thing to do. And another part of me thinks it\u2019s keeping my whole self from being fully present in the classroom.\nBecause I want to be even more of myself. I don\u2019t want to feel like I\u2019m hiding something that nobody should ever know. I\u2019m proud to be gay. I\u2019m proud to be a member of the LGBTQ community. There\u2019s nothing I\u2019m ashamed of.\nIt\u2019s something I still need to work on. And it\u2019s something I hope I have answers to in the years to come.\nBecause to be the best teacher you can, you need to feel confident about yourself in every way. You should feel comfortable in being honest about who you are, while also staying focused on the agenda of the day and not turning the class session into some kind of therapy session.\nBut you also need to be yourself, too, not just part of yourself. You don\u2019t want to present a version of yourself that isn\u2019t 100% authentic, that isn\u2019t true to who you are. You don\u2019t want to be afraid to share a part of yourself that stays hidden far too often than it should.\nThis is still a work-in-progress for me, but I know I\u2019ll get there one day.\nAnd I hope the same for you, too.\n\u2014\nBrian Rowe is an author, teacher, book devotee, and film fanatic.

Ten years ago, moving abroad to a tropical destination to teach English was considered adventurous and even dangerous, now it is associated with boozy twenty-somethings who have no idea what to do and figure that the backdrop of Thailand or China, would be better than the rainy reality they face every day.\nIt is a common desire now, to experience a new destination, teach English and live the lifestyle they had only dreamed of, and it\u2019s becoming more achievable and popular by the day.\nWith the necessary money, getting qualified as a (TEFL) teacher is surprisingly easy. You pay between 100 and 300 euro, download your course and complete your modules. Some more difficult than others, you have unlimited attempts to pass and when you do, you get a shiny certificate through the post box and voila, you\u2019re a qualified (TEFL) teacher!\nThen the application process begins \u2014 but what\u2019s more important is the destination. Vietnam or Korea? Spain or Mexico? The world is your oyster (unless of course, you count English speaking countries or English-equipped ones like Germany or Scandinavia). Try hard enough and you can go wherever you like.\nI\u2019ve noticed that there is a type of hierarchy which groups the people to the destination they choose.\nFirst are the serious, solemn ones, who want to make money and do it with class \u2014 these guys usually head straight for Dubai, China or Korea where they are at the top of their game.\nSecondly, is the blowouts, usually the lost people who just want some fun or an idyllic tropical experience that will help find themselves (sometimes it works, others can come back with no money and a liver more damaged than when they left) these people go to Southeast Asia, i.e. Thailand, Vietnam, and Cambodia \u2014 it\u2019s cheap, the money is good and you can party.\nThen, there are the toe-dippers, who want to try but don\u2019t want an immersive experience \u2014 something close to home but diverse enough that it\u2019s exciting, but not overwhelming. These ones stick to Europe, namely Spain, Poland or France.\nLastly are the ones that truly want to help, that want to impact other peoples lives dramatically (Not egotistical, I hope) and try to achieve it through education. These people are the best ones, the ones that started the game and usually head to more downtrodden places \u2014 like Mexico, South America or Africa.\nIf you know me, you\u2019ve already guessed that I fit the slightly anxious, unsure category and teach English in Spain.\nI pictured colourful buildings, copious amounts of fruit, leisurely time, wine on terraces, lots of money and little hours. I got about half of that, and it didn\u2019t necessarily amount to the killer combination I had dreamed of.\nI\u2019ve taught English for about seven months now, and I\u2019m not the first of my friends to get a sudden inspiration to move abroad and get away. From the other side of these itchy feet, I have learned that TEFL teaching is enormously glamourized. Between the good and the bad, there is more than just sunny landscapes and tropical weather to consider. It\u2019s important to think twice, which is exactly what the TEFL industry doesn\u2019t want you to do. Here are ten points that I know not everybody thinks about before making the big decision to head out into the world of TEFL.\nThis part of the job is easily the most glazed over yet important bit. People sit through the reams of grammar modules while doing the course, but immediately forget anything that semi-made sense until facing their first class about the present perfect tense with clammy hands.\nThe English language is tough, and I count my blessings every day that it is my native tongue and I don\u2019t have to think about when I should say \u2018I went\u2019 or \u2018I have been\u2019. There are so many rules that they cancel each other out, and this is the part that I ironically find the most testing in the job. It\u2019s meticulous and time-consuming to understand myself, let alone explain to students.\nIf you slip up and contradict yourself (a common occurrence) they will sense weakness and sometimes question you more, which usually results in a lot of \u2018hold on, let me see...\u2019 while you try to think of an answer to bluff yourself out of the hole that you\u2019re digging.\nBut worse than this, is watching the students growing frustrations with themselves (and with you) when they do not understand or remember. It\u2019s often a burden shared.\nEven if you have a natural talent for children, which I admit is a minor requirement when teaching English, keeping them interested and entertained is hard-hitting. I usually leave an hour class with kids exhausted like I used to be after a ten-hour shift, and with a pounding headache.\nAnother problem with children is that not only can they dislike learning English, they can also refuse to speak it. If you don\u2019t speak their native tongue it can be tricky, and you can end up with a screaming six-year-old chanting Spanish.\nIncreasing interest and partaking in TEFL courses and job-searching for jobs has, of course, led to an increase in scams, a predictable outcome of the greedy human race. I\u2019ve heard horror stories of schools popping up and disappearing overnight, so-called companies falsely offering to reimburse flights and provide accommodation upon arrival, alleged organizers leading budding teachers down rabbit holes and long-term employees not getting paid.\nMoney naturally leads to corruption so watch out for any signs that don\u2019t feel right and always verify before trusting. This investigative nature should begin upon enrolling in the chosen TEFL course, as a lot of the cheap ones can be lowgrade, also.\nOkay, nothing I have been subjected to, but from my personal research, and membership of different online platforms for teachers, ageism is widespread in the TEFL community. These schools desire perky, excited, young people who may take on more work than are willing and do it for less money than they deserve. They don\u2019t want older, more intelligent and less impressionable people who are more likely to stand up for themselves and know their worth.\nPerhaps this one is particularly partial to me, but from what I\u2019ve heard a lot of these jobs can involve an unprecedented amount of travel time and an unorthodox amount of preparation. I remember on my TEFL course, I learned that preparation time should take approximately twice the amount of time of the lesson itself and you should always have extra materials. And even if you do below the average amount of prep, you\u2019re still looking at a lot of bonus unpaid hours.\nIf you hit the jackpot, your employer will provide you with all necessary materials, bankroll your prep time and create a workable schedule that manages your time ideally. If you\u2019re like the majority (and me) you will spend a lot of time traveling, start from scratch and find (and pay for) your own teaching materials and have your preparation time creep into your own, unpaid, free time.\nFor some, teaching in a school might mean school-time hours with evenings free. But often, English schools are set up to work outside of school and office hours, to fit students\u2019 schedules after their normal working or schooling day, meaning a lot of evenings and weekends. If you think teaching is an escape from working late night hours in a bar (like me) it may be an improvement, but you find you're still working past 5 or 6 unlike your friends, and your evenings are not your own.\nThe money is not as amazing as is perceived, especially in the beginning. It may be an improvement from your normal hourly wage, but with limited working hours, you\u2019ll find your paycheck isn\u2019t so impressive. With unpaid preparation and travel time, that number can seem even smaller.\nIf you get a job in the big leagues, I\u2019m sure you will be salary-content, but those positions can be hard come by. Another consideration is tax, which can be higher than expected (especially in Spain!). For a lot of teaching jobs, the advertisements will promise an impressive monthly wage but often with tax considered and the impossible maximum hours, that number can be difficult to reach.\nI used to always see private teaching as a handy side gig that would get you some easy money. When it becomes your full-time position, it gets difficult, fast. No colleagues, no manager to guide and help with queries, just you, your student and your metro card. Private teaching can be a horrible limbo in-between self-employment and no employment, ultimately being neither, with just an email address to answer to and a monthly payday. My main piece of advice when it comes to private teaching is to avoid it. Leave the private teaching as a side hustle and get yourself a school to report to every day.\nFor a lot of the companies that advertise and promote teaching, you\u2019ll find that their main selling point is escaping the reality of a 9 to 5 and moving to an exotic destination to begin a new chapter. They very rarely focus on the actual act of teaching and its day to day workings. It can be boring, and if your students don\u2019t succeed, neither do you. This pressure may seem minuscule at first but as days progress it can become an unwanted pressure that manifests as a failure.\nUltimately, teaching isn\u2019t for everyone, but it is a worthy experience, nonetheless.\nIt can be an amazing opportunity to learn a new culture and perhaps even a new language. It can be a new beginning or a much-needed break, and it can be eye-opening to meet, teach, and learn from people that you wouldn\u2019t necessarily strike up a conversation with on the street.\nIt can encourage a new way of thinking, to match other minds, a time to learn about a language that is so often taken for granted.\nPlaying with kids is fun and talking with adults is interesting. The money isn\u2019t all that bad and the preparation work is an informative and virtuous experience.\nThere are cons to every job, and lots of pros too. But with a rise of social media and the need to constantly document our lives, it is easy to fall into the trap of believing in a filtered lifestyle. We only see the best in other people\u2019s jobs and experiences, and the glorification can leave people discontented and restless with a lifestyle they once loved.\nWe need to remember that everything is not as it seems and not so simple and that we should believe our research and our intuition over that one person\u2019s photo, advertisement or experience.\n", "link": "https://medium.com/@a.smithbeef/why-tefl-teaching-isnt-all-it-s-cracked-up-to-be-904fb350ab31", "author": "Aoife Smith", "comments": [], "claps": "60 claps"}, {"num_comments": 1, "title": "Potholes \u2013 Shana V. White \u2013 Medium", "tags": ["inequity", "whiteness", "teaching", "education", "institutional racism"], "reading_time": 5, "text": "Every day on my drive to work, I almost look like I\u2019m playing \u201cFrogger\u201d trying to actively avoid a large number of potholes in the streets near both of my schools. Some are deep and will damage my car, others smaller, but the cracks are visible and create a noticeable, uneven pavement that slows my driving. Some of the potholes have been on the roadways for months so I am prepared for them, while others pop up somewhat unexpectedly and I attempt to prevent damage to my car by swerving hopefully in the nick of time.\nUnfortunately, I recently realized my drive to work these potholes in the road are a perfect metaphor for education. Assisting Black and Brown students to navigate our pothole ladened educational system is an almost daily requirement for an equity-minded educator.\nOne of those potholes showed up recently for my students and me. A few weeks back, I had another hard conversation with one of my classes. This class of all Black students, most of whom are freshman, stared up at me as I sighed and started class with: \u201cwe need to talk.\u201d I proceeded to talk to them about the work they submitted and how it would not meet the expectations and standards of the College Board. I told them how heartbroken I was that they hadn\u2019t given their best effort because opportunities to engage in an AP course as a freshman doesn\u2019t happen often for Black students. I continued rather passionately reminding them that this system was not built for them and prefers that they fail early and often. I reminded them once a week as I arrive at their school, that I walk past a police van that sits outside the front door of their school with the intention of using a hall sweep encourage class attendance but instead to usher them into the prison system. I emplored them that I can\u2019t care more about their success than they do, but know historically the chances of students afforded the opportunity to experience success is few and far between from this zip code. I finished by saying \u201cpeople expect anyone from this zip code to be unsuccessful and amount to nothing. You help prove and confirm white people\u2019s deficit mindsets and racist tropes about Black students each time you don\u2019t submit your best work and make your best effort academically. I can\u2019t protect or warn you all the time, but I will remind you while in this class, we will defy the racist narratives and misconceptions that have been imposed on you. You are brilliant and more than capable. We will disrupt and subvert this unjust system. I want you to all to know I care about your success not only in this class but more so as people.\u201d\nAs I finished, I felt my eyes beginning to water. This class is normally a lively and somewhat immature group who are still navigating the craziness of teen years while learning and growing into their unique identities, but today they were engrossed and extra attentive to my words. I was emotional because I knew what they submitted was not their best. I was emotional because, after the talk, they realized and admitted they did not do their best. I was emotional because I care about each of them experiencing success. I was emotional because I know how quality, trajectory-changing opportunities are not readily offered to students at this school. I was emotional because I wanted to protect them from the development of an inferiority complex, imposter syndrome, or a bottom of the hierarchy position whiteness violently thrusts on them. I was emotional because I knew I could not prevent them from soul-draining toxicity of whiteness embedded in standardized testing systems. I was emotional because I was deep within the crosshairs of how to either prevent or prepare my students for the external assessment and judgment pothole requirement for this course.\nToeing the line between protection and preparation of young people is a hazardous, treacherous, and emotionally draining daily endeavor. Equity-minded educators know subversion, determination, and passion is each essential to providing equitable and quality learning experiences for Black and Brown kids. We know the potholes are there. We know the potholes will always be there, hell, other Black and Brown educators fell victim to many of them during our schooling years. But we have to walk a narrow balance of preventing our students from the pain of an encounter with a deep pothole while in our care as well as foresight in preparing them for the potholes we know they will encounter, but we might not necessarily experience with them. We know most of these potholes will never be patched. We know some of these potholes are deep and very damaging. We know some of these potholes are smaller with the intent to slow. We know many of these potholes have shoddy patch jobs that will lead eventually to a larger pothole forming. Mind you, we don\u2019t try to save our students nor do we expect our Black and Brown students to pull themselves up by their bootstraps to travel this treacherous, pothole-filled road. We do, however, help in small chunks, by teaching and providing students some tools to navigate around and prepare for the potholes of an unjust educational system. We who earnestly do this work, also encourage them during the process to successfully create/find their own boots and laces to survive and hopefully thrive while in K-12 classrooms and post K-12 life too.\nI realized after my conversation with my students last week I am still emotional for other reasons as well. I am emotional because of the willingness some educators to both inadvertently and purposely assist this system in crushing and crapping on the potential for many Black and Brown students to succeed. I am emotional because of the low number of educators with the capacity to treat Black and Brown kids well. I am emotional because of the low number of educators who respect and value the unique brilliance of Black and Brown kids. I am emotional because of the gross negligence some practitioners exhibit that ruins opportunities for Black and Brown students in schools. I am emotional because of the grotesque buildings with roaches, rats, mold, leaky ceilings, and non-functioning HVAC systems, we subject and expect so many Black and Brown students to learn inside of in 2019. I am emotional because I abhor what whiteness does to Black and Brown kids in our schools. I am emotional because many educators continue their steadfast commitment to upholding whiteness that dominates and destroys Black and Brown lives in our schools.\nI am emotional, fatigued, and slowly losing hope. I am feeling somewhat defeated. My spirit is grieved. My soul aches. This should not be normal. This is unfair. This is not okay. This is wrong. This is unjust. The potholes continue to multiply in both number and size however our capacity to best prepare and prevent them from hurting kids is decreasing because we are tired.\nI am extremely emotional and exhausted with every damn right to be.

The United Nations says that we\u2019ve got about twelve years left to avert that catastrophe.\nTwelve years.\nThat is not a lot of time. Remember when Steve Jobs announced the iPhone? That seems like yesterday. It occurred in 2007 \u2014 twelve years ago. Remember when J.K. Rowling announced the last Harry Potter Novel? That seems like yesterday. It was in 2007 \u2014 twelve years ago.\nSo what should we do given that we have twelve years and that twelve years is not a lot of time?\nWe could turn to technology and hope that we can find and implement some sort of \u201cfix.\u201d That sounds terrific but what is the likelihood that a real solution can be found and implemented in twelve years?\nThat is a rhetorical question. The chances are very slim.\nWe could turn to government and ask it to find a solution. That, too, sounds terrific but can we think of many instances where government has been responsive to public concerns and has done something that does not directly benefit large corporations, who constitute the true government?\nThat, too, is a rhetorical question. The chances are very slim.\nAs I watch the Extinction Rebellion folks glue themselves to various objects and demand that the government create and cede authority to a \u201cCitizens\u2019 Assembly\u201d that will decide how to avert climate catastrophe, I wonder \u2014 seriously \u2014 if these people live on the same planet as I do. Does anyone really believe that there is a snowball\u2019s chance in hell of that happening?\nIs there anything that we could do that would make a difference?\nYes, there is one thing that we could do that does not require technological innovation or governmental action.\nThat one thing: we can transition to a vegan diet.\nWe have known for years now that animal agriculture is horribly unsound in terms of inefficient resource use. Animals have to consume many pounds of grain or forage to produce one pound of meat. Animal agriculture involves an inefficient use of water; it takes many times more water to produce a pound of meat than to produce a pound of potatoes or wheat.\nRecent and very impressive work by Oxford researchers has made clear that a vegan diet is the single most significant thing we can do to avert climate catastrophe. One of those involved in that work, Dr. Joseph Poore, stated: \u201cA vegan diet is probably the single biggest way to reduce your impact on planet Earth, not just greenhouse gases, but global acidification, eutrophication, land use and water use.\u201d He added that going vegan \u201cis far bigger than cutting down on your flights or buying an electric car.\u201d\nAnother Oxford research team found that massive reductions of meat consumption was necessary to avert climate catastrophe. We are not talking about \u201cMeatless Monday\u201d or \u201cvegan before 6.\u201d We are talking about everyone eating 75% less beef, 90% less pork and half the number of eggs. And dairy also has significant adverse environmental impacts.\nA recent study by Harvard University showed that UK would be able to sustain itself and combat climate change by returning land used for animal agriculture back to forest: \u201c[c]onverting land currently used for grazing and growing animal feed crops back to forest could soak up 12 years\u2019 carbon emissions.\u201d\nWe need a serious campaign to bring a simple message to the world: We\u2019ve got twelve years left. \u201cIf you want to avert climate catastrophe, you really need to cut out the meat, dairy, eggs, etc. and go vegan. Eat fruits, vegetables, grain, seeds, etc. \u2014 foods that are widely available and cheaper than animal products. It\u2019s not an option; it\u2019s a necessity.\u201d\nAt this point, you might say that a transition to a vegan diet is not strictly \u201cnecessary\u201d because we could couple a reducetarian approach with other technologies.\nYes, we might couple significant reduction of consumption with other technologies but, again, we simply don\u2019t have the time to develop those technologies and even if all of the technologies were available now, we do not have the time to work out what combinations of strategies will work, and what numbers of people are required to participate in what strategies to achieve what could be achieved if there were a widespread shift to a vegan diet.\nPlease remember: we have twelve years.\nYou might also say that we don\u2019t have to switch to a vegan diet because a severe reduction short of veganism would work. But even if a severe reduction in consumption were sufficient, we know that not everyone will participate in that severe reduction. Therefore, those of us who completely eliminate animal products are helping to deal with the deficit caused by the non-participation of others in that severe reduction.\nPlease remember: we have twelve years.\nSo whether a widespread transition to a vegan diet is necessary in the strict sense of \u201cnecessity,\u201d it is necessary as a practical matter. It may not be sufficient in that we may have to do more. But we certainly need to do at least that.\nAt this point, having run out of ways to avoid the unavoidable, you may ask the question: as a practical matter, how can we achieve this? You might be thinking that a widespread transition to a vegan diet is simply unrealistic.\nThe answer: We had better hope it\u2019s not because we\u2019ve got twelve years left and it\u2019s the only thing that we can do that will have a significant impact, does not involve technological innovation, and does not require governmental action. It\u2019s something we can choose to do.\nWhat needs to happen is for the environmental movement to accept the necessity of this widespread transition to veganism. At the present time, no segment of the environmental movement is proposing veganism as necessary. The Green Party does not propose it; Greenpeace does not propose it; Extinction Rebellion does not propose it. No one proposes it. If anything, these groups go out of their way to say that a vegan diet isn\u2019t necessary.\nI understand that all of these groups are concerned that if they propose a vegan diet as necessary to avert climate catastrophe, that will adversely affect their donations.\nIt may very well do that, at least in the short term. But remember: we\u2019ve got twelve years. This is the time for these organizations to educate and to lead \u2014 and to stop being pandering to fantasies in return for donations. This is the time for these organizations to stop acting like the medieval Church and selling eco-indulgences to people who eat \u201csustainable\u201d or \u201clocally produced\u201d animal products and practice \u201cMeatless Monday.\u201d\nAnd before I forget, lest you think that \u201csustainable\u201d or \u201clocally produced\u201d animal products are the answer, think again. \u201cSustainable\u201d grazing animals may consume less grain but they drink more water because they are more active; they still produce methane gas; and they require more grazing land. Locally produced animal products have a much greater environmental impact than plants that have been grown somewhere else. According to a study in Environmental Science and Technology, transportation accounts for only 11% of the carbon footprint of food with 83% attributable to production. So the idea that you\u2019re doing more for the environment by eating animal products produced locally than vegetables transported in is just wrong.\nSo you really can\u2019t avoid the elephant in the pantry.\nIf the major environmental groups \u2014 including their allied groups all over the world \u2014 spoke with one clear voice: we have no choice but to promote a plant diet if we want to avert catastrophe, that message would attract attention from the public. It would also attract attention from governments, which have thus far been able to point to the lack of consensus amongst various factions of the environmental movement as to what needs to be done to justify doing next to nothing.\nWould many people resist this message? Of course they would \u2014 at the outset. But that is not a reason not to be clear about what needs to be done; it is a reason to work even harder to educate with a clear and single voice: we\u2019ve got twelve years left and we need to transition to a vegan diet if we want to survive.\nI recognize that this would require that leaders of the environmental movement embrace a vegan diet. Unfortunately, many leading environmentalist have actually consumed the Kool-Aid that they sell to the public in return for the donations that keep the Kool-Aid stands open. It\u2019s time that these leaders looked at the science and recognized that, as a practical matter, we need to propose a vegan diet as the norm. They need to embrace a vegan diet as necessary; they need to keep reminding themselves: we\u2019ve got twelve years left.\nBefore I end, I want to address any charge that I have another agenda here. I became a vegan 37 years ago and stay a vegan primarily for moral reasons \u2014 I I am opposed to violence. My mind boggles when I think that we kill approximately 70 billion land animals and an estimated one trillion sea animals every year for food \u2014 more than the total number of humans who have ever existed \u2014 when there is no need to do so. No one maintains that we need to eat animal products for optimal health and an increasing number of mainstream health professors acknowledge that a vegan diet may actually be more healthy than a diet that includes animal foods. Frankly, if you believe that it is wrong to inflict unnecessary suffering or death on other sentient beings, then I don\u2019t understand why you aren\u2019t vegan.\nSo if you want to dismiss what I say about veganism as necessary to avert climate catastrophe because I also believe that it is necessary as a matter of nonviolence and morality, you can do that. But I would remind you:\nWe\u2019ve got twelve years left.\n", "link": "https://medium.com/@gary.francione/twelve-years-7b9480883714", "author": "Gary L.

Ford is the leader of the Ontario Progressive Conservative Party. However, there is nothing progressive about him or his party. He is not for the \u201clittle guy\u201d as he pretends to be.\nOntarians elected Doug Ford as the Premier of Ontario in the 2018 Ontario General Election. The Progressive Conservative Party won 76 of the 124 seats at Queen\u2019s Park. On June 29 (2018), Doug Ford was sworn in as Premier and began a full-blown assault on the poor and vulnerable.\nAlmost as soon as taking office, Ford cut $100 million from healthcare. What about the plan to end hallway medicine?\nIt was followed by a $335 million cut to mental health funding. Approximately ten percent of Ontarians suffer from a mental health problem. That is higher than any other health problem.\nThe cuts to autism therapy were cruel. Ford sentenced autistic kids to a life of hardship and financial difficulty. There is life-altering therapy available but costs upwards of $100,000 per year. The new funding model caps five and under with $20,000 per year. Where is the average Ontario family going to find an extra $80,000 per year?\nFord made it harder for children to get free prescription medicines.\nIn the 2019 Budget, they cut $200 million from public health units. What function does the public health unit serve?\nThere is an opioid crisis in Ontario. Ford froze funding and closed overdose prevention sites. These closures will lead to higher HIV rates amongst drug users injecting themselves from shared needles.\nRape is a vicious crime. Very few victims even report rape. The Liberals increased Rape Crisis Centres funding by $4 million in 2019. Ford cancelled the increase. Rape victims are not reporting the crime and less likely to receive help from a Rape Crisis Centre.\nFord defunded the Commission on Violence Against Women.\nDoug Ford thinks everyone should follow what he decrees. The influential Teachers Union is going to give him a big surprise. Ford attacked teachers before he was even Premier.\nThe Ontario government is entering negotiations with the Teachers Union. Instead of entering the talks in good faith, Ford threatened the teachers not to strike before the two sides sat down to discuss a new agreement. He is cutting 3,400 teaching jobs over four years without consulting the union.\nFord wants to change the contract end date from August 31st to another time. He thinks a different date gives the government more power over the teachers in the next negotiation. No matter what date the contract ends, the teachers have the advantage. If they walk out before the school year or during gives them bargaining power.\nA small group of social conservatives insisted the sexual education curriculum convert back to the 1998 version. There was nothing on sexting, consent, LGBTQ, gender identity, and trans rights in the 1998 curriculum. Any teacher who refuses to use the 1998 curriculum can be snitched on with the new \u201cSex-Ed Snitch Line.\u201d God forbid teenagers learn about getting consent from a prospective sexual partner.\nOntario schools need over $1 billion of repairs and renovations. The Liberals allocated $100 million for 2019. Ford cancelled all repairs to schools. Leaking roof? Get a bucket.\nIn Toronto, gang violence is a serious matter. One way to prevent teenagers from joining gangs was after-school programs. Not any more! They cut $25 million from after-school programs.\nKeeping with their trend of cutting extracurricular activities; Parent Council activities funding disappeared.\nDoug Ford does not like things he cannot understand like math, science, english, climate change, and financial hardship.\nIn the 2019 budget, universities and colleges were told they needed to make performance targets. If they do not meet them, they lose up to 60% of their funding. Ford is trying to decimate Ontario post-secondary education. I cannot figure out why Ford wants to do that.\nHe does not get the nuances between the two. Ford thinks universities are breeding grounds for Marxists. The correct term is neo-Marxists, but words are not Ford\u2019s strong suit. His new \u201cfree speech\u201d laws for universities allow hatemongers such as Faith Goldy to spew her hateful rhetoric with government protection.\nOSAP provides students with grants and loans to attend post-secondary institutions. Ford eliminated free tuition for needy students. Instead, he cut tuition by 10% for all students which helps the rich kids. Most poor kids will no longer be able to continue with their education. They are stuck with their student loans and an unfinished degree at a time when Canada needs an educated workforce.\nThe most expensive part of post-secondary education is living away from home. The Liberals had a strategy of building more universities and colleges for cities that did not have them. Ford cancelled all the new universities and colleges.\nIt was not only English speaking post-secondary projects cancelled. They cancelled the new French-language university. Both the construction and administration funding disappeared to start the new institution.\nThe previous Liberal government increased the minimum wage to $14/hr at the beginning of 2018. Another increase was scheduled for January 2019 to raise it to $15/hr. Ford cancelled the $1/hr increase but kept the corporate tax cut businesses received to help compensate.\nOn top of freezing the minimum wage, Ford cut paid sick days and ten days of emergency leave for all workers. Also, Ford eliminated equal pay for equal work rules. Funding for the Workers\u2019 Compensation Fund was reduced even though it was already underfunded.\nDoug Ford campaigned that no one would lose their job under his \u201cFor the People\u201d government.\nLiar!\nThe day before the election. Doug Ford \u201cassured\u201d Ontarians he would not fire any public sector worker. He broke the promise days after taking over the province.\nAre teachers, nurses, mental health care workers, child and youth advocates not public sector workers?\nWhat about the 758 renewable energy projects Ford cancelled? They employed thousands of workers with good middle-class jobs.\nCancelling those projects was an ideological move to placate his supporters in their war on science and the environment. Climate change is real regardless of what Ford\u2019s high school dropout brain can comprehend.\nOntario had a cap-and-trade agreement with Quebec and California which fulfilled our federal requirement for a carbon tax. Ford cancelled it leaving Ontario companies with hundreds of millions of dollars worth of useless carbon credits (which we are getting sued for).\nWhat was Ford\u2019s carbon tax plan? It gave polluting corporations about $400 million in subsidies and made it free to pollute.\nFord ended the Liberal government\u2019s program to reduce hydro bills by energy conservation and renewable products.\nEnvironmental protections eliminated from the Environment Commissioner\u2019s office. Water standards rolled back to pre-Walkerton standards. People died in Walkerton because of contaminated water.\nThe Liberals were implementing free daycare for all preschoolers. Ford cancelled the program and replaced it with a tax credit. The credit is useless to low-income families who do not have the money to pay for daycare and wait for the money back on their taxes the next year. He loosened requirements to operate a daycare putting child safety at risk.\nEven more heartless than cutting free daycare, Ford scrapped the oversight of children in the foster care system. Children removed from their home because of neglect enter the foster care system with no one overseeing their care.\nOntario started a Basic Income Pilot program in three different areas of the province; Hamilton-Brant, Thunder Bay, and Lindsay. It had 6,000 participants. Individuals received up to $17,000 and couples up to $24,000 per year. People with disabilities received an extra $6,000.\nPreliminary results showed the program worked. People were healthier, happier, and cost the government less money than those on traditional social welfare programs. Why? Because people had less stress and were eating better quality foods reducing their use of the healthcare system.\nDuring the campaign, a Progressive Conservative spokesperson Melissa Lantsman was asked about whether the Ford government would cancel the pilot program. She replied, \u201cNope, as mentioned we look forward to seeing the results.\u201d\nGolem worked three jobs before the Basic Income Pilot program. The program allowed her to work full-time with a non-profit. Ford attacks the vulnerable and those trying to make a real difference in this world.\nIn the 2019 Ontario Budget, Ford slipped in a new law where no one can sue the government.\nFord used the Notwithstanding Clause to violate citizens charter rights. Why? So, he could shrink the size of the Toronto City Council. The Charter had never been used before in Ontario. The lawyers who created the Charter denounced Ford\u2019s use of it. He went against the \u201cspirit of the law\u201d to get revenge against Toronto City Council where he was a failed one-term councillor.\nFord posed for photos with Faith Goldy on several occasions and refused to denounce her hate speech and Islamophobia. Facebook de-platformed Goldy but Ford thinks she is a free speech advocate.\nThe Alt-Right controversial professor Jordan Peterson co-hosted an event with Doug Ford. Peterson claimed belief in gender identity was \u201cas bad as claiming that the world is flat.\u201d Doug neither confirmed nor denied the earth is flat. He must check with his science experts first before making any comments about a flat earth.\nOn April 15 (2019), the Ford Government in open court argued that a carbon tax rebate was unfair because minorities make less money than \u201cnon-minorities.\u201d So, their carbon tax rebate is a higher percentage of income than a \u201cnon-minority.\u201d Ford\u2019s Government admitted in open court that minorities make less money than white people. Yet, they eliminated equal pay for equal work from labour laws.\nOn April 16 (2019), the Ford Government stripped immigrants and refugees of legal counsel. Most immigrants and refugees are minorities.\nThe government spent $106,000 on \u201cOpen for Business\u201d signs. Ironically, right down the street from the Windsor \u201cOpen for Business\u201d sign. Fiat Chrysler Automobiles\u2019 Windsor Assembly Plant laid off 1500 people effective September 30 (2019). That was money well spent!\nFord wasted $137 million by interfering with Hydro One during a takeover bid for an American company. Doug Ford was named as the reason they lost the bid. It is extremely rare that an individual politician gets named and could not find another example.\nThe Ford government found $10 million for horse racing subsidies but nothing for rape victims? How is that \u201cFor the People?\u201d Is it not \u201cFor the Horses?\u201d\nDuring the election campaign, Ford was caught on tape telling major housing developers that he would open the Greenbelt to developers. Over the next three days, those developers gave $460,000 to Ontario Proud for attack ads against the Liberals and NDP. The corruption here was \u201cthird party\u201d organizations can only spend $101,800 during the election campaign. Ford might not be able to figure out the math on this corruption. However, Democracy Watch and Elections Ontario can!\nFord tried to get family friend Rob Taverner as OPP Commissioner. Taverner used to drive Rob Ford\u2019s car home when he was pulled over for impaired driving.\nFormer OPP Deputy Commissioner Brad Blair sued Doug Ford for being fired. Blair claims he never violated the Police Services Act on multiple occasions as Ford alleged. What Blair did do was release the plans for Doug Ford\u2019s tricked out minivan. A complete waste of money.\nThe OPP anti-racketeering squad is investigating Doug Ford\u2019s office for alleged illegal lobbying. The Ontario Integrity Commissioner is considering opening an ethics investigation.\nDoug Ford\u2019s leadership campaign is debt free, but he continues to fundraise for it. If the leadership campaign has no liabilities, the money transfers to the Progressive Conservative Party. Donors can double up their donations. They can donate to both his leadership campaign and the Progressive Conservative Party. This loophole allows donors to give $1,600 to Ford\u2019s leadership campaign and $1,600 to the Progressive Conservative Party. This violates the $1,600 cap on donations. It is not illegal but highly unethical and no Premier has ever done it before Ford.\nThe Doug Ford government is for the healthy, wealthy, and white citizens.\nHow can a government claim to be \u201cFor the People\u201d when there is no recourse against it through the court system?\nWhom does the government work for? Citizens or corporations?\nTo my friends and family who voted for Doug Ford: Do you think Doug Ford\u2019s policies are acceptable?\nPlease tell me that I am wrong about you.\nThank you for reading this article.

But as a very smart friend of mine once said, \u201cchoosing how you do good in this world, is a very personal decision.\u201d From tackling race and gender discrimination, to human trafficking, to education, to basic human rights, the choice of HOW to do good varies person to person.\nI spent my early career optimizing for stability. My immigrant parents encouraged me to go to law school and business school, hoping that I would have a steady income and become insulated from the possibility of economic chaos. I fulfilled their wishes, but as I moved through the world of investment banking, and saw the destruction left by the 2008 financial crisis, I realized there was no certainty in life. The stability I craved, did not exist and I pushed myself to find a new path.\nAfter working as a VC for a rock band and running my own start-up, I entered the world of blockchain. What I loved about this nascent industry is that it sought to create solutions for global problems affecting all people regardless of location and socioeconomic status. It gave hope that perhaps for the first time in history, the answers to humanity\u2019s most significant problems were not with our governments but instead with our communities and with the private sector.\nOne such global cause that has come up frequently in my search to do good was climate change. To me, however, climate change seemed too big of an issue to comprehend. Too cataclysmic. And perhaps not urgent enough. Like most people, I use plastic bottles too often, enjoy an occasional steak, and don\u2019t keep track of my carbon emissions as I zig-zag around the world. Even more honestly, I never thought about this issue because I assumed someone else would solve it.\nThe climate change narrative continued to come into my life.\nAs the frenzy of blockchain continued and large Bitcoin mining outfits expanded, the need for clean energy became obvious. In fact, Bitcoin mining consumes a whopping 1% of the world\u2019s electricity, or more than the State of New York, or 159 individual countries. And one Bitcoin transaction can use enough electricity to power 1.5 American homes for a day.\nHearing about natural disasters became more frequent. The Woolsey Fire destroyed 400 homes in Malibu, a 15-minute drive from my home in Los Angeles. Just last month, a \u2018bomb cyclone,\u2019 caused a flood in the midwestern states of Iowa, Missouri, Nebraska, and South Dakota creating an agricultural loss of over $1 billion.\nThe impact of climate change is not slowing down. According to a U.N. climate report released earlier this year, the world has only about 12 years to roll back carbon emissions and avoid the worst impacts of climate change \u2014 which will negatively affect our air quality, our water supply, and our GDP.\nAs the crisis moved closer and closer to home, I started looking at projects in infrastructure, smart cities, and renewable energy, where I could apply my skill set while still making a difference.\nI first met Ibrahim AlHusseini a little over a year ago. I was immediately impressed by his track record as an early investor in Tesla, Uber, Aspiration, and Bloom Energy. He seemingly took the profits from a business he started in college and developed the midas touch as an investor. What was even more captivating, however, was his desire for his work to benefit everyone around him.\nIbrahim was starting his third FullCycle fund at the time, which traditionally invested in waste-to-energy and other clean energy assets. The dream for this fund, however, was much bigger. He believed that if we deployed enough capital into certain assets (think waste, water, food, and electricity), we could solve for the harmful effects of climate change.\nFullCycle was the first climate thesis I saw based on infrastructure and sounded familiar. The majority of \u201cold wealth\u201d in North America was created in the late 1800s through old world infrastructure such as railroads, oil, steel, electricity, and cars by Cornelius Vanderbilt, John D. Rockefeller, Andrew Carnegie, Thomas Edison, J.P. Morgan, and Henry Ford. The track record of these businessmen is impressive, but what is even more notable, is that the infrastructure they created is still used more than 120 years later.\nAs the global population increased, so did our use of that infrastructure, causing ALMOST irreversible damage to the planet. Today, shifting to a low-carbon economy represents a similar multi-trillion dollar infrastructure opportunity. The combined markets for renewable energy ($297 billion), energy storage ($2.5 billion), green buildings ($388 billion), climate-smart urban transport ($288 billion), water recycling ($23 billion) and municipal waste management ($160 billion) are worth more than $1.1 trillion.\nFullCycle is an investment firm that is reversing the effects of climate. We do this by investing in the next generation of infrastructure designed to deliver a low carbon future. We act as both an equity investment vehicle, taking substantial ownership stakes in our portfolio companies, AND as a project finance vehicle. Simply put, FullCycle is making it more profitable for investors to restore climate change than to cause it.\nAn example of our work is our Waste-to-Energy portfolio company Synova. Synova converts any type dry waste, including plastic (yes even those pesky plastic straws!) into energy or fuel. We help Synova scale from 10 projects to 100 to 1000. Each project comes with a 20-year power purchase agreement, making sure our returns are protected. At full deployment, this company will abate one gigaton of carbon annually from the atmosphere, or the equivalent of 400,000 Olympic sized swimming pools.\nOur secret sauce is finding and scaling companies like Synova across other verticals including water, food, and energy storage. We don\u2019t invest in early-stage companies, as the current state of the planet does not leave us enough time for experimentation.\nClimate change doesn\u2019t affect everyone equally. Extreme weather events, such as fires and floods cause deterioration to infrastructure and stressed ecosystems, magnified by the growing wealth divide. Those with lower incomes have a lower capacity to prepare for extreme weather events and fewer resources to rebuild.\nFullCycle\u2019s introduction of new investment tools will help democratize wealth creation and mobilize the world\u2019s largest stakeholder community to restore our climate. These new instruments will utilize some of the latest financial technologies available, including but not limited to the distributed ledger. Why? Because we believe that restoring our climate represents the greatest investment opportunity of our lifetime, and we want to share this opportunity with others.\nYes, we are in the business of creating wealth for our investors. But more importantly, we are in the business of making the world wealthier (and healthier), as a whole.\nI invite you to join me on a journey, not of idealism, but radical pragmatism.\nFollow the FullCycle journey here.\n", "link": "https://medium.com/@tatianakoffman/why-i-joined-fullcycle-2c641a76496e", "author": "Tatiana Koffman", "comments": [], "claps": "301 claps"}, {"num_comments": "unspecified", "title": "The Home of the Future Could Be Powered by Microbes", "tags": [], "reading_time": 7, "text": "In a secure laboratory in the southwest of England, a living wall stands before me, luminous and throbbing.

Kaggle days San Francisco just concluded and as is customary, Kaggle also organised a hackathon for the participants. I had been following Kaggle days on Twitter and the following tweet from Erin LeDell (Chief Machine Learning Scientist at H2O.ai) caught my eye.\nI have been experimenting with H2O for quite some time and found it really seamless and intuitive for solving ML problems. Seeing it perform so well on Leaderboard, I thought it was time that I wrote an article on the same to make it easy for others to make a transition into the world of H2O.\nH2O.ai is based in Mountain View, California and offers a suite of Machine Learning platforms. H2O\u2019s core strength is its high-performing ML components, which are tightly integrated. H2O.ai is a Visionary in the Gartner Magic Quadrant for Data Science Platforms in its report released in Jan\u20192019.\nLet\u2019s take a brief look at the offerings of H2O.ai:\nH2O is an open source, distributed in-memory machine learning platform with linear scalability. H2O supports the most widely used statistical & machine learning algorithms and also has an AutoML functionality. H2O\u2019s core code is written in Java and its REST API allows access to all the capabilities of H2O from an external program or script. The platform includes interfaces for R, Python, Scala, Java, JSON and CoffeeScript/JavaScript, along with a built-in web interface, Flow,\nSparkling Water allows users to combine the fast, scalable machine learning algorithms of H2O with the capabilities of Spark. Sparkling Water is ideal for H2O users who need to manage large clusters for their data processing needs and want to transfer data from Spark to H2O (or vice versa).\nH2O4GPU is an open source, GPU-accelerated machine learning package with APIs in Python and R that allows anyone to take advantage of GPUs to build advanced machine learning models.\nH2O Driverless AI is H2O.ai\u2019s flagship product for automatic machine learning. It fully automates some of the most challenging and productive tasks in applied data science such as feature engineering, model tuning, model ensembling and model deployment. With Driverless AI, data scientists of all proficiency levels can train and deploy modelling pipelines with just a few clicks from the GUI. Driverless AI is a commercially licensed product with a 21-day free trial version.\nThe latest version called H2O-3 is the third incarnation of H2O. H2O uses familiar interfaces like R, Python, Scala, Java, JSON and the Flow notebook/web interface, and works seamlessly with big data technologies like Hadoop and Spark. H2O can easily and quickly derive insights from the data through faster and better predictive modelling.\nH2O makes it possible to import data from multiple sources and has a fast, Scalable & Distributed Compute Engine Written in Java. Here is a high-level overview of the platform.\nH2O supports a lot of commonly used algorithms of Machine Learning.\nH2O offers an R package that can be installed from CRAN and a python package that can be installed from PyPI. In this article, I shall be working with only the Python implementation. Also, you may want to look at the documentation for complete details.\nNote: When installing H2O from pip in OS X El Capitan, users must include the --user flag. For example -\nFor R installation please refer to the official documentation here.\nEvery new python session begins by initializing a connection between the python client and the H2O cluster. A cluster is a group of H2O nodes that work together; when a job is submitted to a cluster, all the nodes in the cluster work on a portion of the job.\nTo check if everything is in place, open your Jupyter Notebooks and type in the following:\nThis is a local H2O cluster. On executing the cell, some information will be printed on the screen in a tabular format displaying amongst other things, the number of nodes, total memory, Python version etc. In case you need to report a bug, make sure you include all this information. Also, the h2o.init() makes sure that no prior instance of H2O is running.\nBy default, H2O instance uses all the cores and about 25% of the system\u2019s memory. However, in case you wish to allocate it a fixed chunk of memory, you can specify it in the init function. Let\u2019s say we want to give the H2O instance 4GB of memory and it should only use 2 cores.#Allocate resourcesh2o.init(nthreads=2,max_mem_size=4)\nNow our H2O instance is using only 2 cores and around 4GB of memory. However, we will go with the default method.\nAfter the installation is successful, it\u2019s time to get our hands dirty by working on a real-world dataset. We will be working on a Regression problem using the famous wine dataset. The task here is to predict the quality of white wine on a scale of 0\u201310 given a set of features as inputs.\nThe data belongs to the white variants of the Portuguese \u201cVinho Verde\u201d wine.\nImporting data from a local CSV file. The command is very similar to pandas.read_csv and the data is stored in memory as a H2OFrame.\nLet us explore the dataset to get some insights.\nAll the features here are numbers and there aren\u2019t any categorical variables. Now let us also look at the correlation of the individual features.\nWe shall build a regression model to predict the Quality of the wine. There are a lot of algorithms available in the H2O module both for Classification as well as Regression problems.\nSince we have only one dataset, let\u2019s split it into training and Testing part, so that we can evaluate the model\u2019s performance. We shall use the split_frame() function.\nWe shall build a Generalized Linear Model (GLM) with default settings. Generalized Linear Models (GLM) estimate regression models for outcomes following exponential distributions. In addition to the Gaussian (i.e. normal) distribution, these include Poisson, binomial, and gamma distributions. You can read more about GLM in the documentation.\nNow, let\u2019s check the model\u2019s performance on the test dataset\nUsing the GLM model to make predictions in the test dataset.\nSimilarly, you could use other supervised algorithms like Distributed Random Forest, Gradient Boosting Machines, and even Deep Learning.you could also tune in the hyperparameters.\nAutomated machine learning (AutoML) is the process of automating the end-to-end process of applying machine learning to real-world problems. AutoML makes machine learning available in a true sense, even to people with no major expertise in this field. H2O\u2019s AutoML tends to automate the training and the tuning part of the models.\nIn this section, we shall be using the AutoML capabilities of H2O to work on the same regression problem of predicting wine quality.\nHere AutoML will run for 10 base models for 100 seconds. The default runtime is 1 Hour.\nNow let us look at the automl leaderboard.\nThe leaderboard displays the top 10 models built by AutoML with their parameters. The best model is placed on the top is a Stacked Ensemble.\nThe leader model is stored as aml.leader\nLet us look at the contribution of the individual models for this meta-learner.\nXRT( Extremely Randomized Trees) has the maximum contribution followed by Distributed Random Forests.\nThe code above is the quickest way to get started, however, to learn more about H2O AutoML it is worth taking a look at the in-depth AutoML tutorial (available in R and Python).\nIn the final leg of this article, let us have a quick overview of H2O\u2019s open source Web UI called Flow. FLow is a web-based interactive computational environment where you can combine code execution, text, mathematics, plots and rich media into a single document, much like Jupyter Notebooks.\nOnce H2O is up and running all you need to do is point your browser to http://localhost:54321 and you\u2019ll see our very nice user interface called Flow.\nHere is a quick glance over the flow interface. You can read more about using and working with it here.\nFlow is designed to help data scientists rapidly and easily create models, import files, split data frames and do all the things that would normally require quite a bit of typing in other environments.\nLet\u2019s work through our same wine example but this time with Flow. The following video explains the model building and prediction using flow and it is kind of self-explanatory.\nH2O is a powerful tool and given its capabilities, it can really transform the Data Science process for good. The capabilities and advantages of AI should be made available to everybody and not a select few. This is the real essence of Democratisation and Democratising Data Science should is essential for resolving Real problems threatening our planet.\n", "link": "https://towardsdatascience.com/democratising-machine-learning-with-h2o-7f2f79e10e3f", "author": "Parul Pandey", "comments": [], "claps": "395 claps"}, {"num_comments": 28, "title": "The Efficiency Delusion \u2013 OneZero", "tags": ["efficiency", "technology", "artificial intelligence", "digital life", "engineering"], "reading_time": 8, "text": "Co-authored with Clive Thompson\nThis year began with the writer David Pogue identifying six important lessons that he\u2019s learned from observing how tech companies behave. One of them is this: \u201cFrictionless always wins.\u201d\n\u201cIf you want to place bets on the success of new technologies, examine how much \u2018friction\u2019 they eliminate: effort, steps and hassle,\u201d Pogue wrote in Scientific American. \u201cThe remote control; microwave meals; e-mail; text messages; the iPod; Google Maps; Amazon.com; Siri and Alexa; and, yeah, self-driving cars \u2014 each, in its way, introduced a new way to let us be lazier.\u201d\nThe drive to remove friction in the digital technology space permeates everything from social interactions to business transactions, from Facebook bombarding us with notifications about what our friends are saying and doing to millions of people around the world ordering Uber rides on their phones instead of standing on street corners to hail cabs.\nIt\u2019s not hard to see why removing friction works as a business model. Reducing transaction costs has regularly proven to be a powerful way to influence behavior. And it\u2019s also not hard to see why we, the users, go for it: It\u2019s often genuinely useful when someone automates a difficult or boring task for us.\nBut efficiency isn\u2019t always value neutral. Placing efficiency over other values can be a mistake \u2014 a lapse in ethical, political, personal, or professional judgment. Some human or civic interactions thrive when they\u2019re deliberate and erode when they\u2019re sped up. There\u2019s a great quote that\u2019s been attributed to Virginia Woolf \u2014 \u201cEfficiency cuts the grass of the mind to its roots\u201d \u2014 though, alas, we can\u2019t find any evidence that it was Woolf who actually said this. But the sentiment rings true and the expression is so beautiful that we wish she did put things this way.\nBoth of us wrote books that discuss why the efficiency mindset is seductive and what can go wrong when it goes too far. Evan, a philosophy professor, did a deep dive with Brett Frischmann in Re-Engineering Humanity. Clive, a longtime writer for Wired and the New York Times Magazine, gets to the bottom of things in his new book, Coders: The Making of a New Tribe and the Remaking of the World. The following edited excerpt between us captures the flavor of a recent conversation.\nEvan Selinger: While you were writing Coders, you talked about your research to my students \u2014 many of whom are engineering and science majors. What really resonated is that some of the engineers you interviewed described experiencing inefficient situations as really troubling, like smelling something awful or tasting something gross. Can you elaborate on this visceral sense of how engineers tick, reflect their sensibilities into products, and project an impatient worldview onto the rest of us?\nClive Thompson: If you\u2019d asked me what are some of the typical traits of the people who tend to find coding fun before I started working on the book, I would have made rather obvious observations. Programmers are good at thinking logically. They enjoy solving puzzles and breaking down complicated things.\nWhat I didn\u2019t expect to routinely hear from people who became programmers is that, early on, they appreciated that machines are really good at things that humans are bad at. They\u2019re amazing at taking any process that\u2019s a boring slog and making it faster and more efficient through automation.\nDifferent coders often told me the same story from school, a moment when the efficiency lightbulb went off. As kids, they\u2019d be in math class, hating to have to show all their work. It was always some boring question they knew the answer to at a glance but were forced to write up in multiple steps. So, they all were like, \u201cLet me just write a solver,\u201d in whatever language they were using. They\u2019d type in the equation and, boom, a machine outputs all the different steps without them having to do all of the work.\nAfter this success, a realization set in: \u201cWow, my life is filled with dull, repetitive tasks. And I now know how to instruct a machine to do boring chores. So, I should hand them over.\u201d A kind of thrill in optimizing is born.\nSince computers are functional machines that can do lots of different things, these coders would very quickly start developing a type of X-ray vision about the world itself. They\u2019d just keep on thinking, \u201cWow, I could automate that. I could make this more efficient. I could automate this other thing, too.\u201d\nCan you think of any examples from the classroom that fit this pattern?\nSelinger: Yes. In philosophy classes, we ask students to present respectful and rational criticisms of other people\u2019s ideas. Don\u2019t just say someone is wrong; instead, give the best interpretation of an argument that you disagree with and carefully explain where it goes astray. This approach to speaking and thinking takes time. It\u2019s much slower than verbally kneecapping someone and stating a contrary opinion. But the lack of efficiency is a feature of the system, not a bug.\nI\u2019ve noticed some students initially find this type of interaction strange, and I\u2019ve been told that things work differently in engineering classes \u2014 at least some of them, anyway. Apparently, some instructors get straight to the point when criticizing their assignments. Being downright brutal in this context is viewed as a sign of respect, not rudeness. It\u2019s seen as a way of recognizing a student\u2019s ability to learn quickly and quickly fix mistakes \u2014 mistakes that, say, could have terrible real-world consequences, like accidents happening on a structurally unsound bridge. Coming from this background, what philosophers call \u201cdiscourse ethics\u201d can seem like unnecessary flattery that wastes precious time.\nIn your experience, what\u2019s a good example that illustrates how hard it is for programmers to stop thinking about the world as an efficiency problem?\nThompson: I\u2019ve got two for you. The first is about a fairly senior engineer who was probably a project manager. At some point, he got very angry at the number of jokes that were being told in meetings, because he was like, \u201cWell, this is a waste of time, and our time is precious.\u201d He literally calculated what he estimated to be the number of jokes told over one year and worked out how many personal hours he felt were being wasted on this.\nOf course, the surreal thing about that is anyone who actually knows how organizations work will tell you that little bits of joking in a meeting might be the most important thing being done there. They provide unit cohesion. They\u2019re moments of levity that allow people to continue working under frustrating deadlines and stuff like that. But this guy just couldn\u2019t get past seeing life as a spreadsheet.\nA woman who works for Trulia once told me, \u201cI\u2019ll be walking to work, and I\u2019ll literally be standing there at the corner watching people cross the street and think, \u2018Oh my god, they\u2019re doing this in a completely inefficient fashion. I wish I could get everyone to walk in a more optimized way.\u2019\u201d And she\u2019s sort of laughing, because she knows it sounds crazy. But she also realizes that the instinct is hard to turn off.\nSelinger: I love this story, because the second chapter of Re-Engineering Humanity is titled \u201cCogs in the Machine of Our Own Lives.\u201d It presents a series of thought experiments to help readers critically consider an important question: What behavior shouldn\u2019t you outsource to machines?\nFor example, if a GPS-like technology could safely direct your body in the direction that you wanted to walk, would you use it so you could free up your mind? Instead of paying attention to your surroundings, you could watch a video streaming online. If so, why wouldn\u2019t you go further? What about a machine that could move your mouth and chew your food for you? Or one that could adjust your face so you never missed a chance to smile at the right occasion?\nUltimately, these examples point in the direction of a frightening future that some people are really excited about. If you think the transhumanist vision of someday ditching your body altogether and downloading your consciousness is a bad idea, what arguments against it are you willing to make, and what values do you, no pun intended, stand for?\nSelinger: Why do you think so many of us keep making the same mistake over and over again? We believe that if technology can make some aspect of our lives more efficient, we\u2019ll get back free time to do the things we actually find meaningful. Instead, we often have to recalibrate what we do. And that\u2019s because expectations change along with shifts in the technological landscape.\nTake the myth that once self-driving cars spare people from the burden of needing to drive to work and pay attention to the road, they\u2019ll be able to focus their attention on invigorating and rewarding activities, like reading for pleasure during the commute. More likely, employers will expect the workday to begin the second you enter the vehicle. Instead of being disburdened, more productivity will be ratcheted out of us.\nThompson: The majority of software developers still espouse the idea that when they make something more efficient, it will have the positive effect of freeing up more time somewhere else. And I can understand why they see things that way. Coders keep their noses down when solving an onerous problem. When they\u2019re done, they feel good. And when they see people using the software they created, it feels enormously satisfying.\nPart of the issue is that American culture has long been entranced by the idea that speed is good and that getting more is good. It goes back to guys like Benjamin Franklin who were obsessed with trying to pack more into life. He invented bifocals because he was sick of swapping one pair of glasses for another. So, in many respects, we\u2019re particularly susceptible to the vision of efficiency as a way of life because it\u2019s woven into the spirit that governs the country.\nWhy are consumers so eager to find a new app that we hope will speed up our lives or give us more free time? I think this has to do with the novelty effect. When we change something in our environment, we sometimes discover that we\u2019re temporarily more productive and creative. Unfortunately, once something is no longer novel and the change in tempo or style stops feeling fresh, the effect fades.\nSelinger: That\u2019s a great diagnosis. While our Virginia Woolf quote is probably spurious, I hope others embrace the actual language I\u2019m going to use to characterize this problem. This fetish with frictionlessness should be seen as the efficiency delusion.\n", "link": "https://onezero.medium.com/the-efficiency-delusion-f6a97241e1e1", "author": "Evan Selinger", "comments": [], "claps": "2.5K claps"}, {"num_comments": "unspecified", "title": "Industry 4.0 \u2014 is there a revolution coming? \u2013 Good Audience", "tags": ["technology", "artificial intelligence", "blockchain", "ai", "cloud computing"], "reading_time": 6, "text": "Industry 4.0 is a new approach to enabling a genuinely productive future with technological advancements. It is termed as the fourth industrial revolution because of the fourth historic move in history. The first industrial revolution in the 19th century moved humanity from farming to factory production. The second revolution that lasted up to World War I observed the use of steel, mass production, and electrification of factories. The third revolution is characterized by a paradigm shift from analog devices to digital technology that gained prominence from 1950 to 1970. Industry 4.0 is the next big thing that can indeed be considered a revolutionary approach. It is an aggressive use of digital data in the interconnected, smart spaces and devices. According to the estimates by KPMG, the component markets of Industry 4.0 will increase substantially in the next few years, and it will be approximately $4 trillion by 2020. It has even surpassed the business volume of the Internet of Things, which, according to the estimation of Gartner, will be worth $3.7 trillion by 2020.\nThe presentation of the concept of Industry 4.0 is attributed to a German government memo. The memo was released in 2013 mentioning the term \u2018Industrie 4.0\u2019 for the first time. It was a strategic document regarding technology infrastructure, and it aimed for full automation of the processes of manufacturing industry such that there is minimal or no human intervention. The concept gained further prominence when Angela Merkel, German Chancellor, discussed the idea of Industry 4.0 in the World Economic Forum in January 2015. The challenge described the approach as the one that will integrate the online world with the world of industrial production. The German government has taken the lead in implementing this approach, and it has invested \u20ac200 million for promoting research and development in this area. The United States has also responded well to the notion of Industry 4.0, and it has established the Smart Manufacturing Leadership Coalition (SMLC). SMLC is a coalition of technology firms, manufacturers, suppliers, government, and academic institutions to implement Industry 4.0 concepts and get the benefits in the short and long run.\nIndustry 4.0 will make intelligent use of the Internet of Things (IoT) and the sensors\u2019 data to extract business intelligence essential for producers and manufacturers. The emphasis in this approach is on higher productivity and cost reductions through the use of real-time data and connected environment. A significant challenge in the current context is the management of a huge set of data that is often termed as \u2018big data\u2019. Industry 4.0 will deploy robust data analytics systems using the techniques of artificial intelligence (AI), data mining, and big data science. As a result, the systems will be able to produce insights from big data that will be a valuable source of information for senior management. Another critical aspect of Industry 4.0 is a secure communications infrastructure. The infrastructure will ensure real-time connectivity and availability of data. However, at the same time, it will assure that data remains confidential and is not accessed by unintended recipients.\nA significant outcome of implementing Industry 4.0 approach is the emergence of smart factories. These factories will harness information and communication technology for optimizing their supply chains and production lines. All business processes will share the aspects of automation and digitization. Machines will be equipped with the capabilities of self-learning that will be manifested in the form of self-configuration, self-optimization, and self-correction. The techniques of artificial intelligence will enable offering better quality products with superior cost efficiencies. The introduction and implementation of Industry 4.0 concepts will also enhance the employment opportunities, and a report by the UK government predicts that it will create 175,000 new jobs and provide benefits to the manufacturing sector to the extent of \u00a3445 billion.\nThe world is now witnessing a global trade war where the countries are imposing tariffs on imported products to encourage local investors and reduce the pressures on their economies. The U.S. China trade war is a notable example that was also followed by tensed trade relations between Canada and China. The new realities have necessitated looking for alternatives in the supply chain. It is because there may be concerns over technological espionage and trade imbalances.Consequently, when there is a ban on particular hardware and manufactured technologies from a specific country, the contingency plan should be ready to keep the business operations smooth and stable. In the Industry 4.0 approach, manufacturers will need to assess the impact of the trade wars on their global supply chains. They should reassess the security controls of their industrial systems and scrutinize their imports for potential exploits, whether they are intentional or unintentional.\nIn the context of developed countries, it is challenging to prepare the manufacturing sector for the Industry 4.0 approach. It is such a disruptive and thriving technological approach that it will provide a significant competitive advantage to the countries that will be early takers. In a study, different countries and regions were studied regarding their strategic readiness and implementing enabling technologies for Industry 4.0. The findings revealed the highest preparation of China (92%), followed by Europe (65%), and the United States (44%). It can result in a further increase in the soft power of China and increase the tensions in the trade relationships of China with other countries.\nIndustry 4.0 enabling technologies will provide new employment opportunities across the globe. However, the manufacturing sector will also experience workforce-related issues. Workers will be required to demonstrate highly advanced and sophisticated skills to accomplish tasks in an Industry 4.0 environment. Hence, the human resources department of the organizations will face this challenge of not only to retain the existing workforce but also to hire a new generation of tech-savvy workers.\nBlockchain technology has the potential of integrating the global supply chains because it works with a decentralized ledger and all the transactions are authenticated through a consensus in the blockchain. The supply chain management solution at the enterprise-level supported with blockchain will ensure enhanced security and scrutiny of the processes and provide an enabling environment for the businesses. The blockchain infrastructure has demonstrated limitations regarding scalability and speed. However, it is expected that a few successful implementations will address the shortcomings and enable its widespread adoption. Manufacturers will be able to track the products from the factory floor to cargo ships, manufacturing facilities, and beyond.\nIndustry 4.0 technologies will be driven by real-time availability of data, smart devices, and cloud computing platforms. For example, there will be machines autonomously identifying whenever they need spare parts. There will be production systems that will execute their quality control operations. Robots will be used to recognize and move components. All these technologies make efficient use of the concepts of artificial intelligence and edge computing.One of the examples of such technologies is Siemen\u2019s Digital Enterprise Portfolio. The portfolio is used in every step in the industrial production including product design, product manufacturing, and the use of the product. A virtual form of the product is also created known as a digital twin. Other promising platforms include MindSphere and cloud-based operating system offered by Siemens for the Internet of Things. Organizations are also exploring drone-delivery of the products and using energy-efficient products. Siemen\u2019s Amberg Plant uses the algorithms of artificial intelligence for using data from milling machines and updating about the end of service lives of the machines\u2019 spindles. Edge computing supports full implementation with short transfer paths and real-time data processing.\nThe future growth of Industry 4.0 enabling technologies will rely on combining digital and industrial expertise. It will require a commitment and collaboration from the companies of all sizes in all industries, but the revolution seems to knock at our doors.\n", "link": "https://blog.goodaudience.com/industry-4-0-is-there-a-revolution-coming-71d6c6a8259d", "author": "Piotr Jurowiec", "comments": [], "claps": "1.2K claps"}, {"num_comments": 41, "title": "TensorFlow is dead, long live TensorFlow! \u2013 Hacker Noon", "tags": ["technology", "tensorflow", "artificial intelligence", "hackernoon top story", "machine learning"], "reading_time": 8, "text": "If you\u2019re an AI enthusiast and you didn\u2019t see the big news this month, you might have just snoozed through an off-the-charts earthquake. Everything is about to change!\nLast year I wrote 9 Things You Need To Know About TensorFlow... but there\u2019s one thing you need to know above all others: TensorFlow 2.0 is here!\nIt\u2019s a radical makeover. The consequences of what just happened are going to have major ripple effects on every industry, just you wait. If you\u2019re a TF beginner in mid-2019, you\u2019re extra lucky because you picked the best possible time to enter AI (though you might want to start from scratch if your old tutorials have the word \u201csession\u201d in them).\nIn a nutshell: TensorFlow has just gone full Keras. Those of you who know those words just fell out of your chairs. Boom!\nI doubt that many people have accused TensorFlow 1.x of being easy to love. It\u2019s the industrial lathe of AI... and about as user-friendly. At best, you might feel grateful for being able to accomplish your AI mission at mind-boggling scale.\nYou\u2019d also attract some raised eyebrows if you claimed that TensorFlow 1.x was easy to get the hang of. Its steep learning curve made it mostly inaccessible to the casual user, but mastering it meant you could talk about it the way you\u2019d brag about that toe you lost while climbing Everest. Was it fun? No, c\u2019mon, really: was it fun?\nTensorFlow\u2019s core strength is performance. It was built for taking models from research to production at massive scale and it delivers, but TF 1.x made you sweat for it. Persevere and you\u2019d be able to join the ranks of ML practitioners who use it for incredible things, like finding new planets and pioneering medicine.\nWhat a pity that such a powerful tool was in the hands of so few... until now.\nNow that we\u2019ve covered cactuses, let\u2019s talk about something you\u2019d actually want to hug. Overheard at my place of work: \u201cI think I have an actual crush on Keras.\u201d\nKeras is a specification for building models layer-by-layer that works with multiple machine learning frameworks (so it\u2019s not a TF thing), but you might know it as a high level API accessed from within TensorFlow as tf.keras.\nKeras was built from the ground up to be Pythonic and always put people first \u2014 it was designed to be inviting, flexible, and simple to learn.\nWhy must we choose between Keras\u2019s cuddliness and traditional TensorFlow\u2019s mighty performance? Why don\u2019t we have both?\nGreat idea! Let\u2019s have both! That\u2019s TensorFlow 2.0 in a nutshell.\nGoing forward, Keras will be the high level API for TensorFlow and it\u2019s extended so that you can use all the advanced features of TensorFlow directly from tf.keras.\nIn the new version, everything you\u2019ve hated most about TensorFlow 1.x gets the guillotine. Having to perform a dark ritual just to add two numbers together? Dead. TensorFlow Sessions? Dead. A million ways to do the exact same thing? Dead. Rewriting code if you switch hardware or scale? Dead. Reams of boilerplate to write? Dead. Horrible unactionable error messages? Dead. Steep learning curve? Dead.\nYou\u2019re expecting the obvious catch, aren\u2019t you? Worse performance? Guess again! We\u2019re not giving up performance.\nTensorFlow is now cuddly and this is a game-changer, because it means that one of the most potent tools of our time just dropped the bulk of its barriers to entry. Tech enthusiasts from all walks of life are finally empowered to join in because the new version opens access beyond researchers and other highly-motivated folks with an impressive pain threshold.\nEveryone is welcome. Want to play? Then come play!\nIn TensorFlow 2.0, eager execution is now the default. You can take advantage of graphs even in eager context, which makes your debugging and prototyping easy, while the TensorFlow runtime takes care of performance and scaling under the hood.\nWrangling graphs in TensorFlow 1.x (declarative programming) was disorienting for many, but it\u2019s all just a bad dream now with eager execution (imperative programming). If you skipped learning it before, so much the better. TF 2.0 is a fresh start for everyone.\nMany APIs got consolidated across TensorFlow under Keras, so now it\u2019s easier to know what you should use when. For example, now you only need to work with one set of optimizers and one set of metrics. How many sets of layers? You guessed it! One! Keras-style, naturally.\nIn fact, the whole ecosystem of tools got a spring cleaning, from data processing pipelines to easy model exporting to TensorBoard integration with Keras, which is now a... one-liner!\nThere are also great tools that let you switch and optimize distribution strategies for amazing scaling efficiency without losing any of the convenience of Keras.\nIf the catch isn\u2019t performance, what is it? There has to be a catch, right?\nActually, the catch was your suffering up to now. TensorFlow demanded quite a lot of patience from its users while a friendly version was brewing. This wasn\u2019t a matter of sadism. Making tools for deep learning is new territory, and we\u2019re all charting it as we go along. Wrong turns were inevitable, but we learned a lot along the way.\nThe TensorFlow community put in a lot of elbow grease to make the initial magic happen, and then more effort again to polish the best gems while scraping out less fortunate designs. The plan was never to force you to use a rough draft forever, but perhaps you habituated so well to the discomfort that you didn\u2019t realize it was temporary. Thank you for your patience!\nThe reward is everything you appreciate about TensorFlow 1.x made friendly under a consistent API with tons of duplicate functionality removed so it\u2019s cleaner to use. Even the errors are cleaned up to be concise, simple to understand, and actionable. Mighty performance stays!\nHaters (who\u2019re gonna hate) might say that much of v2.0 could be cobbled together in v1.x if you searched hard enough, so what\u2019s all the fuss about? Well, not everyone wants to spend our days digging around in clutter for buried treasure. The makeover and clean-up are worth a standing ovation. But that\u2019s not the biggest big deal.\nThe point not to miss is this: TensorFlow just announced an uncompromising focus on usability.\nAI lets you automate tasks you can\u2019t come up with instructions for. It lets you automate the ineffable. Democratization means that AI at scale will no longer be the province of a tiny tech elite.\nImagine a future where \u201cI know how to make things with Python\u201d and \u201cI know how to make things with AI\u201d are equally commonplace statements... Exactly! I\u2019m almost tempted to use that buzzword \u201cdisruptive\u201d here.\nWe know it\u2019s hard work to upgrade to a new version, especially when the changes are so dramatic. If you\u2019re about to embark on migrating your codebase to 2.0, you\u2019re not alone \u2014 we\u2019ll be doing the same here at Google with one of the largest codebases in the world. As we go along, we\u2019ll be sharing migration guides to help you out.\nIf you rely on specific functionality, you won\u2019t be left in the lurch \u2014 except for contrib, all TF 1.x functions will live on in the compat.v1 compatibility module. We\u2019re also giving you a script which automatically updates your code so it runs on TensorFlow 2.0. Learn more in the video below.\nTF 2.0 is a beginner\u2019s paradise, so it will be a downer for those who\u2019ve been looking forward to watching newbies suffer the way you once suffered. If you were hoping to use TensorFlow for hazing new recruits, you might need to search for some other way to inflict existential horror.\nSitting out might have been the smartest move, because now\u2019s the best time to arrive on the scene. As of March 2019, TensorFlow 2.0 is available in alpha (that\u2019s a preview, you hipster you), so learning it now gets you ready in time for the full release that the community is gearing up for over the next quarter.\nFollowing the dramatic changes, you won\u2019t be as much of a beginner as you imagined. The playing field got leveled, the game got easier, and there\u2019s a seat saved just for you. Welcome! I\u2019m glad you\u2019re finally here and I hope you\u2019re as excited about this new world of possibilities as I am.\nCheck out the shiny redesigned tensorflow.org for tutorials, examples, documentation, and tools to get you started... or dive straight in with:\nYou\u2019ll find detailed instructions here.\n", "link": "https://hackernoon.com/tensorflow-is-dead-long-live-tensorflow-49d3e975cf04", "author": "Cassie Kozyrkov", "comments": ["Thank you for cleaning up TF!

Well, it\u2019s the reality and ExMarkets users will be given the opportunity to become a part of it.\nYANU Initial Exchange Offering goes live on Friday, April 26th 2 PM EET and will run for 1 month with an immediate exchange listing on ExMarkets.\n\u201cDue to our community requests to buy Yanu tokens, we decided to do an IEO round just before listing the token on first exchanges. This is a good opportunity for investors, who just hear about the project or who missed out on the ICO to get involved\u201d \u2014 says Alan Adojaan the CEO of Yanu.\nOne thing to know about YANU \u2014 they have already reached their soft cap through the tokensale and succeeded to raise over $1,000,000 USD. Moreover, YANU has an active and very fun-oriented community of more than 50,000 token-holders.\nHere at ExMarkets, we\u2019re already preparing for the increased traffic once we list YANU tokens, it may get hectic. That\u2019s why we strongly suggest getting there early and acquiring some YANU while the IEO is ongoing.\nExMarkets IEO LaunchPad is a cryptocurrency platform enabling the most promising blockchain and crypto projects to get a head start. Check it out now.\nMore about YANU project\nFrom the top level, YANU is an A.I. powered robot bartending unit. It mixes cocktails, serves drinks, handles payments, and maintains interaction with clients.\nBehind the scenes of a cool and futuristic design, the bartending unit is an amalgam of engineering solutions and long hours of excruciating programming that resulted in an autonomous machine created to work together with people and their entertainment.\nIt can store as much as 50 bottles at the same time, serve up to 100 drinks per hour and can maintain a conversation with the client through the interactive app and touchscreen tablets while broadcasting all the information to the cloud allowing the bar owner to monitor performance, bottle reserves and more.\nThere might be no end to cool features and applications of the robot, but sometimes a video might be way more telling than words. Click here to view the video explainer about the YANU.\nAnother rather refreshing thing about the project is their transparency, they openly admit that YANU has no actual use for blockchain yet despite token issuance being their chosen method for fundraising and community building. And from the looks of it \u2014 they succeed at what they set out to do.\n\u201cAfter seeing YANU on the Barcelona Tokenmatch event, I instantly knew this is a gem in the nightlife scene. I imagine the booth serving drinks on the beach during a heat wave. This project has many opportunities and I can\u2019t wait to see it live in action. After talking with the team it became clear to me that they know what they are doing and are not impulsive. Considering all the options and work out a nice strategy. This isn\u2019t a money grab, Yanu will change the game!\u201d \u2014 Chris Waton, Chief Business Development Officer at ExMarkets and CoinStruction Liquidity Framework.\nThe company managing the project is called Robolab and was founded back in 2016 by a group of entrepreneurs who wasted no time and instantly brought seasoned scientists and engineers to build and commercialize cost-effective service robots for the hospitality and entertainment industries.\nTokensale fundamentals info\nTo serve as an icing on the cake the team is also going to implement YANU candy box which will reward the community for holding the tokens until the end of the year.\nJust to reiterate: the IEO launches on April 26th and will last for 1 month to be followed by listing on ExMarkets Cryptocurrency Exchange.\nIt is better to get in early and keep YANUs safe until the end of the year to be eligible for the candy box rewards. Go ahead and visit ExMarkets LaunchPad to get accustomed to the environment. Do not forget to register an account in advance!\nMore about the candy box initiative will be disclosed in the nearby future.

I could never do that.\u201d\nWhile this response may help people feel better about themselves, it certainly won\u2019t make them smarter.\nBecause the reality is: Buffett has spent most of his time reading and thinking since he was in grade school. Having more money or managing a large company doesn\u2019t magically give you free time.\nHaving free time is never the default. People don\u2019t just fall into huge blocks of free time unless they retire. Rather, free time is the result of strategy. It\u2019s the result of looking at time differently.\nCurious about Buffett\u2019s unique strategies, I\u2019ve read several books about him, read most of his annual letters to stockholders, and watched nearly all of his interviews.\nAnd make no mistake about it... behind Buffett\u2019s jovial demeanor is the most stone-cold, ruthless prioritizer (in a good way) in the world.\nBelow are the top six strategies Warren Buffett has used throughout his career in order to have lots of reading and thinking time. I invite you to copy them so you can have more time to do what\u2019s most important to you everyday.\nAs you read these strategies, be aware that these aren\u2019t just random strategies that are thrown together like the typical listicle you see online. There\u2019s a deeper pattern that most people miss \u2014 his #1 mental model.\nBuffett has eliminated almost all of the obligatory CEO tasks from his schedule:\nWhat\u2019s important to see here is that these decisions don\u2019t happen by accident. They require continually resisting immense social pressure.\nWe get insight into how Buffett deals with distractions and obligations via his personal pilot, Michael Flint. Buffett once walked Flint through his three-step strategy for prioritization [1], and I invite you to try it right now in order to truly get the message:\nBuffett\u2019s strategy gets at a few fundamental truths:\nSimilar to how Buffett audits his work activities, he also audits who he works with.\nBuffett ONLY works with CEOs he trusts, who get results, and who he can see himself working with for decades. As a result, he does incredibly little negotiation and due diligence before he buys a company, and doesn\u2019t actively manage the CEOs of the business he owns. Furthermore, he enjoys the conversations he has with the CEOs.\n(Notice the word \u201ctrust.\u201d Buffett has passed up on purchasing many companies with attractive financials who had CEOs he did not trust.)\nBuffett applies the same criteria to the people on his team \u2014 many of them have been with him for decades.\nBuffett has cut out nearly all of the bureaucracy in his company. Berkshire Hathaway\u2019s portfolio companies have nearly 400,000 employees, but its actual headquarters has only two dozen employees or so. Here is a photo from the 2014 Christmas Party of one of the largest companies in the world:\nBuffett\u2019s personal life is also very simple. He lives in a modest home (the same one he has been in for 60 years), and he only spends $100,000 per year personally.\nAs we grow in our careers, in our companies, and in our lives, it\u2019s extremely easy to add complexity. In fact, it\u2019s the norm.\nAs you get more profit, it\u2019s normal to hire more employees. As you earn more money, it\u2019s normal to spend more and more.\nWhat\u2019s truly powerful and unique is to keep things simple. That takes effort and skill. And, that is part of Buffett\u2019s genius.\nIt\u2019s odd to say this, but one of the world\u2019s richest people may also be one of its biggest minimalists when you compare the lifestyle he could live to the one he chooses to live.\nWarren Buffett only makes a handful of investments per year.\nI remember when I first heard this, I was shocked. \u201cHow can the wealthiest investor in human history do so few deals?\u201d\nWilliam Thorndike gives us the answer to this question in his book, The Outsiders:\nBuffett explains his philosophy in the following clip from the Becoming Warren Buffett documentary:\nIn short, Buffett says:\nBuffett holds his bets for extraordinarily long periods.\nAccording to investor William Thorndike, author of The Outsiders...\n(I wrote more about how Buffett focuses on a few big bets in this article.)\nBuffett applies a similar concept to investing in knowledge that will pay him back forever. In the only authorized biography of Buffett, his biographer comments on what she learned from him:\n(I wrote more about how knowledge compounds in Why Successful People Spend 10 Hours A Week On \u201cCompound Time\u201d)\nBuffett is not alone in thinking long-term.\nSam Altman, the president of Y Combinator, the largest accelerator in the world, refers to long-term thinking as \u201cone of the few arbitrage opportunities left in the market.\u201d Jeff Bezos measures the success of new programs over seven-year time frames, while most other public companies think in three-month increments. (I go deeper into Bezos\u2019 long-term thinking philosophy in this article.)\nOne would think that the greatest investor of all time (the GOAT if you will) stays on top of the latest technologies in order to stay up-to-date.\nInterestingly, the opposite is true. Here are few examples:\nThese unique choices show a few things about Buffett:\nNow, you understand. Warren Buffett\u2019s free time to read and think isn\u2019t just a fluke. He\u2019s designed his life for it.\nAnd these aren\u2019t random strategies... They are all derived from a critical mental model \u2014 the 80/20 Rule \u2014 the fact that 20% of efforts cause 80% of the results across many areas of our life. In each domain of his life \u2014 relationships, investments, technologies, priorities \u2014 Buffett is a master at ruthlessly prioritizing the few things that matter and cutting out everything else.\nSo, now the question is: how do you actually consistently and masterfully apply the 80/20 Rule to your life.\nWhile Buffett\u2019s 3-step process is extremely helpful on a theoretical level, I\u2019ve also found it lacking on a practical level. It misses a lot of the nuance that can derail the plans of us mere mortals.\nFor example, simple putting something on an \u201cavoid-at-all-cost\u201d list is not enough. It takes work and skill to avoid these tasks in my experience. In addition, prioritization takes time, which means you need to make it a new habit, and creating consistent habits take hard work and skill.\nSo, here is the adapted 13-step process I use so you can prioritize your schedule with the 80/20 Rule:\nEach of these steps is absolutely critical. Miss one of them and your ability to pick and follow through on the right priorities plummets.\n* * *\nWe all have 24 hours in a day. Therefore, \u201chustling\u201d harder can only get us so far.\nFocus is one of the 20% of skills that give us 80% of results in our life. It allows us to accomplish in one year what might take someone else a decade. Furthermore, by focusing on the few things that matter at work, we get back time in our personal life to be healthy and spend time with loved ones.\nBut remember this: To get the full benefits of focus, we need to look at it as difficult skill that takes years of practice to develop. Focusing sounds simple, but it requires huge emotional and cognitive resources to follow through on consistently. This is why everyone touts the power of focus, but few people actually truly focus.\nWarren Buffett\u2019s strategies inspire us all to be one of the few who do.\n***\n[1] Disclaimer: Keep in mind that I came upon the story of Buffett\u2019s pilot through a chain of people I trust, and it has been written about in several top publications.

Kiyosaki, in Rich Dad Poor Dad, explains how continuous learning is key to getting rich.\nIs the secret to becoming rich about thinking and learning then?\nFor the most part \u2014 yes. But how?\nIn \u201cthinking\u201d, you foster self-reflection, curiosity, and imagination \u2014 skills long forgotten by adult age for most people.\nIn a piece called \u201cLearn and Grow Rich\u201d, I bet you\u2019re expecting me to mention how going to school has something to do with growing rich, but that\u2019s not at all what learning means. Think about this: \u201cLearning\u201d and \u201cAcquiring Knowledge\u201d are not the same.\nWhen you foster self-reflection, curiosity, and imagination, you force yourself to learn. You learn about yourself, your peers, and the world surrounding you. You question popular dogma and seek your own answers, creating connections in your brain. This is learning. Whereas simply storing information in your hippocampus is knowledge.\nWhy is learning better?\nUnapplied knowledge is just wasted \u201cspace\u201d in your brain. What good is acquiring a vast library of information if it\u2019s never put to use?\nThis two-word concept has two surprisingly deep ideas:\nYou think being rich happens overnight?\nHeck no!\nThe true rich grow rich, meaning, they have built their wealth and richness through a variety of skills they had to learn the hard way \u2014 like you and I. The difference with the majority is that the rich have deliberately decided to continuously learn throughout their lives.\nI\u2019m not saying an overnight success doesn\u2019t exist, it\u2019s just extremely rare.\nThe first thing people think about when they hear the word \u201crich\u201d is a pile of cash or luxury items. Both are wrong. Kiyosaki got it right in Rich Dad Poor Dad when he says that the rich have assets, not liabilities.\nBut here\u2019s another thing the rich have in common: a large and diverse set of skills.\nA recession hits? For the \u201ctrue\u201d rich, that\u2019s not a problem. They use their skillset to adapt and figure out the next good way to pick themselves back up.\nAnother definition of rich also means \u201cabundant\u201d or \u201cplentiful\u201d, which applies to anything even outside of money. You can be rich in love, happiness, and why not, health as well!\nWhatever definition of the word \u201crich\u201d you use, learning new skills can help you achieve it.\nIn \u201cLearn New Skills in 15 Hours: The Essential Guide\u201d, I mention seven reasons for learning new skills. See image above for the list.\nWhen you\u2019re having fun, you have more energy and increase your motivation. When you\u2019re motivated, you learn more, and the more you learn, the faster you learn. Then, the more you learn, the more interesting you become, helping you expand your network and help people in meaningful ways. When that happens, you start to thrive.\nWhen an obstacle comes your way, you\u2019re equipped to move past it, because you know how to do other things, or think creatively about new solutions. And if you don\u2019t, you have a network of people who are there to help you.\nBy constantly learning new skills, you always start from failure. You start from a point where you have no experience. This is a most powerful habit as life inevitably will throw you off your butt. Instead of panicking, you\u2019ll simply skill up and adapt to your new situation.\nThe rich are not one-off wonders. Someone who wins the lottery is not rich, they\u2019re lucky. As such, most people who become \u201crich\u201d overnight tend to not keep that wealth for long.\nHere\u2019s one of my own personal favourite sayings:\nFor as long as I can remember, I haven\u2019t cared for money. It felt like it was for superficial people only caring about themselves. I was wrong. In the last few years, I\u2019ve been studying the rich by reading a lot of biographies.\nHere\u2019s what I\u2019ve come to realize:\nIf you want to be rich, learn what the rich have learned. They don\u2019t think like the majority. The majority are poor. As much as you can, surround yourself with people you consider rich in any pillar of life. Ask them questions on how they got there. Ask them which skills they use on a regular basis.\nGetting rich is rarely unintentional in action. It\u2019s through self-improvement that one becomes exceptional, sometimes leading to richness. As such, grow rich for personal growth, not for the end result \u2014 money.\nIn Rich Dad Poor Dad, Kiyosaki names the following seven skills as being prime skills to help you become wealthy:\n...any other skill you can combine to the above.\nLike many skills, these are all skills you\u2019ll learn during the course of your lifetime. The good news, however, is that you can learn the basics of each of them in less than 20 hours of deliberate practice. That won\u2019t turn you into an overnight multi-millionaire, but it sure will make you richer.\nIf you follow my essential guide to learning any skills in 15 hours, you should have no problem learning most these within about two months, even while working at a full-time job.\nThe best introduction to the subject I know is the book I\u2019ve mentioned a few times already: Rich Dad Poor Dad. It\u2019s the easiest book to digest on the topic and can be read in as little as 3 hours.\nNote: The skills below are skills I\u2019m currently working on learning. As such, I am not yet rich in wealth, but I\u2019m planning to change that by increasing my abilities in the seven skills.\nReady?\nLet\u2019s explore each skill in greater detail:\nDefinition: \u201cthe action or process of keeping financial accounts.\u201d\nHow do I learn this skill?\nLike many of the seven skills, there\u2019s a lot of jargon in accounting. Get familiar with it. Practice by doing financial statements for your own finances. Go to your personal accountant and ask them to explain the concepts to you. Take notes. Read books and play the Cashflow game.\nDefinition: \u201cto commit (money) in order to earn a financial return.\u201d\nHow do I learn this skill?\nGet familiar with the jargon.

The first step would be to be familiar with the branch of law that\u2019s of highest interest to you. Get your feet wet with online courses. Get familiar with the jargon. Read top rated books. Review concepts regularly using Anki.\nDefinition: \u201cthe act of writing advertising or publicity copy.\u201d\nHow do I learn this skill?\nRead a lot. Write every day and publish regularly on blogs or on Medium. Use Grammarly. Refer to Thesaurus for definitions, synonyms, and antonyms. Avoid filler and boring words. Force yourself to learn a few words every day and use them. Journal your thoughts. Learn the art of storytelling.\nDefinition: \u201cof, relating to, or used in selling.\u201d\nHow do I learn this skill?\nLike Copywriting, learn the art of storytelling. Take speech lessons. Attend Toastmasters events. Learn basic psychology concepts for selling. Read \u201cHow to Win Friends and Influence People\u201d. Start a small eCommerce site and source your products from abroad. Get familiar with these 25 sales strategies.\nDefinition: \u201cthe business of inducing the public to have understanding for and goodwill toward a person, firm, or institution.\u201d\nHow do I learn this skill?\nLearn about what PR firms do. Learn how to approach people online. Learn how to approach people offline. If you plan to do it on your own, learn these 11 concepts. Read books. Learn to write press releases. Do an online course.\nThe above skills surely will make you wealthier, but what about richness in love, health, and happiness? To some degree, and depending on your personality, it may help.\nMoney doesn\u2019t personally make me happier. It doesn\u2019t make me love more, or better. What does, however, is the process of learning new skills.\nAs such, you should also learn skills that contribute to your personal love, health, and happiness. This is only for you to discover. The more you try, the more you\u2019ll understand what it is for you.\nWhat other concrete skills should you learn then?\nIn \u201cThe 3 Most Important Skills to Learn Now to Thrive in 2019\u201d, I explain how important \u201cgetting to action\u201d, \u201cbecoming adaptable\u201d, and \u201clearning to learn\u201d are to make you thrive. And you know what? When you thrive, you become rich on all pillars of life.\nLearn the three skills above, then everything else will be so much easier, including learning the seven skills of wealthy people from the previous section.\nContinuous learning forces the habit of thinking and adapting to any situation. The more you know, the more you\u2019ll manage to maintain sustained wealth. As such, to build wealth, learn these valuable skills:\nTo help with those and any other future skills, learn to Get to Action, Become Adaptable, and Learn to Learn.\nUltimately, being rich is not a once-in-a-lifetime mission. It\u2019s something you must keep chipping away at, slowly but surely. Things change constantly, and the rich continuously learn new skills to adapt to the new realities of the world. Remember, the only constant in life is change.\nWanna be rich?

Created 20 years ago, it\u2019s gone a very long way since its humble beginnings.\nBeing the first, and the only scripting language that was supported natively by web browsers, it simply stuck.\nIn the beginnings, it was not nearly as powerful as it is today, and it was mainly used for fancy animations \ud83d\ude06 and the marvel known at the time as Dynamic HTML (DHTML).\nWith the growing needs that the web platform demands, JavaScript had the responsibility to grow as well, to accommodate the needs of one of the most widely used ecosystems of the world.\nMany things were introduced in the platform, with browser APIs, but the language grew quite a lot as well.\nJavaScript is now widely also used outside the browser. The rise of Node.js in the last few years unlocked back-end development, once the domain of Java, Ruby, Python, PHP, and more traditional server-side languages.\nJavaScript is now also the language powering databases and many more applications. It\u2019s even possible to develop embedded applications, mobile apps, TV sets apps and much more. What started as a tiny language inside the browser is now the most popular language in the world.\nJavaScript is a programming language that is:\nIn case you\u2019re wondering, JavaScript has nothing to do with Java, it\u2019s an unfortunate name choice but we have to live with it.\nLet me introduce the term ECMAScript here. We have a complete guide dedicated to ECMAScript where you can dive into it more, but to start with, you just need to know that ECMAScript (also called ES) is the name of the JavaScript standard.\nJavaScript is an implementation of that standard. That\u2019s why you\u2019ll hear about ES6, ES2015, ES2016, ES2017, ES2018 and so on.\nFor a very long time, the version of JavaScript that all browsers ran was ECMAScript 3. Version 4 was canceled due to feature creep (they were trying to add too many things at once). While ES5 was a huge version for JavaScript, ES2015, also called ES6, was huge as well.\nSince then, the ones in charge decided to release one version per year, to avoid having too much time idle between releases, and have a faster feedback loop.\nCurrently, the latest approved JavaScript version is ES2017.\nWhenever you read about JavaScript you\u2019ll inevitably see one of these terms:\nWhat do they mean?\nThey are all referring to a standard, called ECMAScript.\nECMAScript is the standard upon which JavaScript is based, and it\u2019s often abbreviated to ES.\nBeside JavaScript, other languages implement(ed) ECMAScript, including:\nBut of course, JavaScript is the most popular and widely used implementation of ES.\nWhy this odd name? Ecma International is a Swiss standards association who is in charge of defining international standards.\nWhen JavaScript was created, it was presented by Netscape and Sun Microsystems to Ecma and they gave it the name ECMA-262 alias ECMAScript.\nThis press release by Netscape and Sun Microsystems (the maker of Java) might help figure out the name choice, which might include legal and branding issues by Microsoft which was in the committee, according to Wikipedia.\nAfter IE9, Microsoft stopped branding its ES support in browsers as JScript and started calling it JavaScript (at least, I could not find references to it any more).\nSo as of 201x, the only popular language supporting the ECMAScript spec is JavaScript.\nThe current ECMAScript version is ES2018. It was released in June 2018.\nHistorically, JavaScript editions have been standardized during the summer, so we can expect ECMAScript 2019 to be released in summer 2019, but this is just speculation.\nTC39 is the committee that evolves JavaScript.\nThe members of TC39 are companies involved in JavaScript and browser vendors, including Mozilla, Google, Facebook, Apple, Microsoft, Intel, PayPal, SalesForce and others.\nEvery standard version proposal must go through various stages, which are explained here.\nI found it puzzling why sometimes an ES version is referenced by edition number and sometimes by year.\nBefore ES2015, ECMAScript specifications were commonly called by their edition. So ES5 is the official name for the ECMAScript specification update published in 2009.\nWhy does this happen? During the process that led to ES2015, the name was changed from ES6 to ES2015, but since this was done late, people still referenced it as ES6, and the community has not left the edition naming behind - the world is still calling ES releases by edition number.\nThis table should clear things up a bit:\nES.Next is a name that always indicates the next version of JavaScript.\nAt the time of writing, ES9 has been released, and ES.Next is ES10\nECMAScript 2015, also known as ES6, is a fundamental version of the ECMAScript standard.\nPublished 4 years after the latest standard revision, ECMAScript 5.1, it also marked the switch from edition number to year number.\nSo it should not be named ES6 (although everyone calls it as such) but ES2015 instead.\nSince this long time passed between ES5.1 and ES6, the release is full of important new features and major changes in suggested best practices in developing JavaScript programs. To understand how fundamental ES2015 is, just keep in mind that with this version, the specification document went from 250 pages to ~600.\nThe most important changes in ES2015 include:\nI\u2019ll cover each of them in a dedicated section here in this guide. So let\u2019s get started.\nArrow functions have changed how most JavaScript code looks (and works).\nVisually, it\u2019s a simple and welcome change, from:\nto\nAnd if the function body is a one-liner, just:\nAlso, if you have a single parameter, you could write:\nThis is not a breaking change, as regular functions will continue to work just as before.\nThe this scope with arrow functions is inherited from the context.\nWith regular functions, this always refers to the nearest function, while with arrow functions this problem is removed, and you won't need to write var that = this ever again.\nPromises allow us to eliminate the famous \u201ccallback hell\u201d, although they introduce a bit more complexity (which has been solved in ES2017 with async, a higher level construct).\nPromises have been used by JavaScript developers well before ES2015, with many different library implementations (for example, jQuery, q, deferred.js, vow...). The standard created a common ground across the differences.\nBy using promises, you can rewrite this code\nas\nGenerators are a special kind of function with the ability to pause themselves, and resume later, allowing other code to run in the meantime.\nThe code decides that it has to wait, so it lets other code \u201cin the queue\u201d run, and keeps the right to resume its operations \u201cwhen the thing it\u2019s waiting for\u201d is done.\nAll this is done with a single, simple keyword: yield. When a generator contains that keyword, the execution is halted.\nA generator can contain many yield keywords, thus halting itself multiple times, and it's identified by the *function keyword, which is not to be confused with the pointer dereference operator used in lower level programming languages such as C, C++ or Go.\nGenerators enable whole new paradigms of programming in JavaScript, allowing:\nHere is an example of a generator which explains how it all works.\nWe initialize it with\nThen we start the iterator on our generator:\nThis first iteration starts the iterator. The code returns this object:\nWhat happens is: the code runs the function, with input = 10as it was passed in the generator constructor. It runs until it reaches the yield, and returns the content of yield: input / 2 = 5. So we get a value of 5, and the indication that the iteration is not done (the function is just paused).\nIn the second iteration we pass the value 7:\nand what we get back is:\n7 was placed as the value of doubleThat.\nWe then reach the second yield, and that returns doubleThat, so the returned value is 14.\nIn the next, and last, iteration, we pass in 100\nand in return we get\nAs the iteration is done (no more yield keywords found), we just return (input * doubleThat * another) which amounts to 10 * 14 * 100.\nvar is traditionally function scoped.\nlet is a new variable declaration which is block scoped.\nThis means that declaring let variables in a for loop, inside an if or in a plain block is not going to let that variable \"escape\" the block, while vars are hoisted up to the function definition.\nconst is just like let, but immutable.\nIn JavaScript moving forward, you\u2019ll see little to no var declarations any more, just let and const.\nconst in particular, maybe surprisingly, is very widely used nowadays with immutability being very popular.\nTraditionally JavaScript was the only mainstream language with prototype-based inheritance. Programmers switching to JavaScript from class-based languages found it puzzling, but ES2015 introduced classes, which are just syntactic sugar over the inner working of JavaScript, but change how we build JavaScript programs.\nNow, inheritance is very easy and resembles other object-oriented programming languages:\nThe above program prints \u201cHello, I am Tom Cruise. I am an actor.\u201d\nClasses do not have explicit class variable declarations, but you must initialize any variable in the constructor.\nClasses have a special method called constructor which is called when a class is initialized via new.\nThe parent class can be referenced using super().\nA getter for a property can be declared as\nSetters are written in the same way:\nBefore ES2015, there were at least 3 major competing module standards, which fragmented the community:\nES2015 standardized these into a common format.\nImporting is done via the import ... from ... construct:\nYou can write modules and export anything to other modules using the export keyword:\nTemplate literals are a new syntax to create strings:\nThey provide a way to embed expressions into strings, effectively interpolating the values, by using the ${a_variable} syntax:\nYou can perform more complex expressions as well:\nand strings can span over multiple lines:\nCompare how we used to do multiline strings pre-ES2015:\nFunctions now support default parameters:\nYou can expand an array, an object or a string using the spread operator ....\nLet\u2019s start with an array example. Given the following:\nYou can create a new array using\nYou can also create a copy of an array using\nThis works for objects as well. Clone an object with:\nUsing strings, the spread operator creates an array with each char in the string:\nThis operator has some pretty useful applications. The most important one is the ability to use an array as function argument in a very simple way:\nIn the past you could do this using f.apply(null, a) but that's not as nice and readable.\nGiven an object, you can extract just some values and put them into named variables:\nname and age contain the desired values.\nThe syntax also works on arrays:\nIn ES2015 Object Literals gained superpowers.\nInstead of doing\nyou can do\nA prototype can be specified with\nES5 back in 2009 introduced forEach() loops. While nice, they offered no way to break, like for loops always did.\nES2015 introduced the for-of loop, which combines the conciseness of forEach with the ability to break:\nMap and Set (and their respective garbage collected WeakMap and WeakSet) are the official implementations of two very popular data structures (introduced later on).\nES7, officially known as ECMAScript 2016, was finalized in June 2016.\nCompared to ES6, ES7 is a tiny release for JavaScript, containing just two features:\nThis feature introduces a more readable syntax for checking if an array contains an element.\nWith ES6 and lower, to check if an array contained an element you had to use indexOf, which checks the index in the array, and returns -1 if the element is not there.\nSince -1 is evaluated as a true value, you could not do for example\nWith this feature introduced in ES7 we can do\nThe exponentiation operator ** is the equivalent of Math.pow(), but brought into the language instead of being a library function.\nThis feature is a nice addition for Math intensive JavaScript applications.\nThe ** operator is standardized across many languages including Python, Ruby, MATLAB, Lua, Perl and many others.\nECMAScript 2017, edition 8 of the ECMA-262 Standard (also commonly called ES2017 or ES8), was finalized in June 2017.\nCompared to ES6, ES8 is a tiny release for JavaScript, but still it introduces very useful features:\nThe purpose of string padding is to add characters to a string, so it reaches a specific length.\nES2017 introduces two String methods: padStart() and padEnd().\nSample usage:\nThis method returns an array containing all the object own property values.\nUsage:\nObject.values() also works with arrays:\nThis method returns an array containing all the object own properties, as an array of [key, value] pairs.\nUsage:\nObject.entries() also works with arrays:\nThis method returns all own (non-inherited) property descriptors of an object.\nAny object in JavaScript has a set of properties, and each of these properties has a descriptor.\nA descriptor is a set of attributes of a property, and it\u2019s composed by a subset of the following:\nObject.getOwnPropertyDescriptors(obj) accepts an object, and returns an object with the set of descriptors.\nES2015 gave us Object.assign(), which copies all enumerable own properties from one or more objects, and returns a new object.\nHowever there is a problem with that, because it does not correctly copy properties with non-default attributes.\nIf an object for example just has a setter, it\u2019s not correctly copied to a new object using Object.assign().\nFor example, with\nThis won\u2019t work:\nBut this will work:\nAs you can see with a simple console test:\nperson2 misses the setter, as it was not copied over.\nThe same limitation goes for shallow cloning objects with Object.create().\nThis feature allows to have trailing commas in function declarations, and in functions calls:\nThis change will encourage developers to stop the ugly \u201ccomma at the start of the line\u201d habit.\nES2017 introduced the concept of async functions, and it\u2019s the most important change introduced in this ECMAScript edition.\nAsync functions are a combination of promises and generators to reduce the boilerplate around promises, and the \u201cdon\u2019t break the chain\u201d limitation of chaining promises.\nIt\u2019s a higher level abstraction over promises.\nWhen Promises were introduced in ES2015, they were meant to solve a problem with asynchronous code, and they did. But over the 2 years that separated ES2015 and ES2017, it was clear that promises could not be the final solution.\nPromises were introduced to solve the famous callback hell problem, but they introduced complexity of their own, and syntax complexity. They were good primitives around which a better syntax could be exposed to the developers: enter async functions.\nCode making use of asynchronous functions can be written as\nThe above code will print the following to the browser console:\nAsync functions can be chained very easily, and the syntax is much more readable than with plain promises:\nWebWorkers are used to create multithreaded programs in the browser.\nThey offer a messaging protocol via events. Since ES2017, you can create a shared memory array between web workers and their creator, using a SharedArrayBuffer.\nSince we don\u2019t know how much time writing to a shared memory portion takes to propagate, Atomics are a way to enforce that when reading a value and any kind of writing operation is completed.\nMore detail on this can be found in the spec proposal, which has since been implemented.\nES2018 is the latest version of the ECMAScript standard.\nWhat are the new things introduced in it?\nES6 introduced the concept of a rest element when working with array destructuring:\nand spread elements:\nES2018 introduces the same but for objects.\nRest properties:\nSpread properties allow to create a new object by combining the properties of the object passed after the spread operator:\nThe new construct for-await-of allows you to use an async iterable object as the loop iteration:\nSince this uses await, you can use it only inside async functions, like a normal await (see async/await)\nWhen a promise is fulfilled, successfully it calls the then()methods, one after another.\nIf something fails during this, the then() methods are jumped and the catch() method is executed.\nfinally() allow you to run some code regardless of the successful or unsuccessful execution of the promise:\nRegExp lookbehind assertions: match a string depending on what precedes it.\nThis is a lookahead: you use ?= to match a string that's followed by a specific substring:\n?! performs the inverse operation, matching if a string is not followed by a specific substring:\nLookaheads use the ?= symbol. They were already available.\nLookbehinds, a new feature, use ?<=.\nA lookbehind is negated using ?<!:\nIn a regular expression pattern you can use \\d to match any digit, \\s to match any character that's not a white space, \\w to match any alphanumeric character, and so on.\nThis new feature extends this concept to all Unicode characters introducing \\p{} and is negation \\P{}.\nAny unicode character has a set of properties. For example, Script determines the language family, ASCII is a boolean that's true for ASCII characters, and so on. You can put this property in the graph parentheses, and the regex will check for that to be true:\nASCII_Hex_Digit is another boolean property, that checks if the string only contains valid hexadecimal digits:\nThere are many other boolean properties, which you just check by adding their name in the graph parentheses, including Uppercase, Lowercase, White_Space, Alphabetic, Emoji and more:\nIn addition to those binary properties, you can check any of the unicode character properties to match a specific value. In this example, I check if the string is written in the Greek or Latin alphabet:\nRead more about all the properties you can use directly on the proposal.\nIn ES2018 a capturing group can be assigned to a name, rather than just being assigned a slot in the resulting array:\nThe s flag, short for single line, causes the . to match new line characters as well. Without it, the dot matches regular characters but not the new line:\nJavaScript Coding Style is the set of conventions used when using JavaScript.\nCoding style is an agreement with yourself and your team, to keep consistency on a project.\nAnd if you don\u2019t have a team, it\u2019s an agreement with yourself, to always keep your code up to your standards.\nHaving fixed rules on your code writing format helps a lot in order to have more readable and manageable code.\nThere are a quite a few of them around, here are the 2 most common ones in the JavaScript world:\nIt\u2019s up to you to follow one of those, or create your own style guide.\nEven if you prefer a set of styles, when working on a project you should use that project\u2019s style.\nAn Open Source project on GitHub might follow a set of rules, another project you work on with a team might follow an entirely different one.\nPrettier is an awesome tool that enforces code formatting, so you should use it.\nWe always use the latest ES version. Use Babel if old browser support is necessary.\nif\nfor: Always initialize the length in the initialization to cache it, don\u2019t insert it in the condition. Avoid using for in except with used in conjunction with .hasOwnProperty(). Prefer for of:\nwhile\ndo\nswitch\ntry\nNow we\u2019ll take a deep dive into the building blocks of JavaScript: unicode, semicolons, white space, case sensitivity, comments, literals, identifiers and reserved words\nJavaScript is written in Unicode. This means you can use Emojis as variable names. \ud83d\ude03 \ud83d\ude27 \ud83d\ude32 But more importantly, you can write identifiers in any language, for example Japanese or Chinese, with some rules.\nJavaScript has a very C-like syntax, and you might see lots of code samples that feature semicolons at the end of each line.\nSemicolons aren\u2019t mandatory, and JavaScript does not have any problems with code that does not use them. Lately many developers, especially those coming from languages that do not have semicolons, started avoiding using them.\nYou just need to avoid doing strange things like typing statements on multiple lines\nOr starting a line with parentheses ([ or () and you'll be safe 99.9% of the times (and your linter will warn you).\nIt\u2019s up to personal preference, and lately I have decided to never add useless semicolons, so within this article you\u2019ll never see them.\nJavaScript does not consider white space meaningful. Spaces and line breaks can be added in any fashion you might like, even though this is in theory.\nIn practice, you will most likely keep a well defined style and adhere to what people commonly use, and enforce this using a linter or a style tool such as Prettier.\nFor example, I like to always indent with 2 characters.\nJavaScript is case sensitive. A variable named something is different from Something.\nThe same goes for any identifier.\nYou can use two kind of comments in JavaScript:\nThe first can span over multiple lines and needs to be closed.\nThe second comments everything that\u2019s on its right, on the current line.\nWe define as literal a value that is written in the source code, for example a number, a string, a boolean or also more advanced constructs, like Object Literals or Array Literals:\nAn identifier is a sequence of characters that can be used to identify a variable, a function, an object. It can start with a letter, the dollar sign $ or an underscore _, and it can contain digits. Using Unicode, a letter can be any allowed char, for example an emoji \ud83d\ude04.\nThe dollar sign is commonly used to reference DOM elements.\nYou can\u2019t use as identifiers any of the following words because they are reserved by the language.\nA variable is a literal assigned to an identifier, so you can reference and use it later in the program. We\u2019ll learn how to declare one with JavaScript.\nA variable is a literal assigned to an identifier, so you can reference and use it later in the program.\nVariables in JavaScript do not have any type attached. Once you assign a specific literal type to a variable, you can later reassign the variable to host any other type, without type errors or any issue.\nThis is why JavaScript is sometimes referenced as \u201cuntyped\u201d.\nA variable must be declared before you can use it. There are 3 ways to do it: using var, let or const. Those 3 ways differ in how you can interact with the variable later on.\nUntil ES2015, var was the only construct available for defining variables.\nIf you forget to add var you will be assigning a value to an undeclared variable, and the results could vary.\nIn modern environments, with strict mode enabled, you will get an error. In older environments (or with strict mode disabled) this will simply initialize the variable and assign it to the global object.\nIf you don\u2019t initialize the variable when you declare it, it will have the undefined value until you assign a value to it.\nYou can redeclare the variable many times, overriding it:\nYou can also declare multiple variables at once in the same statement:\nThe scope is the portion of code where the variable is visible.\nA variable initialized with var outside of any function is assigned to the global object, has a global scope and is visible everywhere. A variable initialized with var inside a function is assigned to that function, it's local and is visible only inside it, just like a function parameter.\nAny variable defined into a function with the same name of a global variable takes precedence over the global variable, shadowing it.\nIt\u2019s important to understand that a block (identified by a pair of curly braces) does not define a new scope. A new scope is only created when a function is created, because var does not have block scope, but function scope.\nInside a function, any variable defined in it is visible throughout all the function code, even if the variable is declared at the end of the function it can still be referenced in the beginning, because JavaScript before executing the code actually moves all variables on top (something that is called hoisting). To avoid confusion, always declare variables at the beginning of a function.\nlet is a new feature introduced in ES2015 and it's essentially a block scoped version of var. Its scope is limited to the block, statement or expression where it's defined, and all the contained inner blocks.\nModern JavaScript developers might choose to only use let and completely discard the use of var.\nDefining let outside of any function - contrary to var - does not create a global variable.\nVariables declared with var or let can be changed later on in the program, and reassigned. A once a const is initialized, its value can never be changed again, and it can't be reassigned to a different value.\nWe can\u2019t assign a different literal to the a const. We can however mutate a if it's an object that provides methods that mutate its contents.\nconst does not provide immutability, just makes sure that the reference can't be changed.\nconst has block scope, same as let.\nModern JavaScript developers might choose to always use const for variables that don't need to be reassigned later in the program.\nYou might sometimes read that JS is untyped, but that\u2019s incorrect. It\u2019s true that you can assign all sorts of different types to a variable, but JavaScript has types. In particular, it provides primitive types, and object types.\nPrimitive types are\nAnd two special types:\nLet\u2019s see them in detail in the next sections.\nInternally, JavaScript has just one type for numbers: every number is a float.\nA numeric literal is a number represented in the source code, amd depending on how it\u2019s written, it can be an integer literal or a floating point literal.\nIntegers:\nFloats:\nA string type is a sequence of characters. It\u2019s defined in the source code as a string literal, which is enclosed in quotes or double quotes\nStrings can span across multiple lines by using the backslash\nA string can contain escape sequences that can be interpreted when the string is printed, like \\n to create a new line. The backslash is also useful when you need to enter for example a quote in a string enclosed in quotes, to prevent the char to be interpreted as a closing quote:\nStrings can be joined using the + operator:\nIntroduced in ES2015, template strings are string literals that allow a more powerful way to define strings.\nYou can perform string substitution, embedding the result of any JavaScript expression:\nYou can have multiline strings easily:\nJavaScript defines two reserved words for booleans: true and false. Many comparision operations == === < > (and so on) return either one or the other.\nif, while statements and other control structures use booleans to determine the flow of the program.\nThey don\u2019t just accept true or false, but also accept truthy and falsy values.\nFalsy values, values interpreted as false, are\nAll the rest is considered a truthy value.\nnull is a special value that indicates the absence of a value.\nIt\u2019s a common concept in other languages as well, can be known as nil or None in Python for example.\nundefined indicates that a variable has not been initialized and the value is absent.\nIt\u2019s commonly returned by functions with no return value. When a function accepts a parameter but that's not set by the caller, it's undefined.\nTo detect if a value is undefined, you use the construct:\nAnything that\u2019s not a primitive type is an object type.\nFunctions, arrays and what we call objects are object types. They are special on their own, but they inherit many properties of objects, like having properties and also having methods that can act on those properties.\nExpressions are units of code that can be evaluated and resolve to a value. Expressions in JS can be divided in categories.\nUnder this category go all expressions that evaluate to a number:\nExpressions that evaluate to a string:\nUnder this category go variable references, literals and constants:\nbut also some language keywords:\nLogical expressions make use of logical operators and resolve to a boolean value:\nThe syntax for calling a function or method\nJavaScript is quite unique in the popular programming languages landscape because of its use of prototypal inheritance. Let\u2019s find out what that means.\nWhile most object-oriented languages use a class-based inheritance model, JavaScript is based on the prototype inheritance model.\nWhat does this mean?\nEvery single JavaScript object has a property, called prototype, which points to a different object.\nThis different object is the object prototype.\nOur object uses that object prototype to inherit properties and methods.\nSay you have an object created using the object literal syntax:\nOr one created with the new Object syntax:\nIn any case, the prototype of car is Object:\nIf you initialize an array, which is an object:\nThe prototype is Array.\nYou can verify this by checking the Object.getPrototypeOf() and the Object.prototype.isPrototypeOf() methods:\nAll the properties and methods of the prototype are available to the object that has that prototype:\nObject.prototype is the base prototype of all the objects:\nIf you wonder what\u2019s the prototype of the Object.prototype, there is no prototype \u2014 it\u2019s `null`. It\u2019s a special snowflake. \u2744\ufe0f\nThe above example you saw is an example of the prototype chain at work.\nI can make an object that extends Array and any object I instantiate using it, will have Array and Object in its prototype chain and inherit properties and methods from all the ancestors.\nIn addition to using the new operator to create an object, or using the literals syntax for objects and arrays, you can instantiate an object using Object.create().\nThe first argument passed is the object used as prototype:\nYou can check the prototype of an object using the isPrototypeOf() method:\nPay attention because you can instantiate an array using\nand in this case Array.isPrototypeOf(list) is false, while Array.prototype.isPrototypeOf(list) is true.\nIn 2015 the ECMAScript 6 (ES6) standard introduced classes.\nBefore that, JavaScript only had a quite unique way to implement inheritance. Its prototypal inheritance, while in my opinion great, was different from any other popular programming language.\nPeople coming from Java or Python or other languages had a hard time understanding the intricacies of prototypal inheritance, so the ECMAScript committee decided to introduce a syntactic sugar on top of them, and resemble how classes-based inheritance works in other popular implementations.\nThis is important: JavaScript under the hoods is still the same, and you can access an object prototype in the usual way.\nThis is how a class looks.\nA class has an identifier, which we can use to create new objects using new ClassIdentifier().\nWhen the object is initialized, the constructor method is called, with any parameters passed.\nA class also has as many methods as it needs. In this case hello is a method and can be called on all objects derived from this class:\nA class can extend another class, and objects initialized using that class inherit all the methods of both classes.\nIf the inherited class has a method with the same name as one of the classes higher in the hierarchy, the closest method takes precedence:\nThe above program prints \u201cHello, I am Flavio. I am a programmer.\u201d\nClasses do not have explicit class variable declarations, but you must initialize any variable in the constructor.\nInside a class, you can reference the parent class calling super().\nNormally methods are defined on the instance, not on the class.\nStatic methods are executed on the class instead:\nJavaScript does not have a built-in way to define private or protected methods.\nThere are workarounds, but I won\u2019t describe them here.\nYou can add methods prefixed with get or set to create a getter and setter, which are two different pieces of code that are execute based on what you are doing: accessing the variable, or modifying its value.\nIf you only have a getter, the property cannot be set, and any attempt at doing so will be ignored:\nIf you only have a setter, you can change the value but not access it from the outside:\nWhen the code runs into an unexpected problem, the idiomatic JavaScript way to handle this situation is through exceptions.\nAn exception is created using the throw keyword:\nWhere value can be any JavaScript value including a string, a number or an object.\nAs soon as JavaScript executes this line, the normal program flow is halted and the control is held back to the nearest exception handler.\nAn exception handler is a try/catch statement.\nAny exception raised in the lines of code included in the tryblock is handled in the corresponding catch block:\ne in this example is the exception value.\nYou can add multiple handlers, that can catch different kinds of errors.\nTo complete this statement JavaScript has another statement called finally, which contains code that is executed regardless of the program flow, if the exception was handled or not, if there was an exception or if there wasn't:\nYou can use finally without a catch block, to serve as a way to clean up any resource you might have opened in the tryblock, like files or network requests:\ntry blocks can be nested, and an exception is always handled in the nearest catch block:\nIf an exception is raised in the inner try, it's handled in the outer catch block.\nJavaScript semicolons are optional. I personally like to avoid using semicolons in my code, but many people prefer them.\nSemicolons in JavaScript divide the community. Some prefer to use them always, no matter what. Others like to avoid them.\nAfter using semicolons for years, in the fall of 2017 I decided to try avoiding them as needed, and I did set up Prettier to automatically remove semicolons from my code, unless there is a particular code construct that requires them.\nNow I find it natural to avoid semicolons, I think the code looks better and it\u2019s cleaner to read.\nThis is all possible because JavaScript does not strictly require semicolons. When there is a place where a semicolon was needed, it adds it behind the scenes.\nThe process that does this is called Automatic Semicolon Insertion.\nIt\u2019s important to know the rules that power semicolons, to avoid writing code that will generate bugs because does not behave like you expect.\nThe JavaScript parser will automatically add a semicolon when, during the parsing of the source code, it finds these particular situations:\nBased on those rules, here are some examples.\nTake this:\nYou\u2019ll get the error Uncaught TypeError: Cannot read property 'forEach' of undefined because based on rule 1 JavaScript tries to interpret the code as\nSuch a piece of code:\nprints \"3\".\nInstead, the above code raises a TypeError: b is not a function exception, because JavaScript tries to interpret it as\nAnother example based on rule 4:\nYou\u2019d expect the return value of this immediately-invoked function to be an object that contains the color property, but it's not. Instead, it's undefined, because JavaScript inserts a semicolon after return.\nInstead you should put the opening bracket right after return:\nYou\u2019d think this code shows \u20180\u2019 in an alert:\nbut it shows 2 instead, because JavaScript per rule 1 interprets it as:\nBe careful. Some people are very opinionated on semicolons. I don\u2019t care honestly, the tool gives us the option not to use it, so we can avoid semicolons.\nI\u2019m not suggesting anything, other than making your own decision.\nWe just need to pay a bit of attention, even if most of the times those basic scenarios never show up in your code.\nPick some rules:\nAnd ultimately, always test your code to make sure it does what you want.\nNow we\u2019ll go over the quotes allowed in JavaScript and their unique features.\nJavaScript allows you to use 3 types of quotes:\nThe first 2 are essentially the same:\nThere\u2019s little to no difference in using one or the other. The only difference lies in having to escape the quote character you use to delimit the string:\nThere are various style guides that recommend always using one style vs the other.\nI personally prefer single quotes all the time, and use double quotes only in HTML.\nBackticks are a recent addition to JavaScript, since they were introduced with ES6 in 2015.\nThey have a unique feature - they allow multiline strings.\nMultiline strings are also possible using regular strings, using escape characters:\nUsing backticks (the key at the left of the number 1 on the keyboard), you can avoid using an escape character:\nNot just that. You can interpolate variables using the ${} syntax:\nThose are called Template Literals.\nIntroduced in ES2015, aka ES6, Template Literals offer a new way to declare strings, but also some new interesting constructs which are already widely popular.\nTemplate Literals are a new ES2015 / ES6 feature that allow you to work with strings in a novel way compared to ES5 and below.\nThe syntax at a first glance is very simple, just use backticks instead of single or double quotes:\nThey are unique because they provide a lot of features that normal strings built with quotes, in particular:\nLet\u2019s dive into each of these in detail.\nPre-ES6, to create a string spanned over two lines you had to use the \\ character at the end of a line:\nThis allows to create a string on 2 lines, but it\u2019s rendered on just one line:\nfirst part second part\nTo render the string on multiple lines as well, you explicitly need to add \\n at the end of each line, like this:\nor\nTemplate literals make multiline strings much simpler.\nOnce a template literal is opened with the backtick, you just press enter to create a new line, with no special characters, and it\u2019s rendered as-is:\nKeep in mind that space is meaningful, so doing this:\nIs going to create a string like this:\nAn easy way to fix this problem is by having an empty first line, and appending the trim() method right after the closing backtick, which will eliminate any space before the first character:\nTemplate literals provide an easy way to interpolate variables and expressions into strings.\nYou do so by using the ${...} syntax:\nInside the ${} you can add anything, even expressions:\nTagged templates is one feature that might sound less useful at first for you, but it\u2019s actually used by lots of popular libraries around, like Styled Components or Apollo, the GraphQL client/server library, so it\u2019s essential to understand how it works.\nIn Styled Components template tags are used to define CSS strings:\nIn Apollo template tags are used to define a GraphQL query schema:\nThe styled.button and gql template tags highlighted in those examples are just functions:\nThis function returns a string, which can be the result of any kind of computation.\nliterals is an array containing the template literal content tokenized by the expressions interpolations.\nexpressions contains all the interpolations.\nIf we take the example above:\nliterals is an array with two items. The first is something, the string until the first interpolation, and the second is an empty string, the space between the end of the first interpolation (we only have one) and the end of the string.\nexpressions in this case is an array with a single item, 6.\nA more complex example is:\nIn this case literals is an array where the first item is:\nthe second is:\nand the third is:\nexpressions in this case is an array with two items, x and 6.\nThe function that is passed those values can do anything with them, and this is the power of this kind of feature.\nThe most simple example is replicating what the string interpolation does, by simply joining literals and expressions:\nand this is how interpolate works:\nNow we\u2019ll learn all about functions, from the general overview to the tiny details that will improve how you use them.\nEverything in JavaScript happens in functions.\nA function is a block of code, self contained, that can be defined once and run any number of times you want.\nA function can optionally accept parameters, and returns one value.\nFunctions in JavaScript are objects, a special kind of object: function objects. Their superpower lies in the fact that they can be invoked.\nIn addition, functions are said to be first class functions because they can be assigned to a value, and they can be passed as arguments and used as a return value.\nLet\u2019s start with the \u201cold\u201d, pre-ES6/ES2015 syntax. Here\u2019s a function declaration:\nNow, in the post ES6/ES2015 world, referred to as a regular function\nFunctions can be assigned to variables (this is called a function expression):\nNamed function expressions are similar, but play nicer with the stack call trace, which is useful when an error occurs - it holds the name of the function:\nES6/ES2015 introduced arrow functions, which are especially nice to use when working with inline functions, as parameters or callbacks:\nArrow functions have an important difference from the other function definitions above, we\u2019ll see which one later as it\u2019s an advanced topic.\nA function can have one or more parameters.\nStarting with ES6/ES2015, functions can have default values for the parameters:\nThis allows you to call a function without filling all the parameters:\nES2018 introduced trailing commas for parameters, a feature that helps reducing bugs due to missing commas when moving around parameters (e.g. moving the last in the middle):\nYou can wrap all your arguments in an array, and use the spread operator when calling the function:\nWith many parameters, remembering the order can be difficult. Using objects, destructuring allows to keep the parameter names:\nEvery function returns a value, which by default is undefined.\nAny function is terminated when its lines of code end, or when the execution flow finds a return keyword.\nWhen JavaScript encounters this keyword it exits the function execution and gives control back to its caller.\nIf you pass a value, that value is returned as the result of the function:\nYou can only return one value.\nTo simulate returning multiple values, you can return an object literal, or an array, and use a destructuring assignment when calling the function.\nUsing arrays:\nUsing objects:\nFunctions can be defined inside other functions:\nThe nested function is scoped to the outside function, and cannot be called from the outside.\nWhen used as object properties, functions are called methods:\nThere\u2019s an important behavior of Arrow Functions vs regular Functions when used as object methods. Consider this example:\nThe stop() method does not work as you would expect.\nThis is because the handling of this is different in the two functions declarations style. this in the arrow function refers to the enclosing function context, which in this case is the window object:\nthis, which refers to the host object using function()\nThis implies that arrow functions are not suitable to be used for object methods and constructors (arrow function constructors will actually raise a TypeError when called).\nAn IIFE is a function that\u2019s immediately executed right after its declaration:\nYou can assign the result to a variable:\nThey are very handy, as you don\u2019t need to separately call the function after its definition.\nJavaScript before executing your code reorders it according to some rules.\nFunctions in particular are moved at the top of their scope. This is why it\u2019s legal to write\nInternally, JavaScript moves the function before its call, along with all the other functions found in the same scope:\nNow, if you use named function expressions, since you\u2019re using variables something different happens. The variable declaration is hoisted, but not the value, so not the function.\nNot going to work:\nThis is because what happens internally is:\nThe same happens for let declarations. var declarations do not work either, but with a different error:\nThis is because var declarations are hoisted and initialized with undefined as a value, while const and let are hoisted but not initialized.\nArrow Functions are one of the most impactful changes in ES6/ES2015, and they are widely used nowadays. They slightly differ from regular functions. Let\u2019s see how below.\nI already introduced arrow functions above, but they are so important they need their own section.\nArrow functions were introduced in ES6 / ECMAScript 2015, and since their introduction they changed forever how JavaScript code looks (and works).\nIn my opinion this change was so welcome that you now rarely see in modern codebases the usage of the function keyword.\nVisually, it\u2019s a simple and welcome change, which allows you to write functions with a shorter syntax, from:\nto\nIf the function body contains just a single statement, you can omit the parentheses and write all on a single line:\nParameters are passed in the parentheses:\nIf you have one (and just one) parameter, you could omit the parentheses completely:\nThanks to this short syntax, arrow functions encourage the use of small functions.\nArrow functions allow you to have an implicit return: values are returned without having to use the return keyword.\nIt works when there is a on-line statement in the function body:\nAnother example, returning an object (remember to wrap the curly brackets in parentheses to avoid it being considered the wrapping function body brackets):\nthis is a concept that can be complicated to grasp, as it varies a lot depending on the context and also varies depending on the mode of JavaScript (strict mode or not).\nIt\u2019s important to clarify this concept because arrow functions behave very differently compared to regular functions.\nWhen defined as a method of an object, in a regular function this refers to the object, so you can do:\ncalling car.fullName() will return \"Ford Fiesta\".\nThe this scope with arrow functions is inherited from the execution context. An arrow function does not bind this at all, so its value will be looked up in the call stack, so in this code car.fullName() will not work, and will return the string \"undefined undefined\":\nDue to this, arrow functions are not suited as object methods.\nArrow functions cannot be used as constructors as well, when instantiating an object. It will raise a TypeError.\nThis is where regular functions should be used instead, when dynamic context is not needed.\nThis is also a problem when handling events. DOM Event listeners set this to be the target element, and if you rely on this in an event handler, a regular function is necessary:\nHere\u2019s a gentle introduction to the topic of closures, which are key to understanding how JavaScript functions work.\nIf you\u2019ve ever written a function in JavaScript, you\u2019ve already made use of closures.\nIt\u2019s a key topic to understand, which has implications for the things you can do.\nWhen a function is run, it\u2019s executed with the scope that was in place when it was defined, and not with the state that\u2019s in place when it is executed.\nThe scope basically is the set of variables which are visible.\nA function remembers its Lexical Scope, and it\u2019s able to access variables that were defined in the parent scope.\nIn short, a function has an entire baggage of variables it can access.\nLet me immediately give an example to clarify this.\nThis logs to the console Roger barked!, as expected.\nWhat if you want to return the action instead:\nThis snippet also logs to the console Roger barked!.\nLet\u2019s make one last example, which reuses prepareBark for two different dogs:\nThis prints\nAs you can see, the state of the variable say is linked to the function that's returned from prepareBark().\nAlso notice that we redefine a new say variable the second time we call prepareBark(), but that does not affect the state of the first prepareBark() scope.\nThis is how a closure works: the function that\u2019s returned keeps the original state in its scope.\nJavaScript arrays over time got more and more features, and sometimes it\u2019s tricky to know when to use some construct vs another. This section aims to explain what you should use, as of 2018.\nDon\u2019t use the old syntax (just use it for typed arrays)\nIterates a until f() returns false\nIterates a until f() returns true\nIterates a and builds a new array with the result of executing f() on each a element\nIterates a and builds a new array with elements of a that returned true when executing f() on each a element\nreduce() executes a callback function on all the items of the array and allows to progressively compute a result. If initialValue is specified, accumulator in the first iteration will equal to that value.\nExample:\nIterates f on a without a way to stop\nExample:\nIterates a, can be stopped using return or break and an iteration can be skipped using continue\nGetting the iterator from an array returns an iterator of values\n.entries() returns an iterator of key/value pairs\n.keys() allows to iterate on the keys:\n.next() returns undefined when the array ends. You can also detect if the iteration ended by looking at it.next() which returns a value, done pair. done is always false until the last element, which returns true.\nFrom the end\nFrom the beginning\nAt a random position\nDo not use remove() as it leaves behind undefined values.\nReturns the index of the first matching item found, or -1 if not found\nReturns the index of the last matching item found, or -1 if not found\nReturns the first item that returns true. Returns undefined if not found.\nA commonly used syntax is:\nThe above line will return the first element in the array that has id === my_id.\nfindIndex returns the index of the first item that returns true, and if not found, it returns undefined:\nReturns true if a contains value.\nReturns true if a contains value after the position i.\nSort alphabetically (by ASCII value - 0-9A-Za-z)\nSort by a custom function\nReverse the order of an array\nReturns a string representation of an array\nReturns a string concatenation of the array elements. Pass a parameter to add a custom separator:\nJavaScript provides many ways to iterate through loops. This section explains all the various loop possibilities in modern JavaScript with a small example and the main properties.\nIntroduced in ES5. Given an array, you can iterate over its properties using list.forEach():\nUnfortunately you cannot break out of this loop.\nYou can interrupt a while loop using break:\nand you can jump to the next iteration using continue:\nYou can interrupt a while loop using break:\nand you can jump to the next iteration using continue:\nThe difference with do...while is that do...while always execute its cycle at least once.\nIterates all the enumerable properties of an object, giving the property names.\nES2015 introduced the for...of loop, which combines the conciseness of forEach with the ability to break:\nNotice the use of const. This loop creates a new scope in every iteration, so we can safely use that instead of let.\nThe difference with for...in is:\nJavaScript in the browser uses an event-driven programming model. Everything starts by following an event. This section provides an introduction to JavaScript events and how event handling works.\nJavaScript in the browser uses an event-driven programming model.\nEverything starts by following an event.\nThe event could be the DOM is loaded, or an asynchronous request that finishes fetching, or a user clicking an element or scrolling the page, or the user types on the keyboard.\nThere are a lot of different kind of events.\nYou can respond to any event using an Event Handler, which is just a function that\u2019s called when an event occurs.\nYou can register multiple handlers for the same event, and they will all be called when that event happens.\nJavaScript offers three ways to register an event handler:\nThis style of event handlers is very rarely used today, due to its constrains, but it was the only way in the early days of JavaScript:\nThis is common when an object has at most one event handler, as there is no way to add multiple handlers in this case:\nIt\u2019s most commonly used when handling XHR requests:\nYou can check if an handler is already assigned to a property using if ('onsomething' in window) {}.\nThis is the modern way. This method allows us to register as many handlers as we need, and it\u2019s the most popular you will find:\nYou can listen on window to intercept \"global\" events, like the usage of the keyboard, and you can listen on specific elements to check events happening on them, like a mouse click on a button.\nThis is why addEventListener is sometimes called on window, sometimes on a DOM element.\nAn event handler gets an Event object as the first parameter:\nThis object contains a lot of useful properties and methods, like:\n(see the full list).\nOther properties are provided by specific kind of events, as Event is an interface for different specific events:\nEach of those has a MDN page linked, so you can inspect all their properties.\nFor example when a KeyboardEvent happens, you can check which key was pressed, in a readable format (Escape, Enterand so on) by checking the key property:\nOn a mouse event we can check which mouse button was pressed:\nBubbling and capturing are the two models that events use to propagate.\nSuppose you DOM structure is\nYou want to track when users click on the button, and you have two event listeners, one on button, and one on #container. Remember, a click on a child element will always propagate to its parents, unless you stop the propagation (we\u2019ll see this later).\nThose event listeners will be called in order, and this order is determined by the event bubbling/capturing model used.\nBubbling means that the event propagates from the item that was clicked (the child) up to all its parent tree, starting from the nearest one.\nIn our example, the handler on button will fire before the #container handler.\nCapturing is the opposite: the outer event handlers are fired before the more specific handler, the one on button.\nBy default all events bubble.\nYou can choose to adopt event capturing by applying a third argument to addEventListener, setting it to true:\nNote that first all capturing event handlers are run.\nThen all the bubbling event handlers.\nThe order follows this principle: the DOM goes through all elements starting from the Window object, and goes to find the item that was clicked. While doing so, it calls any event handler associated with the event (capturing phase).\nOnce it reaches the target, it then repeats the journey up to the parents tree until the Window object, again calls the event handlers (bubbling phase).\nAn event on a DOM element will be propagated to all its parent elements tree, unless it\u2019s stopped.\nA click event on a will propagate to section and then body.\nYou can stop the propagation by calling the stopPropagation()method of an Event, usually at the end of the event handler:\nHere\u2019s a list of the most common events you will likely handle.\nload is fired on window and the body element when the page has finished loading.\nclick fires when a mouse button is clicked. dblclick when the mouse is clicked two times. Of course in this case click is fired just before this event. mousedown, mousemove and mouseup can be used in combination to track drag-and-drop events. Be careful with mousemove, as it fires many times during the mouse movement (see throttling later)\nkeydown fires when a keyboard button is pressed (and any time the key repeats while the button stays pressed). keyup is fired when the key is released.\nThe scroll event is fired on window every time you scroll the page. Inside the event handler you can check the current scrolling position by checking window.scrollY (Y Axis).\nKeep in mind that this event is not a one-time thing. It fires a lot of times during scrolling, not just at the end or beginning of the scrolling, so don\u2019t do any heavy computation or manipulation in the handler - use throttling instead.\nAs we mentioned above, mousemove and scroll are two events that are not fired one-time per event, but rather they continuously call their event handler function during all the duration of the action.\nThis is because they provide coordinates so you can track what\u2019s happening.\nIf you perform a complex operation in the event handler, you will affect the performance and cause a sluggish experience to your site users.\nLibraries that provide throttling like Lodash implement it in 100+ lines of code, to handle every possible use case. A simple and easy to understand implementation is this, which uses setTimeout to cache the scroll event every 100ms:\nThe Event Loop is one of the most important aspects to understand about JavaScript.\nThis section aims to explain the inner details of how JavaScript works with a single thread, and how it handles asynchronous functions.\nYour JavaScript code runs single threaded. There is just one thing happening at a time.\nThis is a limitation that\u2019s actually very helpful, as it simplifies a lot how you program without worrying about concurrency issues.\nYou just need to pay attention to how you write your code and avoid anything that could block the thread, like synchronous network calls or infinite loops.\nIn general, in most browsers there is an event loop for every browser tab, to make every process isolated and avoid a web page with infinite loops or heavy processing to block your entire browser.\nThe environment manages multiple concurrent event loops, to handle API calls for example. Web Workers run in their own event loop as well.\nYou mainly need to be concerned that your code will run on a single event loop, and write code with this thing in mind to avoid blocking it.\nAny JavaScript code that takes too long to return back control to the event loop will block the execution of any JavaScript code in the page, even block the UI thread, and the user cannot click around, scroll the page, and so on.\nAlmost all the I/O primitives in JavaScript are non-blocking. Network requests, Node.js filesystem operations, and so on. Being blocking is the exception, and this is why JavaScript is based so much on callbacks, and more recently on promises and async/await.\nThe call stack is a LIFO queue (Last In, First Out).\nThe event loop continuously checks the call stack to see if there\u2019s any function that needs to run.\nWhile doing so, it adds any function call it finds, to the call stack and executes each one in order.\nYou know the error stack trace you might be familiar with, in the debugger or in the browser console? The browser looks up the function names in the call stack to inform you which function originates the current call:\nLet\u2019s pick an example:\nThis code prints\nas expected.\nWhen this code runs, first foo() is called. Inside foo() we first call bar(), then we call baz().\nAt this point the call stack looks like this:\nThe event loop on every iteration looks if there\u2019s something in the call stack, and executes it:\nuntil the call stack is empty.\nThe above example looks normal, there\u2019s nothing special about it: JavaScript finds things to execute, runs them in order.\nLet\u2019s see how to defer a function until the stack is clear.\nThe use case of setTimeout(() => {}), 0) is to call a function, but execute it once every other function in the code has executed.\nTake this example:\nThis code prints, maybe surprisingly:\nWhen this code runs, first foo() is called. Inside foo() we first call setTimeout, passing bar as an argument, and we instruct it to run immediately as fast as it can, passing 0 as the timer. Then we call baz().\nAt this point the call stack looks like this:\nHere is the execution order for all the functions in our program:\nWhy is this happening?\nWhen setTimeout() is called, the Browser or Node.js start the timer. Once the timer expires, in this case immediately as we put 0 as the timeout, the callback function is put in the Message Queue.\nThe Message Queue is also where user-initiated events like click or keyboard events, or fetch responses are queued before your code has the opportunity to react to them. Or also DOM events like onLoad.\nThe loop gives priority to the call stack, and it first processes everything it finds in the call stack, and once there\u2019s nothing in there, it goes to pick up things in the event queue.\nWe don\u2019t have to wait for functions like setTimeout, fetch or other things to do their own work, because they are provided by the browser, and they live on their own threads. For example, if you set the setTimeout timeout to 2 seconds, you don't have to wait 2 seconds - the wait happens elsewhere.\nECMAScript 2015 introduced the concept of the Job Queue, which is used by Promises (also introduced in ES6/ES2015). It\u2019s a way to execute the result of an async function as soon as possible, rather than being put at the end of the call stack.\nPromises that resolve before the current function ends will be executed right after the current function.\nI find the analogy of a rollercoaster ride at an amusement park nicely explains it: the message queue puts you back in queue with after all the other people in the queue, while the job queue is the fastpass ticket that lets you take another ride right after you finished the previous one.\nFor Example:\nThis prints\nThat\u2019s a big difference between Promises (and Async/await, which is built on promises) and plain old asynchronous functions through setTimeout() or other platform APIs.\nJavaScript is synchronous by default, and is single threaded. This means that code cannot create new threads and run in parallel. Let\u2019s learn what asynchronous code means and how it looks.\nComputers are asynchronous by design.\nAsynchronous means that things can happen independently of the main program flow.\nIn the current consumer computers, every program runs for a specific time slot, and then it stops its execution to let another program continue its execution. This thing runs in a cycle so fast that\u2019s impossible to notice, and we think our computers run many programs simultaneously, but this is an illusion (except on multiprocessor machines).\nPrograms internally use interrupts, a signal that\u2019s emitted to the processor to gain the attention of the system.\nI won\u2019t go into the internals of this, but just keep in mind that it\u2019s normal for programs to be asynchronous, and halt their execution until they need attention, and the computer can execute other things in the meantime. When a program is waiting for a response from the network, it cannot halt the processor until the request finishes.\nNormally, programming languages are synchronous, and some provide a way to manage asynchronicity, in the language or through libraries. C, Java, C#, PHP, Go, Ruby, Swift, Python, they are all synchronous by default. Some of them handle async by using threads, spawning a new process.\nJavaScript is synchronous by default and is single threaded. This means that code cannot create new threads and run in parallel.\nLines of code are executed in series, one after another, for example:\nBut JavaScript was born inside the browser, its main job, in the beginning, was to respond to user actions, like onClick, onMouseOver, onChange, onSubmit and so on. How could it do this with a synchronous programming model?\nThe answer was in its environment. The browser provides a way to do it by providing a set of APIs that can handle this kind of functionality.\nMore recently, Node.js introduced a non-blocking I/O environment to extend this concept to file access, network calls and so on.\nYou can\u2019t know when a user is going to click a button, so what you do is, you define an event handler for the click event. This event handler accepts a function, which will be called when the event is triggered:\nThis is the so-called callback.\nA callback is a simple function that\u2019s passed as a value to another function, and will only be executed when the event happens. We can do this because JavaScript has first-class functions, which can be assigned to variables and passed around to other functions (called higher-order functions)\nIt\u2019s common to wrap all your client code in a load event listener on the window object, which runs the callback function only when the page is ready:\nCallbacks are used everywhere, not just in DOM events.\nOne common example is by using timers:\nXHR requests also accept a callback. In this example, by assigning a function to a property that will be called when a particular event occurs (in this case, the state of the request changes):\nHow do you handle errors with callbacks? One very common strategy is to use what Node.js adopted: the first parameter in any callback function is the error object: error-first callbacks\nIf there is no error, the object is null. If there is an error, it contains some description of the error and other information.\nCallbacks are great for simple cases!\nHowever every callback adds a level of nesting, and when you have lots of callbacks, the code starts to be complicated very quickly:\nThis is just a simple 4-levels code, but I\u2019ve seen much more levels of nesting and it\u2019s not fun.\nHow do we solve this?\nStarting with ES6, JavaScript introduced several features that help us with asynchronous code that do not involve using callbacks:\nPromises are one way to deal with asynchronous code in JavaScript, without writing too many callbacks in your code.\nA promise is commonly defined as a proxy for a value that will eventually become available.\nPromises are one way to deal with asynchronous code, without writing too many callbacks in your code.\nAlthough being around since years, they have been standardized and introduced in ES2015, and now they have been superseded in ES2017 by async functions.\nAsync functions use the promises API as their building block, so understanding them is fundamental even if in newer code you\u2019ll likely use async functions instead of promises.\nOnce a promise has been called, it will start in pending state. This means that the caller function continues the execution, while it waits for the promise to do its own processing, and give the caller function some feedback.\nAt this point, the caller function waits for it to either return the promise in a resolved state, or in a rejected state, but the function continues its execution while the promise does its work.\nIn addition to your own code and libraries code, promises are used by standard modern Web APIs such as:\nIt\u2019s unlikely that in modern JavaScript you\u2019ll find yourself not using promises, so let\u2019s start diving right into them.\nThe Promise API exposes a Promise constructor, which you initialize using new Promise():\nAs you can see the promise checks the done global constant, and if that's true, we return a resolved promise, otherwise a rejected promise.\nUsing resolve and reject we can communicate back a value, and in the above case we just return a string, but it could be an object as well.\nIn the last section, we introduced how a promise is created.\nNow let\u2019s see how the promise can be consumed or used.\nRunning checkIfItsDone() will execute the isItDoneYet()promise and will wait for it to resolve, using the then callback, and if there is an error, it will handle it in the catch callback.\nA promise can be returned to another promise, creating a chain of promises.\nA great example of chaining promises is given by the Fetch API, a layer on top of the XMLHttpRequest API, which we can use to get a resource and queue a chain of promises to execute when the resource is fetched.\nThe Fetch API is a promise-based mechanism, and calling fetch() is equivalent to defining our own promise using new Promise().\nIn this example, we call fetch() to get a list of TODO items from the todos.json file found in the domain root, and we create a chain of promises.\nRunning fetch() returns a response, which has many properties, and within those we reference:\nresponse also has a json() method, which returns a promise that will resolve with the content of the body processed and transformed into JSON.\nSo given those premises, this is what happens: the first promise in the chain is a function that we defined, called status(), that checks the response status and if it's not a success response (between 200 and 299), it rejects the promise.\nThis operation will cause the promise chain to skip all the chained promises listed and will skip directly to the catch() statement at the bottom, logging the Request failed text along with the error message.\nIf that succeeds instead, it calls the json() function we defined. Since the previous promise, when successful, returned the response object, we get it as an input to the second promise.\nIn this case, we return the data JSON processed, so the third promise receives the JSON directly:\nand we simply log it to the console.\nIn the example, in the previous section, we had a catch that was appended to the chain of promises.\nWhen anything in the chain of promises fails and raises an error or rejects the promise, the control goes to the nearest catch()statement down the chain.\nIf inside the catch() you raise an error, you can append a second catch() to handle it, and so on.\nIf you need to synchronize different promises, Promise.all()helps you define a list of promises, and execute something when they are all resolved.\nFor Example:\nThe ES2015 destructuring assignment syntax allows you to also do\nYou are not limited to using fetch of course, any promise is good to go.\nPromise.race() runs when the first of the promises you pass to it resolves, and it runs the attached callback just once, with the result of the first promise resolved.\nFor Example:\nNow we\u2019ll discover the modern approach to asynchronous functions in JavaScript. JavaScript evolved in a very short time from callbacks to Promises, and since ES2017, asynchronous JavaScript is even simpler with the async/await syntax.\nAsync functions are a combination of promises and generators, and basically, they are a higher level abstraction over promises. Let me repeat: async/await is built on promises.\nThey reduce the boilerplate around promises, and the \u201cdon\u2019t break the chain\u201d limitation of chaining promises.\nWhen Promises were introduced in ES2015, they were meant to solve a problem with asynchronous code, and they did, but over the 2 years that separated ES2015 and ES2017, it was clear that promises could not be the final solution.\nPromises were introduced to solve the famous callback hell problem, but they introduced complexity on their own, and syntax complexity.\nThey were good primitives around which a better syntax could be exposed to the developers, so when the time was right we got async functions.\nThey make the code look like it\u2019s synchronous, but it\u2019s asynchronous and non-blocking behind the scenes.\nAn async function returns a promise, like in this example:\nWhen you want to call this function you prepend await, and the calling code will stop until the promise is resolved or rejected. One caveat: the client function must be defined as async. Here's an example:\nThis is a simple example of async/await used to run a function asynchronously:\nThe above code will print the following to the browser console:\nPrepending the async keyword to any function means that the function will return a promise.\nEven if it\u2019s not doing so explicitly, it will internally make it return a promise.\nThis is why this code is valid:\nand it\u2019s the same as:\nAs you can see in the example above, our code looks very simple. Compare it to code using plain promises, with chaining and callback functions.\nAnd this is a very simple example, the major benefits will arise when the code is much more complex.\nFor example here\u2019s how you would get a JSON resource, and parse it, using promises:\nAnd here is the same functionality provided using await/async:\nAsync functions can be chained very easily, and the syntax is much more readable than with plain promises:\nWill print:\nDebugging promises is hard because the debugger will not step over asynchronous code.\nAsync/await makes this very easy because to the compiler it\u2019s just like synchronous code.\nThere is one feature of JavaScript that might cause a few headaches to developers, related to loops and scoping. We\u2019ll learn some tricks about loops and scoping with var and let.\nTake this example:\nIt basically iterates and for 5 times it adds a function to an array called operations. This function simply console logs the loop index variable i.\nLater it runs these functions.\nThe expected result here should be:\nbut actually what happens is this:\nWhy is this the case? Because of the use of var.\nSince var declarations are hoisted, the above code equals to\nSo, in the for-of loop, i is still visible, it's equal to 5 and every reference to i in the function is going to use this value.\nSo how should we do to make things work as we want?\nThe simplest solution is to use let declarations. Introduced in ES2015, they are a great help in avoiding some of the weird things about var declarations.\nSimply changing var to let in the loop variable is going to work fine:\nHere\u2019s the output:\nHow is this possible? This works because on every loop iteration i is created as a new variable each time, and every function added to the operations array gets its own copy of i.\nKeep in mind you cannot use const in this case, because there would be an error as for tries to assign a new value in the second iteration.\nAnother way to solve this problem was very common in pre-ES6 code, and it is called Immediately Invoked Function Expression (IIFE).\nIn this case you can wrap the entire function and bind i to it. Since in this way you're creating a function that immediately executes, you return a new function from it, so we can execute it later:\nWhen writing JavaScript code, you might want to delay the execution of a function. We\u2019ll discuss how to use setTimeout and setInterval to schedule functions in the future.\nWhen writing JavaScript code, you might want to delay the execution of a function.\nThis is the job of setTimeout. You specify a callback function to execute later, and a value expressing how later you want it to run, in milliseconds:\nThis syntax defines a new function. You can call whatever other function you want in there, or you can pass an existing function name, and a set of parameters:\nsetTimeout returns the timer id. This is generally not used, but you can store this id, and clear it if you want to delete this scheduled function execution:\nIf you specify the timeout delay to 0, the callback function will be executed as soon as possible, but after the current function execution:\nwill print before after.\nThis is especially useful to avoid blocking the CPU on intensive tasks and let other functions execute while performing a heavy calculation, by queuing functions in the scheduler.\nsetInterval is a function similar to setTimeout, with a difference: instead of running the callback function once, it will run it forever, at the specific time interval you specify (in milliseconds):\nThe function above runs every 2 seconds unless you tell it to stop, using clearInterval, passing it the interval id that setInterval returned:\nIt\u2019s common to call clearInterval inside the setInterval callback function, to let it auto-determine if it should run again or stop. For example this code runs something unless App.somethingIWait has the value arrived:\nsetInterval starts a function every n milliseconds, without any consideration about when a function finished its execution.\nIf a function takes always the same amount of time, it\u2019s all fine:\nMaybe the function takes different execution times, depending on network conditions for example:\nAnd maybe one long execution overlaps the next one:\nTo avoid this, you can schedule a recursive setTimeout to be called when the callback function finishes:\nto achieve this scenario:\nsetTimeout and setInterval are available in Node.js, through the Timers module.\nNode.js also provides setImmediate(), which is equivalent to using setTimeout(() => {}, 0), mostly used to work with the Node.js Event Loop.\nthis is a value that has different values depending on where it\u2019s used. Not knowing this tiny detail of JavaScript can cause a lot of headaches, so it\u2019s worth taking 5 minutes to learn all the tricks\nNot knowing this tiny detail of JavaScript can cause a lot of headaches, so it\u2019s worth taking 5 minutes to learn all the tricks.\nOutside any object, this in strict mode is always undefined.\nNotice I mentioned strict mode. If strict mode is disabled (the default state if you don\u2019t explicitly add 'use strict' on top of your file ), you are in the so-called sloppy mode, and this - unless some specific cases mentioned here below - has the value of the global object.\nWhich means window in a browser context.\nA method is a function attached to an object.\nYou can see it in various forms.\nHere\u2019s one:\nIn this case, using a regular function, this is automatically bound to the object.\nNote: the above method declaration is the same as drive: function() {..., but shorter:\nThe same works in this example:\nAn arrow function does not work in the same way, as it\u2019s lexically bound:\nYou cannot bind a value to an arrow function, like you do with normal functions.\nIt\u2019s simply not possible due to the way they work. this is lexically bound, which means its value is derived from the context where they are defined.\nJavaScript offers a few ways to map this to any object you want.\nUsing bind(), at the function declaration step:\nYou could also bind an existing object method to remap its this value:\nUsing call() or apply(), at the function invocation step:\nThe first parameter you pass to call() or apply() is always bound to this. The difference between call() and apply() is just that the second one wants an array as the arguments list, while the first accepts a variable number of parameters, which passes as function arguments.\nIn event handlers callbacks, this refers to the HTML element that received the event:\nYou can bind it using\nStrict Mode is an ES5 feature, and it\u2019s a way to make JavaScript behave in a better way \u2014 and in a different way, as enabling Strict Mode changes the semantics of the JavaScript language.\nIt\u2019s really important to know the main differences between JavaScript code in strict mode, and normal JavaScript, which is often referred as sloppy mode\nAnd in a different way, as enabling Strict Mode changes the semantics of the JavaScript language.\nIt\u2019s really important to know the main differences between JavaScript code in strict mode, and \u201cnormal\u201d JavaScript, which is often referred as sloppy mode.\nStrict Mode mostly removes functionality that was possible in ES3, and deprecated since ES5 (but not removed because of backwards compatibility requirements)\nStrict mode is optional. As with every breaking change in JavaScript, we can\u2019t simply change how the language behaves by default, because that would break gazillions of JavaScript around, and JavaScript puts a lot of effort into making sure 1996 JavaScript code still works today. It\u2019s a key of its success.\nSo we have the 'use strict' directive we need to use to enable Strict Mode.\nYou can put it at the beginning of a file, to apply it to all the code contained in the file:\nYou can also enable Strict Mode for an individual function, by putting 'use strict' at the beginning of the function body:\nThis is useful when operating on legacy code, where you don\u2019t have the time to test or the confidence to enable strict mode on the whole file.\nIf you assign a value to an undeclared variable, JavaScript by default creates that variable on the global object:\nTurning on Strict Mode, an error is raised if you try to do what we did above:\nJavaScript silently fails some conversion errors.\nIn Strict Mode, those silent errors now raise issues:\nThe same applies to Infinity, NaN, eval, arguments and more.\nIn JavaScript you can define a property of an object to be not writable, by using\nIn strict mode, you can\u2019t override this value, while in sloppy mode that\u2019s possible:\nThe same works for getters:\nSloppy mode allows to extend a non-extensible object:\nAlso, sloppy mode allows to set properties on primitive values, without failing, but also without doing nothing at all:\nStrict mode fails in all those cases:\nIn sloppy mode, if you try to delete a property that you cannot delete, JavaScript simply returns false, while in Strict Mode, it raises a TypeError:\nIn normal functions, you can have duplicate parameter names:\nNote that arrow functions always raise a SyntaxError in this case:\nOctal syntax in Strict Mode is disabled. By default, prepending a 0 to a number compatible with the octal numeric format makes it (sometimes confusingly) interpreted as an octal number:\nYou can still enable octal numbers in Strict Mode using the 0oXX syntax:\nStrict Mode disables the with keyword, to remove some edge cases and allow more optimization at the compiler level.\nAn Immediately-invoked Function Expression is a way to execute functions immediately, as soon as they are created.\nIIFEs are very useful because they don\u2019t pollute the global object, and they are a simple way to isolate variables declarations.\nThis is the syntax that defines an IIFE:\nIIFEs can be defined with arrow functions as well:\nWe basically have a function defined inside parentheses, and then we append () to execute that function: (/* function */)().\nThose wrapping parentheses are actually what make our function, internally, be considered an expression. Otherwise, the function declaration would be invalid, because we didn\u2019t specify any name:\nFunction declarations want a name, while function expressions do not require it.\nYou could also put the invoking parentheses inside the expression parentheses, there is no difference, just a styling preference:\nThere is some weirder syntax that you can use to create an IIFE, but it\u2019s very rarely used in the real world, and it relies on using any unary operator:\n(does not work with arrow functions)\nAn IIFE can also be named regular functions (not arrow functions). This does not change the fact that the function does not \u201cleak\u201d to the global scope, and it cannot be invoked again after its execution:\nYou might see this in the wild:\nThis prevents issues when blindly concatenating two JavaScript files. Since JavaScript does not require semicolons, you might concatenate with a file with some statements in its last line that causes a syntax error.\nThis problem is essentially solved with \u201csmart\u201d code bundlers like webpack.\nPerforming math operations and calculus is a very common thing to do with any programming language. JavaScript offers several operators to help us work with numbers.\nAddition (+)\nThe + operator also serves as string concatenation if you use strings, so pay attention:\nSubtraction (-)\nDivision (/)\nReturns the quotient of the first operator and the second:\nIf you divide by zero, JavaScript does not raise any error but returns the Infinity value (or -Infinity if the value is negative).\nRemainder (%)\nThe remainder is a very useful calculation in many use cases:\nA reminder by zero is always NaN, a special value that means \"Not a Number\":\nMultiplication (*)\nExponentiation (**)\nRaise the first operand to the power second operand\nIncrement (++)\nIncrement a number. This is a unary operator, and if put before the number, it returns the value incremented.\nIf put after the number, it returns the original value, then increments it.\nDecrement ( \u2014 )\nWorks like the increment operator, except it decrements the value.\nUnary negation (-)\nReturn the negation of the operand\nUnary plus (+)\nIf the operand is not a number, it tries to convert it. Otherwise if the operand is already a number, it does nothing.\nThe regular assignment operator, =, has several shortcuts for all the arithmetic operators which let you combine assignment, assigning to the first operand the result of the operations with the second operand.\nThey are:\nExamples:\nEvery complex statement will introduce precedence problems.\nTake this:\nThe result is 2.5, but why? What operations are executed first, and which need to wait?\nSome operations have more precedence than the others. The precedence rules are listed as follows:\nOperations on the same level (like + and -) are executed in the order they are found\nFollowing the order above, we can solve this calculation:\nThe Math object contains lots of utilities math-related. Let\u2019s have a look at them all here.\nAll those functions are static. Math cannot be instantiated.\nReturns the absolute value of a number\nReturns the arccosine of the operand\nThe operand must be between -1 and 1\nReturns the arcsine of the operand\nThe operand must be between -1 and 1\nReturns the arctangent of the operand\nReturns the arctangent of the quotient of its arguments.\nRounds a number up\nReturn the cosine of an angle expressed in radiants\nReturn the value of Math.E multiplied per the exponent that\u2019s passed as argument\nRounds a number down\nReturn the base e (natural) logarithm of a number\nReturn the highest number in the set of numbers passed\nReturn the smallest number in the set of numbers passed\nReturn the first argument raised to the second argument\nReturns a pseudorandom number between 0.0 and 1.0\nRounds a number to the nearest integer\nCalculates the sin of an angle expressed in radiants\nReturn the square root of the argument\nCalculates the tangent of an angle expressed in radiants\nES Modules is the ECMAScript standard for working with modules. While Node.js has been using the CommonJS standard for a long time, the browser never had a module system. Every major decision such as a module system must be first standardized by ECMAScript and then implemented by the browser.\nThis standardization process completed with ES6 and browsers started implementing this standard trying to keep everything well aligned, working all in the same way, and now ES Modules are supported in Chrome, Safari, Edge and Firefox (since version 60).\nModules are very cool, because they let you encapsulate all sorts of functionality, and expose this functionality to other JavaScript files as libraries.\nThe syntax to import a module is:\nwhile CommonJS uses\nA module is a JavaScript file that exports one or more value (objects, functions or variables), using the export keyword. For example, this module exports a function that returns a string uppercase:\nIn this example, the module defines a single, default export, so it can be an anonymous function. Otherwise it would need a name to distinguish it from other exports.\nNow, any other JavaScript module can import the functionality offered by uppercase.js by importing it.\nAn HTML page can add a module by using a <script> tag with the special type=\"module\" attribute:\nIt\u2019s important to note that any script loaded with type=\"module\" is loaded in strict mode.\nIn this example, the uppercase.js module defines a default export, so when we import it, we can assign it a name we prefer:\nand we can use it:\nYou can also use an absolute path for the module import, to reference modules defined on another domain:\nThis is also valid import syntax:\nThis is not:\nIt\u2019s either absolute, or has a ./ or / before the name.\nWe saw this example above:\nThis creates one default export. In a file however you can export more than one thing, by using this syntax:\nAnother module can import all those exports using\nYou can import just a few of those exports, using the destructuring assignment:\nYou can rename any import, for convenience, using as:\nYou can import the default export, and any non-default export by name, like in this common React import:\nYou can check an ES Modules example on https://glitch.com/edit/#!/flavio-es-modules-example?path=index.html\nModules are fetched using CORS. This means that if you reference scripts from other domains, they must have a valid CORS header that allows cross-site loading (like Access-Control-Allow-Origin: *)\nUse a combination of type=\"module\" and nomodule:\nES Modules are one of the biggest features introduced in modern browsers. They are part of ES6 but the road to implement them has been long.\nWe can now use them! But we must also remember that having more than a few modules is going to have a performance hit on our pages, as it\u2019s one more step that the browser must perform at runtime.\nWebpack is probably going to still be a huge player even if ES Modules land in the browser, but having such a feature directly built in the language is huge for a unification of how modules work in the client-side and on Node.js as well.\nThe CommonJS module specification is the standard used in Node.js for working with modules.\nThey let you create clearly separate and reusable snippets of functionality, each testable on its own.\nThe huge npm ecosystem is built upon this CommonJS format.\nThe syntax to import a module is:\nIn CommonJS, modules are loaded synchronously, and processed in the order the JavaScript runtime finds them. This system was born with server-side JavaScript in mind, and is not suitable for the client-side (this is why ES Modules were introduced).\nA JavaScript file is a module when it exports one or more of the symbols it defines, being them variables, functions, objects:\nAny JavaScript file can import and use this module:\nA simple example can be found in this Glitch.\nYou can export more than one value:\nand import them individually using the destructuring assignment:\nor just export one value using:\nand import it using\nTo end with, a guide to a few terms used in frontend development that might be alien to you\nCode is asynchronous when you initiate something, forget about it, and when the result is ready you get it back without having to wait for it. The typical example is an AJAX call, which might take even seconds and in the meantime you complete other stuff, and when the response is ready, the callback function gets called. Promises and async/await are the modern way to handle async.\nIn JavaScript a block is delimited curly braces ({}). An if statement contains a block, a for loop contains a block.\nWith Function Scoping, any variable defined in a block is visible and accessible from inside the whole block, but not outside of it.\nA callback is a function that\u2019s invoked when something happens. A click event associated to an element has a callback function that\u2019s invoked when the user clicks the element. A fetch request has a callback that\u2019s called when the resource is downloaded.\nA declarative approach is when you tell the machine what you need to do, and you let it figure out the details. React is considered declarative, as you reason about abstractions rather than editing the DOM directly. Every high level programming language is more declarative than a low level programming language like Assembler. JavaScript is more declarative than C. HTML is declarative.\nA fallback is used to provide a good experience when a user hasn\u2019t access to a particular functionality. For example a user that browses with JavaScript disabled should be able to have a fallback to a plain HTML version of the page. Or for a browser that has not implemented an API, you should have a fallback to avoid completely breaking the experience of the user.\nWith Function Scoping, any variable defined in a function is visible and accessible from inside the whole function.\nA variable is immutable when its value cannot change after it\u2019s created. A mutable variable can be changed. The same applies to objects and arrays.\nLexical Scoping is a particular kind of scoping where variables of a parent function are made available to inner functions as well. The scope of an inner function also includes the scope of a parent function.\nA polyfill is a way to provide new functionality available in modern JavaScript or a modern browser API to older browsers. A polyfill is a particular kind of shim.\nA function that has no side effects (does not modify external resources), and its output is only determined by the arguments. You could call this function 1M times, and given the same set of arguments, the output will always be the same.\nJavaScript with var and let declaration allows you to reassign a variable indefinitely. With constdeclarations you effectively declare an immutable value for strings, integers, booleans, and an object that cannot be reassigned (but you can still modify it through its methods).\nScope is the set of variables that\u2019s visible to a part of the program.\nScoping is the set of rules that\u2019s defined in a programming language to determine the value of a variable.\nA shim is a little wrapper around a functionality, or API. It\u2019s generally used to abstract something, pre-fill parameters or add a polyfill for browsers that do not support some functionality. You can consider it like a compatibility layer.\nA side effect is when a function interacts with some other function or object outside it. Interaction with the network or the file system, or with the UI, are all side effects.\nState usually comes into play when talking about Components. A component can be stateful if it manages its own data, or stateless if it doesn\u2019t.\nA stateful component, function or class manages its own state (data). It could store an array, a counter or anything else.\nA stateless component, function or class is also called dumb because it\u2019s incapable of having its own data to make decisions, so its output or presentation is entirely based on its arguments. This implies that pure functions are stateless.\nStrict mode is an ECMAScript 5.1 new feature, which causes the JavaScript runtime to catch more errors, but it helps you improve the JavaScript code by denying undeclared variables and other things that might cause overlooked issues like duplicated object properties and other subtle things. Hint: use it. The alternative is \u201csloppy mode\u201d which is not a good thing even looking at the name we gave it.\nTree shaking means removing \u201cdead code\u201d from the bundle you ship to your users. If you add some code that you never use in your import statements, that\u2019s not going to be sent to the users of your app, to reduce file size and loading time.\nThanks for reading!\nNote: You can get a PDF, ePub, or Mobi version of this JavaScript Handbook for easier reference, or for reading on your Kindle or tablet.\n", "link": "https://medium.freecodecamp.org/the-complete-javascript-handbook-f26b2c71719c", "author": "Flavio Copes", "comments": ["This is the motherload of references for Javascript concepts that I don\u2019t know about yet.

Society and technology have changed. Forcibly, our approach to reading has taken on new forms to accommodate a different way of life.\nThe question is: For better or worse?\nAlthough books give us new ideas, spark discussions, and explore topics in detail, the same information can be delivered in a variety of formats. When it comes to exactly how we should absorbing books, the debate rages on.\nLet\u2019s take a look.\nSince the 1950s, speed reading has been touted as an effective way to get through reading material quickly. Scientists, psychologists, and teachers have come up with methods to increase reading speed, whether through manual tools or visual movements.\nAt the World Championship Speed Reading Competition, top contestants can reach 1,000 to 2,000 words per minute. Six-time champion Anne Jones reached 4,200 words per minute at one point.\nThose rates seem phenomenal compared to the average adult\u2019s 300 words per minute. So then, what types of strategies are speed readers using?\nHere are four common methods:\n1. Skimming involves quickly going through passages to find the main points. Instead of combing each word carefully, you go over first and last paragraphs, headings, and similar cues to find key ideas. Scanning, a similar method, involves running your eyes down the text to find certain words and phrases.\n2. Meta guiding uses a pointer, such as your index finger or a pen, to guide your eyes along the lines of text. A pointer helps your eyes move horizontally, focusing on the word that you should be reading.\n3. Vision span method uses the span of human eyesight to read words in batches. Readers focus their eyesight on one central word, and then use their peripheral vision to see adjacent words. By relying on our peripherals, it\u2019s believed that we can read about five words at once.\n4. Rapid serial visual representation (RSVP) is a more recent technique where an electronic reading system displays words one at a time. You can choose the speed at which the words show up on the screen.\nWhile many readers stand by these methods, they\u2019re not without controversies. Skimming means that you lose out on the details of a piece. On the other hand, preliminary skimming and scanning can help you to quickly hone in on certain topics, and then read those passages in greater detail.\nIn the comprehensive book Psychology of Reading, Keith Rayner dismisses speed reading techniques. He explains that we\u2019re constrained by the anatomy of our eyes and the ability of our brains to process information. While some techniques aim to eliminate the process of sounding words in our head to save time (otherwise known as subvocalization), Rayner states that our memory and comprehension levels decrease dramatically.\nAs for the top speed reading contestants at the world championships, their comprehension rates tend to hover around 50 percent. While Anne Jones\u2019s 4,200 words per minute rate is impressive, her comprehension was at 67 percent, and she had been exposed to the material before.\nRegardless of which reading method you use, the evidence points towards the fact that speed comes at the sacrifice of understanding.\nDepending on what you\u2019re reading, this might not necessarily be a bad thing. If you\u2019re trying to get through a dry piece to capture a few key points, skimming makes sense. The RSVP method can work if you\u2019re going through a short piece that\u2019s easy to understand. Personally, I like using a pen to guide my eyes along the text.\nBut if you\u2019re going through a difficult book or one that you want to savor and reflect on, it probably doesn\u2019t make sense to use methods that involve skipping or plowing through the material as fast as possible.\nA long time ago, there was only one option available: the traditional paper book. Nowadays, we can choose to read, watch, or listen to books. While there\u2019s the luxury of options, new questions arise, such as: How should we read a book? Is one format superior to the other?\nWe\u2019ll look first at traditional books, then e-books, and finally, audiobooks.\nAccording to research, paper books have certain advantages over other formats. For one, readers have a better sense of progression when they can physically flip through pages. This progression also contributes to greater memory retention. Also, paper books act as effective sleeping aids, since they don\u2019t emit the blue light that electronic devices do.\nThe other advantage to traditional books is a more personal preference. Some people like the feeling of paper. The pulpy smell, the weighty feeling, and the ability to flip through the pages enhance the reading experience. The drawback behind paper books, though, is that they\u2019re often heavier and more inconvenient to carry around than other types of reading formats.\nThe greatest advantage e-books offer is convenience. Whether you carry one book or a hundred makes no difference in weight. This is useful for traveling, especially if you want more reading options. E-books also provide a sense familiarity, as we become accustomed to electronic devices such as smartphones and tablets.\nThe big issue around e-readers, however, is the blue light effect. In one study, researchers found that people who read light emitting e-readers took longer to fall asleep than those who read paper books. Readers who used devices such as tablets, laptops, smartphones, and backlit readers reduced their levels of melatonin, a hormone that increases in the evenings and induces sleepiness. As a result, they experienced low-quality sleep and were tired the next morning.\nThe good news is that e-ink readers, such as the Kindle, are an exception. These devices emit light towards the screen to cast a glow, rather than directly shining a light towards the reader\u2019s eyes. The resulting effect is similar to a lamp shining onto a paper book.\nThere is some skepticism behind audio, as some people feel that it doesn\u2019t provide the same level of immersion as reading. A study notes that you can absorb information almost as well through audio as reading (whether they\u2019re fully equal is another topic of debate). In some cases, the narrator\u2019s tone can even help listeners to better understand the meaning behind texts.\nThe issue with audio, though, is that humans are prone to multi-tasking. If you\u2019re typing up an email or cooking a meal while listening to the narrator, the message can become lost. Personally, I like using audiobooks when I\u2019m less likely to be distracted, such as when waiting around or going for a walk.\nLately, speeding through audiobooks has become popular. Some people zip through a book at 2x, or sometimes even 3x the regular speed. While they claim that no information is lost, should we be approaching material this way?\nA book is not simply an open box waiting to be checked off. Going through a book is an experience \u2014 one that requires absorbing the material, reflecting on it, and coming out having learned something new. Similar to how creative moments happen during quiet periods, our insights from books happen during periodic pauses.\nGiven the boom in e-readers, smartphones, and electronic devices in general, it shouldn\u2019t be a surprise that people are resorting to reading in different ways. As information goes digital, books have become easier to access.\nHowever, over things can be accessed easily as well. Videos are available on-demand. People can chat with friends across the world. Considering the countless options available at our fingertips, are books really more enticing than before?\nAccording to one survey in Japan, the longer people spent on their smartphones, the less time they spent reading books. Overall, 53 percent of respondents did not read a single book in the last month, consistent with rates in the previous five years.\nOn a positive note, research has found an increase in reading from 17 to 21 percent after a holiday season where tablets and e-readers were popular gift choices. Around 43 percent of American adults have consumed long-form content in the past year, whether it\u2019s books, journals, or articles. The average e-reader, specifically, has read 24 books in the past 12 months, while a non-e-book reader has read 15 books.\nThe places where people read books have changed as well. People are squeezing in bits of reading whenever they have a moment to spare, such as on the daily commute or in between tasks. Increasingly, people are reading while watching television or surfing the computer.\nAlthough people are increasingly reading in short spurts, the benefits from \u201cdeep reading\u201d are lost in the process. Reading in long periods helps the reader to enter a state similar to a hypnotic trance, in which the experience is most enjoyable.\nInterestingly, the reading rate actually slows down. In this state, the reader quickly decodes words while keeping a gradual pace, heightening the understanding and relationship between author and reader.\nIdeally, we would be able to read uninterrupted for hours at a time, under soft lighting, and free of all distractions. Unfortunately, most of us don\u2019t have that luxury on a daily basis.\nSo how can we make the most out of what we read? Here are four solutions:\nReading only when you have long, empty periods to spare can be difficult. We squeeze in books whenever we can, between work and relaxation. These factors make it hard to fully immerse ourselves.\nIt makes sense, then, to categorize reading material according to your place and time. For instance, articles and light reads can be reserved for short periods. Books that require less focus can be listened to in audio format. Heavy reading material can be saved for those moments when you have long stretches of free time.\nSince I started making reading books a daily habit, I\u2019ve been able to:\nOptimal reading times include early in the morning, or right before sleep. Of course, you can fit in reading whenever, but I find these two times perfect for starting and ending the day.\nAn easy way to begin this habit is by putting a book on your bedside table so that it\u2019s one of the first things you see after waking up and before going to sleep. If you\u2019re rusty on the reading, choosing a light, fun read can is an effective way to ease yourself into picking up a book.\nAfter watching the latest episode of your favorite show, have you felt the need to share your thoughts and opinions with fellow watchers? If so, why should books be any different?\nIf you just finished reading a book you enjoyed, share it with someone who might like it as well (here\u2019s a list of books I like). And if someone with similar tastes recommends a book to you, why not check it out?\nGoing through similar experiences and bonding through books helps you become closer with others, creating a similar feeling to traveling together or watching the same film. A shared discussion can also help you to better understand and appreciate what you read.\nAs I mentioned earlier, I don\u2019t like to simply zip through a book, check it off, and move onto the next one. When I do that, I find that I lose out on the implications behind the work. Instead, I use a few methods to absorb the material, including:\nAlthough some still resort to old-fashioned paper books, the traditional format is making way for a different style of reading. We\u2019re carrying hundreds of books electronically. We\u2019re listening to stories. We\u2019re watching events unfold on screen.\nNot only is the form changing, but so is our approach.\nWe\u2019re increasingly cutting our activities into small segments, rushing to finish what we do, or trying to do everything at once. While it\u2019s almost impossible to push back against the tides of time, it\u2019s up to us to find methods to adapt and thrive in periods of change, both in reading and other facets of life.\nWant to learn how to do what you love?

This is what went through J. Richard Gott\u2019s head when he visited Germany in 1969.\nIf you think about it, this is a tough question, as there is not much data available about lifetimes of walls in Germany (in fact, the Berlin Wall is a single datapoint). How then to approach a question like that, where we are almost completely in the dark?\nGott, today a professor in Astrophysics at Princeton University, thought about it like this: there was nothing special about him seeing the Wall on that particular day in that particular year. If you divide the Wall\u2019s entire lifetime into four equal-length segments, then there is a 50% probability that he would have arrived within the middle two segments. This in turn translates into an estimate for how much longer the Wall should remain: between a third of its lifetime so far (if he happened to visit at end of the two middle segments), and three times its lifetime so far (if he happened to visit at the beginning of the two middle segments).\nGiven that the Wall at the time was 8 years old in 1969, he concluded that with 50% confidence it would last another 3 to 24 years. The Wall lasted another 20 years.\nGott\u2019s reasoning that he did not visit the Wall at any special moment in time is really an application of the much broader Copernican principle, which states that we occupy neither a special place, nor exist in a special time in the Universe\u2019s history. Earth is not a special place, and neither is our Solar System or Milky Way Galaxy. 2019 is not a special time to be alive.\nGott\u2019s calculation based on the Copernican principle can help us arrive at least at an estimate of the timing of an event when we are otherwise completely in the dark. It can be a fun exercise to estimate various world events with it:\nTo be fair, Gott was not the first to apply this line of reasoning to make predictions based on limited data. Consider the German Tank Problem: during World War II, the Allies tried to estimate the total number of German tanks based on the serial numbers of tanks captured so far. In the extreme case, a single captured tank could at least give a clue about how many tanks there are in total. If its serial number is 60, say, then there is a 50% chance that the total number of tanks is between 80 and 240. In practice, the estimate gets better with more tanks captured.\nGott\u2019s calculation based on the Copernican principle is really a consequence of applying Bayes\u2019 law, which more broadly tells us how to update our probability estimates in the face of new information. Gott showed how to update our estimates based on a single datapoint. In most cases however, we have additional information about expected outcomes of phenomena simply from our life experiences, and that extra information makes our predictions more accurate.\nThere are broadly two different types of observations in our world: things that cluster around a natural value, and things that do not. We call the former Gaussian distributions, and the latter power-law distributions. Human life spans are an examples for Gaussian distributions, and so are human weight, calorie intake, hours of sleep per night, the lengths of movies, the tail lengths of a mice, and so on.\nTake humans life spans, for example. We have good expectations of life spans: in the United States, for instance, the average life span is around 78 years, and the distribution is roughly Gaussian. In Statistics terms, this extra information is our prior.\nBecause of our prior, we can update the probability of someone\u2019s remaining lifespan based on how old they are more accurately than with the Copernican principle \u2014 we have extra information. The Social Security Administration, for instance, is updating this calculation each year, and so do insurance companies: according to their tables, the expected remaining life span of a 7-year old is around 70 years, while the expected remaining life span of a 70-year old is around 14 years. This is a fundamental consequence of having a Gaussian prior: the longer you live, the shorter you expect your additional life span to be.\nNot everything in our world follows a Gaussian distribution. When observations vary over many orders of magnitude, we are likely dealing with a power-law distribution \u2014 examples are populations of cities, book sales, movie grosses, people\u2019s wealths and incomes.\nTake movie grosses for example. The most successful movie of 2018, Black Panther, made around 700 Million dollars, while Billionaire Boys Club, one of the worst performers, made a meager $600 \u2014 this is a difference of 6 orders of magnitude! Another way to say this is that power-law distributions have no natural scale: they are scale-free distributions. Movies can make hundreds or hundreds of Millions of dollars.\nUsing Bayes\u2019 law, we can again estimate where we expect an observation to end up, given where we see it today, and given the power-law prior. As it turns out, a power-law prior implies a multiplicative prediction rule: multiply the quantity observed so far by a constant factor, and this is the expected end result. For movie grosses, for instance, that multiple is around 1.4: given that a movie already made $10 Million, it is likely that it will top out at $14 Million (For Billionaire Boys Club, the outlook is pretty grim). The multiplicative rule is a direct consequence of the scale-free nature of power-laws, where the only thing that gives us a sense of the scale is the single observation we have.\nGott\u2019s Berlin Wall prediction \u2014 it will stand between a third and 3 times as long as it already stood \u2014 is thus similar to a Bayesian prediction with a power-law prior, with the difference that the multiplicative factor is not known. Gott\u2019s Berlin Wall calculation is more ignorant, given the lack of data.\nThus, the most important difference between Gaussian and power-law priors is this: With a Gaussian prior, the longer something has been going on, the shorter we expect it to continue. With a power-law prior, the longer something has been going on, the longer we expect it to keep going.\nWhether we acknowledge them or not, we implicitly learn priors for various phenomena in our world over the course of our lifetimes, simply based on the observations we make every day in the world. We learn that peoples\u2019 heights, weights, and life spans cluster around a typical value, while city populations, movie grosses, and wealth does not. We are ultimately Bayesian thinkers.\nTake call center hold times as an example: Researchers Tom Griffith and Josh Tenenbaum surveyed what people think their total hold time would be, based on the time already waited. By fitting their answers to different distributions, they learned that people, on average, have power-law expectations of hold times, with a multiplication parameter of around 1.3: after holding for 5 minutes, they expect to be waiting a total of 7 minutes. After holding for 50 minutes, they expect to be waiting a total of 67 minutes.\nIn Algorithms to Live By, authors Brian Christian and Tom Griffith tell the tragic story of Harvard biologist Stephen Jay Gould, who was diagnosed with a deadly form of cancer in 1982. By reading the medical literature, Gould learned that his median life expectancy at this stage was a mere 8 months.\nHowever, he reasoned, that statistic was not telling anything about the distribution of the life expectancies. If it were Gaussian, then his life expectancy would be more or less 8 month, and the closer he gets to that point, the shorter it would be.\nIf it were a power-law on the other hand, the longer he would survive, the longer he could expect to survive! Gould discovered that the distribution was in fact strongly skewed (more like a power-law), and went on to live for another 20 years after his diagnosis.\nPriors matter: the better our priors, the better our predictions.\n", "link": "https://towardsdatascience.com/how-to-be-less-wrong-5d6632a08f", "author": "Samuel Flender", "comments": [], "claps": "28 claps"}, {"num_comments": 15, "title": "Think Like a Roman Emperor \u2013 Personal Growth \u2013 Medium", "tags": ["philosophy", "psychology", "history", "life lessons", "self improvement"], "reading_time": 8, "text": "Marcus Aurelius is perhaps the best known Roman Emperor for the right reasons. Most of us know the names of Nero and Caligula for their despotism and destructive indulgences, but Marcus comes close to universal praise for the way he wielded power over the greatest empire the world has known.\nHe is known principally for his journals, compiled into a book known as the Meditations. The journals documented the common and sometimes surprising struggles that come with absolute power and Marcus\u2019s philosophical thoughts as a practicing Stoic.\nAlong with Nerva, Trajan, Hadrian and Antonius Pious, Marcus is known as one of the five \u201cgood emperors\u201d, first coined by Niccolo\u0300 Machiavelli. The Italian statesman and political philosopher pointed out the curious fact that all the best emperors of Rome were adopted and not raised as biological heirs.\nThe good emperors, Machiavelli wrote,\nCuriously still, all the \u201cgood\u201d emperors reigned in succession from 96\u2013192 CE. Edward Gibbon, the great historian of Rome\u2019s decline, believed that the era of the \u201cfive good emperors\u201d was the most \u201chappy and prosperous\u201d for mankind. The reasons being that rule is best when it is absolute and reasonable:\nDespite having the honour of being Rome\u2019s last good emperor, Marcus was unhappy when he was made a \u201cCaesar\u201d, given the role as heir to (and adopted by) Antonius Pius.\nMany would find the idea of this absurd \u2014 why would anybody turn down the inheritance of absolute power and riches beyond your wildest dreams?\nBut being emperor, a position that was impossible to abdicate from \u2014 was a double-edged sword.\nThe average time in power of Roman emperors was short thanks to murderous usurpers. Some Emperors lasted mere months in the hot seat before being dispatched by a conspiracy.\nIt was not just the fear of his own life that could have made Marcus reluctant. The young man was already a keen Stoic. Power and riches were potentially an obstacle to Stoic virtue.\nBut how Marcus coped with his role is the reason he thrived in it, and why to this day people seek comfort in his writings.\nA new book by Donald Robertson, How to Think Like a Roman Emperor, throws light on how the ideas in Marcus Aurelius\u2019s Meditations acted as psychological strategies to help the sage-emperor cope and thrive in the role that was bestowed upon him.\nRobertson is a cognitive-behavioral psychotherapist and draws parallels between therapy techniques and Stoic wisdom.\nNot all the parallels the author draws are new, but Robertson does add a great deal of depth through biographical details and drawing on his own psycho-therapeutic expertise. The picture he paints is of a vulnerable man, not a philosophical saint, and nor particularly a hero.\nCognitive behavioural therapy has roots in Stoicism. One of its first practitioners, Albert Ellis, took inspiration from the Greek philosopher Epictetus.\nBehavioural therapy challenges debilitating cognitive distortions, and this is essentially the approach Epictetus took to finding \u201ca tranquil flow of life.\u201d\nThe philosopher did not write (as far as we know), and his teachings were recorded for posterity by a promising student, Arrian of Nicomedia.\nEpictetus\u2019s ideas stem from the central Stoic notion that while you are not able to control your circumstances, you can control your emotional response to our circumstances.\nThe Stoics demonstrate that while we try to control external events but lose control of our thoughts and emotions, we have little to no control of the former and full control over the latter.\nEpictetus, for example, teaches us that it is our thoughts that cause injury to us, not the behaviour of other people:\nArrian of Nicomedia went on to a high-office political career and was close to the emperor Hadrian, Marcus\u2019s adoptive grandfather. He may well have met the child Marcus. Students like Arrian disseminated Epictetus\u2019s teachings throughout the Roman world. The sage had a considerable influence over Roman philosophy despite being born a slave.\nSo it\u2019s no surprise that Marcus learned a great deal from the teachings of Epictetus. Marcus\u2019s Meditations quote Epictetus extensively, the Emperor found a great deal of solace in the older philosopher\u2019s words. Echoing Epictetus, he wrote:\nRobertson demonstrates how Epictetus\u2019s methods could be considered pre-modern therapeutic techniques.\nBy revealing the links between the historical Stoics and the science behind their methods to attain tranquillity, Robertson\u2019s book shows Roman Stoicism to be more akin to a methodology than a dogma.\nStoicism helped Marcus Aurelius cope with fear, anger, and grief. This is not a result of \u201cknowing\u201d facts, but actually changing the way he thought. It\u2019s not about what you know, but how you think. Stoic philosophy orientates the mind to tranquillity.\nPerhaps the most extraordinary aspect of Marcus\u2019s philosophical development is that which came most natural to him.\nHadrian nicknamed the young Marcus \u201cVerissimus\u201d, meaning \u201cmost truthful\u201d, a sign of his affection for the child\u2019s plain-speaking. This made Marcus predisposed to Stoicism, since the Stoics saw simple language as virtuous.\nPlain speaking brings two profound changes to your thinking. Firstly, clear, unadorned language leads to a better, clearer idea of the truth. Secondly, it removes value judgments that may stoke emotions.\nHadrian was a cultured emperor and many philosophers were included in his court. Sophistry and rhetoric was an important part of court life and debates were staged to entertain Hadrian and his entourage.\nSophists were teachers in the Greek tradition who bestowed excellence on their students. Fine rhetoric \u2014 the art of emotive and clever speech taught by Sophists \u2014 was highly regarded by Hadrian.\nMarcus was taught by two of the most eminent Sophists in history: Fronto and Herodes Atticus. But it was a Stoic, Junius Rusticus, who most influenced the imperial heir\u2019s thinking and behaviour.\nMarcus adored the older philosopher and copied his mannerisms, such as wearing ordinary clothes and speaking plainly, without the adornment that Sophists prized.\nThis would have astonished courtiers at the time, an heir to the throne would be expected to speak like a Sophist and dress elaborately in the finest materials and dyes. Sophistry is, after all, where we get the word \u201csophistication\u201d from. Emperors are supposed to be so.\nSimplicity of language leads to clarity of thinking. When we use value judgments in our language, we start to behave irrationally and deceive ourselves as to the true nature of the world. Nothing is intrinsically good or bad, only our opinion makes it so.\nRobertson links the Stoic virtues of speech to the therapeutic process of \u201cde-catastrophisation\u201d, whereby patients go through a process of clarifying thoughts and disposing of excessive and emotive value judgments.\nIt only takes a short scan of the media or social media to see that catastrophising has become a common phenomenon in the public sphere. Think of Obama, Trump and Brexit: we\u2019ve seen these excessively damned and excessively praised in equal measure.\nIn a recent article, an artist is quoted as saying, \u201cPeople are becoming more and more stupid, insanely stupid.\u201d This was the headline of the piece. Damning unspecified swathes or even all \u201cpeople\u201d, is sadly becoming a regular occurrence in both the media and social media. Excessive pessimism and catastrophisation are becoming a problem for our culture.\nMarcus wrote:\nThe Stoics understood that colourful metaphors, over-generalisations and hyperbole are as damaging to ourselves as they are to other people. Our own language colours our thoughts and mind.\nSometimes democratic elections don\u2019t go our way. We can try to understand why the election didn\u2019t go our way and do something about it, or we can gripe and wail that the world is going to hell and that anybody who disagrees with us is \u201cstupid\u201d. What\u2019s the constructive thing to do for others and for ourselves?\nNow imagine being Marcus Aurelius: you are co-Emperor with Lucius Verus, an irresponsible drunkard, you have Parthians and Sarmatians in the east and Germanic tribes in the north rampaging the borderlands of the empire. You are supreme commander on the frontline and leader of an empire. Everybody around you looks to you for your leadership, those that don\u2019t want to take your place (one of Marcus\u2019s generals attempted to seize power from him).\nHow would you want to approach such a high-pressure situation that you never desired in the first place? With a clear head, or a head filled with emotional clutter?\nMarcus controlled his words and his words clarified his mind. Robertson demonstrates that this is akin to \u201ccognitive distancing\u201d a technique of cooly analysing the situation you are in.\nThe Emperor\u2019s clarity of thought allowed him to break problems or cravings down into their constituent parts and analysing them in isolation.\nWhen you describe alluring food, for example, in down-to-earth language, piece by piece, it suddenly becomes less alluring, you are \u201cdetached\u201d from it, your cravings dissipate.\nThis is just one method among the many needed to reach the Stoic goal of \u201capatheia\u201d: a tranquil indifference to the passions. Apatheia is essential for true wisdom, and the true good that all people should aspire to \u2014 the purpose of life, if you like \u2014 according to Marcus and the Stoics, is wisdom.\nWisdom is at the heart of mankind\u2019s nature (we are the one rational species), so to be wise is to be closer to nature. The Stoics understood God and nature to be the same thing \u2014 the totality of the universe, of which we are but a fragment. This is known as pantheism (\u201call is God\u201d).\nThe spiral of desires and value judgements are obstacles to wisdom, and therefore, Marcus believed, to God.\nThank you for reading, I hope you learned something new.\nIf you found this article interesting, you may enjoy my more in-depth article on Marcus Aurelius and Stoicism:\n", "link": "https://medium.com/personal-growth/think-like-a-roman-emperor-69ac71284d54", "author": "Steven Gambardella", "comments": ["Even individuals from 2000 years ago knew that bad thoughts led to bad outcomes.

The response has been overall positive and I\u2019d like to personally thank everyone for that.\nI wanted to talk a bit about what I think still falls flat, where the interface doesn\u2019t serve our users well, and how we\u2019d like to move forward.\nI also would like to make a public call for input. You guys know how we roll: publicly, and with pizazz. So if you have ideas or features that you\u2019d like to see, now is the time to add a comment.\nThese are supported from the get-go and will allow projects that are already running to support the Marketplace, as well as helping to grow fresh, new standards like dGoods and Simple Assets.\nUsers can do more than just sell and buy assets. They can open their own store, rent out assets they don\u2019t really want to part with, re-sell other people\u2019s assets, and create auctions.\nWe know that for the most-part the users who come to the Marketplace will know ahead of time what they are looking for. It should be easy for them to search for it, buy (or bid! or rent!) it.\nWherever you are, it is clear what you should do. Buttons and actions are obvious and from initial user-testing the layout enables our users to find the thing they want to do.\nEach asset has a history, and we had a feeling that people would want to see it. Initial feedback says that we were spot on.\nStores are customizable in a fashion similar to Twitter and Facebook profiles. You have a header and a main image that you control, in addition to being able to manage your store\u2019s widgets and layout. We\u2019ll be rolling out color customization in a future release that will take it even further.\nFor new users that land on the Marketplace they are totally lost without some hand-holding. We need to do better in ramping these users up and getting them into our digital economy.\nI think that this means we need to have:\nWhile not yet implemented in the demo, the intent is to allow non-Scatter users to get quickly up and running without too much hassle through sign-up via social media accounts like Google, Facebook, and Twitter. The Marketplace would hold users funds in a custodial service until they are ready to upgrade (for free!) to a full EOS account that they would have complete control over.\nWe think this is critical because the process of setting up an EOS account today is fairly cumbersome. It is a big ask for someone who just wants to play a game or buy a piece of art through the Marketplace.\nIf we\u2019re talking about millions of assets, how users will dial in their search results needs some serious fine-tuning. We know that this is a big issue and are currently experimenting with different ways to filter and show large amounts of assets in a sensible fashion.\nPart of the tooling that we think store owners will need is some basic analytics with standard KPIs that define:\nThe truth is that the core of the Marketplace will be the store owners themselves and we need to serve them first and foremost so that they can effectively access the growing economy we are building. I\u2019m actively seeking input on this specific issue, so if there are specific types of data that you\u2019d like to see for your store, please let me know below.\nWhile I do think that the majority of our users will be searching for specific assets, we want to have a more robust exploration mechanism for Stores, collections, and assets. I\u2019m still unsure how I want to tackle this as it is not well scoped at this stage of the project. I know it is necessary, but the details are still fuzzy.\nSome criteria for a better exploration experience:\nRight now the site is very hierarchical. This is partly my fault as it is very much how my mind is organized.\nThe truth of the matter is that a good Marketplace should be more.. bushy. It should have short branches that you can easily jump between because if you find an asset that you\u2019re sort of interested in, it is likely that its cousin on a nearby branch will be exactly what you are looking for.\nA UX pattern that I think will help with this is not having single assets open on their own page, but in a modal with \u201csimilar\u201d navigation positioned in relation to the modal.\nOne of the places that I think we are weakest in our current iteration is how we handle repeat customers.\nWe are not exposing them to assets they have viewed previously, nor are we suggesting to them assets that are similar to those within the context of their return to the Marketplace (we do show similar assets in the single asset view). If we want to see the Marketplace succeed, I think it will be largely through improvements in these types of details.\nIf you\u2019d like to stay up to date and be the first to know, add yourself to our mailing list.\nSend us your NFT-centric projects to business@get-scatter.com and make sure that when we launch, you launch with us.\n\u2014 Rami James | Telegram: https://t.me/Scatter | Website: https://get-scatter.com\nScatter is a blockchain application signature provider.

The Seattle-based retail giant employs over 600,000 people and operates 100 sortation and fulfillment centers in North America, sometimes sending out as many as 1 million items per day. But Amazon does more than retail. Much more. Amazon publishes its own books and comics, finances TV shows and movies, operates a Texas wind farm, builds robots, streams music, delivers prescription meds, and operates web services for everyone from Medium to the CIA. And that\u2019s not even counting its high-profile acquisitions, which include Twitch, IMDB, Zappos.com, and Whole Foods.\nWhat\u2019s it like working from inside the beast? OneZero has been talking to workers at every level of the Amazon empire to find out. Welcome to The Amazon Diaries.\nIn September, Democratic presidential candidate and senator Elizabeth Warren criticized Amazon\u2019s position as both a marketplace and a retailer, which she said grants it a \u201cspecial information advantage\u201d that it could use to wipe out other businesses. The implication is that Amazon\u2019s access to vast amounts of sales data gives it a distinct (and unfair) edge over others \u2014 especially small and medium-sized retailers that are already struggling with Amazon\u2019s scale. In March, Warren promised to use antitrust laws to \u201cbreak up\u201d Amazon, along with other tech giants like Facebook and Google, if elected president. As the senator put it last year: \u201cYou got to pick one business or the other, baby.\u201d\nFew retailers feel the sheer might of Amazon\u2019s power like the estimated 2.5 million Amazon Marketplace sellers. These vendors do most of the actual fulfilling of the purchases on what is now the largest online retailer in the United States. According to one analysis, the $175 billion in sales on the Amazon Marketplace accounted for 68 percent of Amazon\u2019s total sales and 31.3 percent of e-commerce sales industry-wide in 2018. (Walmart and eBay also have third-party seller platforms.)\nAn extensive report from The Verge last year revealed the Marketplace to be a sort of capitalist fever dream: unceasing and treacherous competition between sellers, presided over by a seemingly arbitrary \u201cquasi-state,\u201d complete with its own bureaucracy and court system, all of which generated $19 billion in revenue for Amazon from seller commissions and fees in the first half of 2018.\nRecently, OneZero spoke with one of those sellers: a small retailer in the mid-Atlantic region who has been active on the Marketplace since 2010 and spoke on the condition of anonymity for fear of getting booted from the platform. As Amazon grew, Alex* grew increasingly dependent on Amazon: in 2010, when he started selling on the Marketplace, Amazon sales accounted for five percent of his revenue; today, Amazon sales account for between 40 and 50 percent. Alex described his situation as that of an \u201cindentured servant.\u201d\nUnlike some on the Marketplace, Alex is not a manufacturer, but a distributor; he sells automotive tools like drill bits, flashlights, and spark plugs. A former traveling salesman, he started his business before the recession \u2014 \u201cbefore the economy took a crap,\u201d as he put it \u2014 to get off the road. \u201cI used to sell on the street. I wanted to sell online so I didn\u2019t have to leave the house every day and drive everywhere,\u201d he said. \u201cIt was a good idea then, but unfortunately some good ideas only last a decade and not decades.\u201d\nNow, he\u2019s increasingly concerned about will happen if Amazon decides that they don\u2019t want to share revenue with smaller distributors like him anymore. \u201cIf they keep doing what they\u2019re doing, \u201d he says, \u201cthere\u2019s just gonna be manufacturers and Amazon and that\u2019s it.\u201d\nThe following interview has been edited and condensed for clarity.\nAlex: I get up and I\u2019m at the business by about 7 a.m every day, and then from 7 a.m. to about 8 a.m. I go through to see where the orders are, shoot emails. And then I also have to do paperwork, so I do a download on PayPal of all the orders that came in overnight because I sell on eBay, too. That usually takes a half hour to an hour. Once you\u2019re done with that, you start shipping and looking at orders. If you realize you\u2019re out of stuff, then you have to start placing orders. I buy from a distributor over in New Jersey for a bunch of stuff. He ships UPS same day and I\u2019ll get it the next day, because I\u2019m only one state over.\nAnd then you gotta also look on the websites. There\u2019s a lot of fake orders coming in using stolen cards, you have to know what to look for. The problem is if you ship an order purchased with a stolen credit card, eventually someone complains their card was stolen. And the credit card company takes the money right out of your bank account and gives it back to the person who had their card stolen and you\u2019re out the item and the money. Some do still get through but the majority of them I catch.\nOnce I do that, then I start looking at all the things that I ship through. I ship through Amazon, Walmart, eBay, and then I have two websites, so I ship to both of those too. Amazon is the largest, eBay is the second, websites are the third, and Walmart is \u2014 I don\u2019t even know why they\u2019re doing it. I don\u2019t know what they\u2019re selling, but it\u2019s not my stuff, let\u2019s put it that way.\nProbably 40 to 50 percent. In 2010, when I first started doing this with Amazon, I think they were maybe 5 percent of my sales. But Amazon\u2019s a juggernaut now. I mean, 50 percent of all dollars on the internet go through Amazon. [Editor: This is a slight exaggeration, but Amazon did account for nearly half of all e-commerce sales in the United States last year.] When I started doing eBay, back in 2009, it was 23 percent market share. I make good money on eBay but unfortunately people don\u2019t go there like they used to.\nExactly. I call them \u201cindentured servants,\u201d because that\u2019s what we are. I mean, you can\u2019t go back to another job working for someone else, because you make a decent living, but then you\u2019re resigned to working 10 to 12 hour days, six days a week. If you wanted to become a large company selling on Amazon, it\u2019s very difficult. It works for me, because it\u2019s just me and one other person, and I can micromanage things. But once you start getting too many people, they make mistakes. One mistake is enough to kill your career on Amazon.\nIn anything with Amazon, if you happen to be at the wrong place at the wrong time, or anger the wrong person in their corporation, they suspend you. Getting back on is near impossible. That\u2019s just how they are. I always tell people, \u201cI\u2019m not complaining about Amazon, that\u2019s just how they are. I understand how they are, they make me a living, but it\u2019s very hard to make a living and the margins suck.\u201d That\u2019s the best way to put it.\nAmazon has this thing that\u2019s called a \u201cphantom order.\u201d Basically, when you sell stuff, and you sell out, you\u2019ll keep the inventory \u201cout of stock,\u201d because you don\u2019t have any. Well, sometimes your item will phantomly come back up to be sold again. Then, the item sells, and you can\u2019t get the item because the manufacturer is out of stock so the customer can\u2019t have it for several weeks. Amazon says, \u201cWell, we don\u2019t know anything about this phantom order, but you gotta fill it.\u201d\nThen, you have to cancel the order, but, because it\u2019s Prime, the maximum amount of cancellations you can have in a month is half a percent. Now, I do a lot of business with Amazon. I probably do about a half million dollars a year, which is a lot for me. I do sell through other platforms too, but when you cancel one order out of 178 orders in a month, that one order almost puts you over that half percent.\nTo make Prime, you have to be 97 percent efficient, delivered on time. They do it on a weekly basis. Ninety seven percent \u2014 that\u2019s ungodly. You have to be Jesus to be able to achieve that. I mean, we had that weird freak snowstorm this week that was supposed to be nothing and then that made UPS and the Postal Service do a bad job. And then, of course, there was that cold weather, so I had three or four packages not delivered on time in one week. Now, I have the big red X that says, \u201cYou can be suspended if you keep this up.\u201d\nAs Amazon grew, I decided to make changes, too. I used to sell really well on there not doing Prime \u2014 I didn\u2019t want to do Prime because you have to get something there in two days, and it has to be free freight, which is costly on a lot of items. I didn\u2019t want to follow that model, but then the manufacturer went in and did Fulfillment by Amazon, which means they send the merchandise to Amazon and Amazon takes care of the orders and everything.\nI couldn\u2019t compete against that. I basically decided that I was selling against the manufacturer. I couldn\u2019t make any money on it anymore. I was forced to either do Fulfillment by Amazon or basically go with no sales. I decided to follow the manufacturer and do the fulfillment. Now, the problem with doing that is the margins suck, you don\u2019t really make any money. There\u2019s a lot of orders that go out and you\u2019re actually losing money on them.\nYou try to make it up with the ones you do make money on. It\u2019s not a good business model, I can tell you that! If you decide not to cover that area, then you just don\u2019t sell anything.\nWhen you do sell Prime, let\u2019s say you\u2019re willing to cover anywhere in the country for two-day air or two-day delivery. You pick the area. You could pick the whole Eastern Seaboard, anywhere that UPS says they do in two days, that kind of thing. That\u2019s what we did at the beginning and it worked rather well. In fact, at that time I was doing FedEx ground. But then Amazon changed their algorithm, which basically made it so if you didn\u2019t cover a large part of the country, they barely ever let you be found in Prime... Rest assured, if Amazon is selling the same thing as you, they don\u2019t go down, no matter what happens. They always get to keep their stuff up. The rules that I have to abide by, they don\u2019t have to.\nThey have a new policy that they\u2019re starting. Something called Vendor One. The manufacturer sells directly to Amazon, Amazon then sells it for whatever they want. Well, since they don\u2019t have to pay the 15 percent fee that I have to pay, naturally they can sell it for less, right? So you can\u2019t compete. They buy direct from the manufacturer, sell for whatever they like, and then they wipe out all the small businesses because we can\u2019t compete.\nI think the only way sellers can stop it is if they would band together and actually do their own website or stop selling on Amazon... The problem with that is that never works. You can never get everyone to band together to do this, you know what I mean? There\u2019s always someone who will say, \u201cI\u2019ll go do it, because I\u2019ll get all the orders.\u201d You can\u2019t get them to stick together.\nI don\u2019t have a solution for it, I really don\u2019t. To me, Amazon is a monopoly \u2014 there\u2019s just a reverse monopoly. A normal monopoly raises prices to an exorbitant amount of money, because they\u2019re the only person doing it. Television, the internet carriers, that kind of stuff. Well, Amazon is upside down: their version of the internet is to sell the stuff as cheap as possible to the cheapest person out there. That way they will always be overlooked by the regulators because they say, \u201cWell, they\u2019re a monopoly by definition, but they are giving consumers extreme value, so we\u2019re not gonna do anything about it.\u201d So, they get left alone.\n*The interview subject\u2019s name has been changed to protect his identity.\n", "link": "https://onezero.medium.com/amazon-marketplace-seller-one-mistake-is-enough-to-kill-your-career-85df2ee9045e", "author": "Brendan O'Connor", "comments": [], "claps": "2.3K claps"}, {"num_comments": 1, "title": "Magento \u2014 New Day \u2013 Karen Baker \u2013 Medium", "tags": ["magento", "ecommerce"], "reading_time": 3, "text": "Well its the end of an era. I\u2019ve known Mark Lavelle back from when he first walked into the PreImagine event at the Hard Rock cafe (I feel like it was 2014) and I said hallo then as I recall proceeded to ask him not to destroy the ecosystem. The Hard Rock conf was a turning point for Magento \u2014 they tried to go very eBay Enterprise at that conf and there was a big kick back from the ecosystem to say hey remember Magento.\nI remember though at the end of the conf I passed Mark in the corridor and he really could have just carried on walking, but he didn\u2019t, he came over to me and said something along the lines of \u2018look I\u2019m listening\u2019. Well that\u2019s really all you can ask for. I still thought he didn\u2019t have a clue about the ecosystem, but I did see a person of integrity standing there.\nFurther backed up then I believe by the research after the Magento split was that the USP of Magento was indeed its ecosystem. It is second to none in the platform space. Now many of us have spread our wings into other platforms and areas, yet we remain solid partners, with a respect and appreciation for those around us, even those we don\u2019t see eye to eye with.\nMark Lavelle did understand the people, the businesses, the livelihoods, the passion and the ups and downs of a living breathing moving ecosystem. He also understood business, and he knew what he needed to do to deliver.\nMark and myself didn\u2019t always agree, but I think we both understood each other\u2019s viewpoint, and more importantly why we were there. I will say as well, never once did I hear anyone say anything negative re Mark. I heard he was highly respected within Magento, and never \u2018elitist\u2019. He didn\u2019t need to give a damn in many situations, but he did, and he fought at times for this ecosystem I know that. He saw finally through his own eyes what a number of us see, he got it.\nLook everyone knew Magento would sell, it had to, it was never going to go to IPO. And its had a great run, some of us have been in this space now 11 years, its giving us a lot, and not many technologies last this long, and none have the people within like Magento.\nFor me I was pleased when Magento sold to Adobe as I then knew what was happening \u2014 I could build around that. With Mark Lavelle, well I\u2019ll miss him of course, but this is business, we have customers to deal with, companies to build, it was obvious he would go, and in some ways its better now so that we can build for tomorrow.\nSome people say Magento is over. It is not over, its transforming. This is a transition year. Is it the last Imagine? I don\u2019t know, but we should understand the chapter has turned, just like it did when eBay bought it and then again when it went standalone again. Every Imagine we should treat as our last, we should relish the here and the now, whilst being positive about our future wherever that may be.\nThe ecommerce landscape has changed. There are many more players, and you know what one platform doesn\u2019t suit all and that\u2019s okay. What we need now IMO is collaboration, partnership, a mutual respect for what each other does, and a willingness to double down on doing our job \u2014 delivering great technology and solutions to enable our merchants success.\nWhat do I want to do? I want to take on Amazon with the merchants, I want to bring the world within our reach because its a beautiful rich world, full of unique people, unique businesses and unique stories. Thank you Lavelle for touching on my own story, and thank you for listening to the ecosystem when it most needed you. Thank you for giving a damn. Now go bloody relax, then change something, because we truly have only just begun in the tech space, there is so much more we can and should do, and do now.\nNew Dawn, new day.

I would like to share a small story on why we should focus on building a solid architect of our projects.\n\u201cOnce upon a time in the year 2015. I was a novice competitive programmer(Hackerearth profile) and was also learning android app development. As a competitive programmer I only cared about the output and efficiency of the program I wrote. I never gave a second thought to structuring my programs or projects I wrote. This trend and style reflected in my android projects as well. I was writing android apps with a competitive programmer\u2019s mindset. At beginning when I was working on my own projects it was all good as I never had a boss or manager who can give me requirements to add new features or change existing features in the app. But when I started working in a startup and building android apps for them. I always took a lot of time to change an existing feature in the app. Not only that, I even added bugs as an add-on feature in the process of building the app. The main root cause of all these problems was, \u201cI never followed any architectural pattern or never structured my projects\u201d. As time passed and I started understanding the world of software, I transitioned myself from a competitive programmer to a software engineer. Today whenever I start a new project my primary focus is to build a solid structure or architecture of the project. That helped me to be a better and stress free software engineer \ud83d\ude04.\u201d\nPutting an end to my boring story \ud83d\ude05. Let\u2019s start working on the main goal of this article. \u201cArchitect your Flutter projects using BLOC pattern\u201d.\nI will be building a very simple app. It will have one screen where you can see a grid list of items. Those items will be fetched from the server. The list of items will be popular movies from The Movies DB site.\nNote: Before moving any further I assume you understand Widgets, how to make a network call in Flutter and have intermediate knowledge in Dart. This article will be little lengthy and heavily hyperlinked to other resources so that you can read further on specific topics.\nBefore diving directly into the code. Let me give you a visual experience of the architecture we will be following to structure this app.\nThe above diagram shows how the data flow from UI to the Data layer and vice versa. BLOC will never have any reference of the Widgets in the UI Screen. The UI screen will only observe changes coming from BLOC class. Let\u2019s have a small Q&A to understand this diagram:\nIts a state management system for Flutter recommended by Google developers. It helps in managing state and make access of data from a central place in your project.\nYes of course. MVP and MVVM are some good example. Only the thing that will change is: BLOC will be replaced with ViewModel in MVVM.\nSTREAMS or REACTIVE approach. In general terms, data will be flowing from the BLOC to the UI or from UI to the BLOC in the form of streams. If you have never heard about streams. Read this Stack Overflow answer.\nHope this small Q&A section cleared some of your doubts. If you need further clarity or want to ask a specific question, you can comment down below or connect directly with me at LinkedIn.\nLet\u2019s start building the project with BLOC pattern\nYou must be getting an error in the second line. We will solve it in the upcoming steps.\nNow create few new packages i.e blocs, models, resources and ui as shown in the below diagram and then we are set with the skeleton of the project:\nblocs package will hold our BLOC implementation related files. models package will hold the POJO class or the model class of the JSON response we will be getting from the server. resources package will hold the repository class and the network call implemented class. ui package will hold our screens that will be visible to the user.\nsync your project or type below command in terminal. Make sure you execute this command inside your project directory.\nhttp://api.themoviedb.org/3/movie/popular?api_key=\u201cyour_api_key\u201d\nPut your API key in the above link and hit(Remove double quotes as well). You can see the JSON response something like this:\nI hope you can map this file with the JSON response. If not, we are mostly interested in the poster_path inside the Results class that\u2019s what you need to know to move further. We will display all the posters of the popular movies in our main UI. fromJson() method is just getting the decoded json and putting the values in the correct variables.\nNote: Please put your API key in the variable _apiKey inside the movie_api_provider.dart file or else it won\u2019t work.\nfetchMovieList() method is making the network call to the API. Once the network call is complete its returning a Future ItemModel object if the network call was successful or it will throw an Exception.\nWe are importing the movie_api_provider.dart file and calling its fetchMovieList() method. This Repository class is the central point from where the data will flow to the BLOC.\nWe are importing a package import \u2018package:rxdart/rxdart.dart\u2019; which will eventually import all the RxDart related methods and classes in this file. Inside the MoviesBloc class we are creating the Repository class object which will be used to access the fetchAllMovies(). We are creating a PublishSubject object whose responsibility is to add the data which it got from the server in form of ItemModel object and pass it to the UI screen as stream. To pass the ItemModel object as stream we have created another method allMovies() whose return type is Observable(watch this video if you don\u2019t understand Observables). If you see the last line we are creating the bloc object. This way we are giving access to a single instance of the MoviesBloc class to the UI screen.\nIf you don\u2019t know what reactive programming is. Please read this simple explanation. In simple words, whenever there is new data coming from server. We have to update the UI screen. To make this updating task simple we are telling the UI screen to keep observing any change coming from the MoviesBloc class and accordingly update your content. This \u201cobserving\u201d of new data can be doing using RxDart.\nOne thing to point here, that I am making a network call inside the build method which should not be done as build(context) method can be called multiple times. I will be updating this article with a better approach. But for now as the article is getting big and complicated I am keeping things simple i.e making the network call inside the build(context) method.\nAs I told you, our MoviesBloc class is passing the new data as stream. So to deal with streams we have a nice inbuilt class i.e StreamBuilder which will listen to the incoming streams and update the UI accordingly. StreamBuilder is expecting a stream parameter where we are passing the MovieBloc\u2019s allMovies() method as it is returning a stream. So the moment there is a stream of data coming, StreamBuilder will re-render the widget with the latest data. Here the snapshot data is holding the ItemModel object. Now you can you any Widget to display whatever is there in the object(Here your creativity comes into the picture). I used a GridView to display all the posters that are there in the results list of ItemModel object. This is the output of the final product:\nSo we have hit the end of this article. Great job folks for holding on till the end. Hope you like this article. If you have any doubts or questions do connect with me at LinkedIn or Twitter.

Stream Chat also supports Push Notifications out of the box and implementing them into your own React Native app is a breeze. In this tutorial, we will show you how to create a sample React Native application from scratch with native push notifications that work on both Android and iOS devices.\nNote: This tutorial is not supported in Expo applications. We need access to the native code to get the device tokens required to send push notifications for Stream Chat. If you are hoping to integrate this into an existing Expo application, you will need to eject.\nFirst things first, make sure you\u2019ve created an account with Stream and created an app within the dashboard.\nTo make things easier, we are going to disable auth so that we can easily test push messages. Please note that this only suitable for test/dev environments. While in development mode, you can go to the Chat tab in the dashboard for your app, scroll down to Chat Events and enable the toggle for Disable Auth Checks. This means we don\u2019t need to send a valid user token \u2014 usually, we need to generate a valid user token from a server); You can find more details on generating a valid token for a production application using Stream here.\nOnce you\u2019re all set up, make sure you have your API key and secret in a safe spot for use later on this tutorial.\nNext, initialize your new project with the react-native init chat-push-example command in your terminal. You can rename chat-push-example to whatever you would like.\nNote: if you are adding this to an existing React Native project created with Expo or CRNA, you will need to eject. Please note that this ejecting is irreversible; however, it is required to access native iOS and Android capabilities.\nWe\u2019ll start by installing all the dependencies we need:\nFor iOS, we will be using Apple\u2019s APN service to power the push functionality, rather than Expo or Firebase Cloud Messaging.\nYou also need to link PushNotificationIOS which is exported from React Native. Open Xcode and in the sidebar on the left, make sure you\u2019re in the Project Navigator tab (the folder icon). Right click on the Libraries directory within your project name and select Add files to <Project_Name_Here>.\nA file dialog will pop-up. Navigate to the root of your project, then to your node_modules directory and to the path as shown below. Click Add.\nNow, click the root of your applications Xcode project in the navigator sidebar and click Build Phases in the tabs at the top of the middle pane. On the next screen, there are five dropdowns. Find the dropdown labeled Link Binaries with Libraries, expand it, and click the plus icon in the bottom left.\nThen, focus on the search box and type RCTPushNotification. You should see a file named libRCTPushNotification.a in the list. Select it and click Add.\nLast, add the following snippet to the bottom of your AppDelegate.m file which can be found here:\nNote: This code hooks up your iOS application to React Native\u2019s RCTPushNotificationMananager, allowing us to retrieve the device token and handle push notifications in our JavaScript code.\nUnfortunately, push notifications do not work in the iOS simulator, so you\u2019re going to need a physical iOS device to be able to see the fruits of your labor. If you want to run your React Native application on a device, you\u2019re going to have to edit the XCode project to include code signing and push capabilities.\nOpen up XCode and from the navigation bar on the left make sure your project is selected. Navigate to the General tab and under Signing, make sure you are logged in with your Apple Developer Account. Once logged in, select your development team and be sure to check Automatically Manage Signing.\nIn the General tab, under Identity, make sure your Bundle Identifier matches the one you used to configure push notifications with Stream. If you haven\u2019t done this yet, please head on over to https://getstream.io/chat/docs/#push_ios and then return to this tutorial.\nLastly, navigate to the Capabilities tab and make sure Push Notifications are enabled:\nYou\u2019re all set! Plug in your iOS device, select it from the run menu in XCode and press Run.\nFor Android, we\u2019ll be using Firebase Cloud Messaging to power push notifications. So first up, you\u2019ll need to go to the Firebase Console, create a new application OR select an existing project. Then, go to Project Settings and under the General tab. Click on Your Apps, add an Android application and download your google-services.json file \u2014 you need to put this in the root of your projects android directory.\nNow make sure google-services.json file is included in your Android project\u2019s dependencies by navigating to your project level build.gradle file (./android/build.gradle), opening it, and copying the following code into your dependencies like so:\nThen, in the same directory, find the settings.gradle file and copy the following file if it isn\u2019t already there.\nNote: When you previously ran react-native link, it should have added the necessary files; however, it\u2019s best to always double check. Linking can be temperamental at times.\nNext, navigate to ./android/app/src and check you have the res folder. If not, create it and inside create another folder values. Then create a new file name colours.xml whose content is the following:\nLinking may have also taken care of the next step, but once again, navigate to MainApplication.java in your projects android directory within android/app/src/main.\nAnd check it has these two parts, as highlighted with comments:\nAnd last but most certainly not least \u2014 go to android/app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml and copy the following (the comments below will help guide you for your particular setup):\nAnd that\u2019s it! We\u2019re ready to start writing some plain old React Native and booting up our Stream Chat client prepared to send Push Notifications.\nNow is a good time to boot your application on your preferred platform, if you haven\u2019t already, to check everything is going to plan without any dreaded red screens.\nThanks to react-native-push-notifications, we are provided a platform agnostic experience while still using native push on each platform! So first, before we send a notification, we\u2019ll quickly hook up the Stream client.\nOpen your App.js file in the root of your project. Check that componentDidMount exists. If the file does not exist add an async componentDidMount method to the class.\nNote: This is where you\u2019ll need your Stream application key from earlier. You\u2019ll also want to generate a user token at this step if you\u2019re not in development mode. If you are in production, see here:\nIf you went with development mode, check the note in the code below, uncomment the call to changeAppSettings, and then you can pass any string value as the token.\nFor the sake of this tutorial, we created a .env file to store these values and grab them using react-native-dotenv as shown above \u2014 a good idea for your API_KEY in any case, but your USER_ID and USER_TOKEN will likely come from elsewhere in a real-world setting, depending on your use-case.\nNow all that\u2019s left is to hook up react-native-push-notifications.\nBelow your client.setUser call in componentDidMount, add the following config (and remember to import PushNotification from \u2018react-native-push-notification\u2019; at the top).\nBelow are the iOS and Android parts respectively, however, you can use both at the same time if your application is cross-platform:\nThis is the bare minimum configuration to get react-native-push-notification handling push notifications within your application. You should have a look at their GitHub repo for a full reference to configuration options and settings.\nFor this section, if your building for iOS you\u2019ll need to plug in a real iOS device \u2014 push notifications won\u2019t work within the simulator. However, the Android emulator does support push notifications \u2014 just make sure you use an emulator with Google Play Services install (shown by the Play Store Icon in the AVD Manager)\nIf you enable the Remote JS Debugging when you boot your application, you should see the registered device with token <token> log appear in the console once you accept the permissions to allow notifications.\nOnce your device is registered, ensure sure you have the getstream-cli installed and configured with your API key and secret (along with the other required arguments):\n$ stream config:set\nAfter the configuration is complete, you can safely run the following command in your terminal:\n$ stream chat:push:test\nFirst, the CLI will prompt you for the ID of the user you want to send notifications to (you can find this in your .env \u2014 or wherever you stored it from earlier) \u2014 you then leave each remaining step blank to send a default notification to the devices registered to said user. For details information on the push CLI options, see here.\nIf all is well, you just heard a ding or a chime of some sort, and you\u2019re notification appeared on your device.

At the time, I was working as a full stack web developer for a Stockholm-based startup. It was my first dev job, and I\u2019d landed it barely a year earlier (which you can read more about in this article).\nSummer was approaching rapidly, and the otherwise fairly high work pace was getting slower by the day. During one week, when the product team\u2019s rotating tech support duty was mine, I was feeling a bit bored and frustrated with some of the bugs I was assigned to.\nIt was in this gloomy mood that my dad reached out to me about his intentions to build a mobile app for his company\u2019s customers. Although he knew my job kept me busy and didn\u2019t expect a full-time commitment, he asked if I wanted to be a part of the project in a more advisory type of role. Somewhat intellectually starved I said yes. Although it wasn\u2019t my original intention, this advisory role eventually resulted in me taking on the development of the app as lead developer.\nNow, you might be asking yourself \u2014 why would one even attempt to get into the mobile app space after just shy of a year of professional web development experience? Wouldn\u2019t it make more sense to keep specializing in that area while adding some years of experience to your resume?\nAbsolutely it would. But, being the hopeless generalist that I am, I committed several years ago to making career decisions not based on career strategy, but rather on what makes me happy. In other words: my resume is already a trainwreck that could probably not get more scattered and incoherent.\nOf course, career strategy and work life happiness aren\u2019t necessarily mutually exclusive. In fact, I was very happy with my former job and employer. I just happened to find another project that I felt even more passionately about.\nSo what was it that made this particular project that exciting? Even more exciting than working on a hyper-growth product used by thousands of companies in a team with some of the most awesome people I\u2019ve met? In three words: freedom, challenge and self-development.\nWhen I joined the project, my client had already received a few offers from some local digital agencies. Before I was even considering building the app on my own, I was asked to review them as a friendly favor. And I was just amazed by the low quality of the propositions.\nOne of them had sent some design sketches that were really sloppy and not at all in line with the brand presented on the client\u2019s website. Another agency proposed a ridiculous price with some even more ridiculous recurring fees. And a third didn\u2019t even seem to have done any pitch prep work whatsoever. And they all shared one thing: that they wanted to build the app with the hybrid framework Cordova.\nAnd that wasn\u2019t all. Although Cordova is completely free and open-source, one of them had even tried to hide the fact that this was the technology they used. Instead, they promoted their \u201cown\u201d internal mobile app platform \u2014 seemingly just some thin layer around Cordova \u2014 to justify a lock-in giving them exclusive app maintenance rights and making an eventual future handover complicated and expensive. Low-quality propositions.\nNow, I don\u2019t hold any grudge against hybrid frameworks. I use apps built with them all the time. Gmail, Slack, Atom and Figma to name a few. But at the time, I\u2019d been hearing about React Native for quite some time. How it allowed building cross-platform mobile apps using Javascript \u2014 that weren\u2019t hybrid!\nWhat now? Had iOS and Android somehow stealthily been sneaking in support for writing native apps in Javascript? Because last I checked, iOS apps had to be built with Objective-C or Swift, and Android apps with Java or Kotlin.\nOf course not. So how could React Native apps be called actual native apps? Short answer: APIs. It took me longer to get this than I dare to admit, but the way React Native apps can run natively on your smart phone is not by running Javascript, and not by compiling your Javascript to native code, but by making requests to APIs that render native components in Objective-C on iPhone and in Java on Android.\nIf you want to know more about React Native\u2019s fundamentals I\u2019d really recommend this super-pedagogical Quora answer, this React Conf talk by the amazing Parashuram N and the original unveiling of RN to the world.\nAlthough I didn\u2019t know this secret behind React Native\u2019s magic trick at the time, I knew that it was in fact running native code \u2014 which was also my main argument for not going with any of the Cordova solutions suggested by the agencies. I reckoned that if they wanted a mobile app, they should build a native app. And if they wanted an HTML/CSS/JS app, their money would be better spent simply improving the mobile experience of their web app.\nWhen I shared this with the client, they asked me if I knew someone who could build such an app. I told them I didn\u2019t. They asked me if I could do it. I told them I couldn\u2019t. Still, the seed had been planted, and I just couldn\u2019t keep myself from dabbling around with React Native based on their app specs.\nAnd before I knew it, a foundation for their app was already in place. So somehow, just a few weeks after that conversation we\u2019d agreed that I would build the app for them.\nBefore we dive into the more techy details, a brief description of what type of app we\u2019re dealing with here seems to be in place.\nThe client is a Stockholm-based company that operates coworking spaces. In other words, workspace hotels for companies. They currently have some 10 active spaces where about 400 companies with about 1,400 employees rent office space. These tenants are the target group of the app.\nAfter some discussions back and forth with the project manager, a few app specs crystallized:\nAs you can tell, it\u2019s a pretty slim set of features. Which is exactly what you want for your first app with a new technology. If you want to know how the end result turned out (and whether the rest of this text is worth your time or not), here\u2019s an overview of the 1.0 version:\nYou\u2019re still here? Great, then let\u2019s move on.\nSo imagine you\u2019ve promised a friend to build them a house. But you have no idea how to build a house. Barely even where to start. What\u2019s the first thing you\u2019d do?\nYou find yourself a carpenter.\nSo that\u2019s what I tried to do. And did I hit the jackpot. After just a few hours of researching the React Native learning resources out there, I found a 13-part video course from Harvard on Youtube (completely free). Each lecture deep-diving into its own topic for between 90\u2013120 minutes each. So about 23 hours of high quality material in total.\nImmediately, I started consuming the video lectures as if possessed. And after just a few weeks of coding along during nights and weekends, I\u2019d finished the course and set myself up with a pretty decent app base.\nIn hindsight it\u2019s without a doubt one of the best learning resources I\u2019ve found, all categories. The packed and always relevant curriculum absolutely played a big part, but the teacher Jordan Hayashi was definitely the big win here. I\u2019d describe his teaching style as fast, hyper-practical and straight to the point. No time wasted on bad jokes and distracting personal anecdotes. Unlike yours truly...\nAnyhow, somehow each lecture always seemed to compress an amount of information that would take most other teachers at least twice the time. In other words, a style very similar to Harvard CS50 teacher David J Malan.\nSo if you\u2019re looking for a starting point for your first RN app, this would be my #1 recommendation. One caveat though: in the course, Jordan uses the Expo toolchain, which is a great tool for most simple apps as it does a lot of the nitty gritty work for you. But if you, like me, are building the foundation for what might become a quite big and complex app sooner rather than later, where you value total configuration freedom, react-native init might be a more appropriate solution.\nThe second best learning resource I had access to was actually my colleagues. By a lucky coincidence, we were just getting started with a React Native project at the company where I worked until just a few months ago. Although I wasn\u2019t on the project myself, I learned a ton from just talking to the guys on the project and reviewing their PRs.\nNow that we\u2019ve got all the contextual things sorted out, we can finally move on to the more technical stuff!\ud83e\udd16\nAfter getting the app foundation set up using react-native init, one of the first challenges was to get comfortable with a new development environment.\nIf you\u2019re coming from the average web development environment, many things will stay the same. For me that included keeping Atom as my text editor, iTerm as my terminal and GitUp as my git interface (to the groaning Vim users out there: haters gonna hate). But other than that React Native required a few additions to my usual work flow.\nGetting cozy with the iOS simulator, for instance. While running \u201creact-native run-ios\u201d from your command line sounds deceptively simple, in the beginning it was rarely enough to get the simulator up and running. As new npm packages were added to the project almost daily (and later on also quite a few native CocoaPod modules), I had to get more familiar then I\u2019d preferred with the painful ritual of clearing watchman, removing the haste cache, deleting the node_modules directory, reinstalling all the node modules again and resetting the Metro Bundler cache. The following command will do all this for you:\n9 times out of 10 that dance would be enough to get the simulator going again. And sometimes it required delving deep into various GitHub issues and Stackoverflow threads.\nThe root of some other pains was that I for a long time thought that opening Xcode was required to achieve certain things. And believe me, you want to spend as little time as possible in that horror house of an IDE (more on that later).\nLike telling the simulator to run a certain iPhone version. If someone would have told me that the line below did exactly that for me, straight from the command line, I would probably have been a slightly happier person during those first months.\nAnother example would be the 3 stage rocket required when going from Release mode (for deploying the app to App Store or some CI destination like Visual Studio App Center or Firebase) to Debug mode (dev mode). Perhaps obvious to many, these changes could also be made directly from your text editor of choice. Anyhow, just two small things that had a surprisingly big impact on my work flow when working in dev mode.\nLastly, it took some time to get used to constantly having to jump between different macOS apps to do things I would normally do in Chrome when working with web apps.\nTo inspect my Javascript console logs and HTML/CSS output for style debugging, I turned to React Native Debugger. And to keep track of app state, actions dispatched and API requests/responses I used Reactotron. While I found both these apps immensely useful, I couldn\u2019t help but miss my corresponding Ember.js workflow, where I could do all of these things in the same place that my app was actually running (with the help of the Ember Inspector Chrome plugin).\nNavigation/routing has apparently been a pretty hard problem to solve in React Native. Four years in, there\u2019s plenty of different solutions out there, but still no obvious consensus on which one is the best. I decided to go with react-navigation, but mostly due to that being the solution used in both the Harvard course and in the project my colleagues worked on.\nHowever, if I would have taken the time to do some proper research, I might have made the following findings:\nConsidering the above, I would probably still have chosen react-navigation, since I would not have had the time to test them all, as for instance Kurtis Kemple at MLS did. Lastly, as he explains in his talk, picking a navigation solution is not really a question about which one is the best as much as a question about which one best suits your particular needs.\nAfter working with react-navigation for about 9 months, I have to say I don\u2019t really have much to complain about. Seeing as my main point of reference was the router.js library used in Ember.js, it was an entirely new routing experience.\nGetting to know react-navigation\u2019s three main types of navigators was the easy part (StackNavigator, TabNavigator and DrawerNavigator). The hard part was understanding how the navigators should be nested with one another to get the intended user flow.\nFor instance, that my DrawerNavigator was supposed to be at the navigation root (one step above my main TabNavigation) was not at all obvious to me. If this is hard to picture, here\u2019s the DrawerNavigator in action (much smoother in reality than in the gif):\nAs you can see, I wanted a sidebar that could be opened with a swipe of the thumb from anywhere in the app.\nSeeing as a sidebar is more of a secondary component in an app compared to the main bottom tab bar, my first intuition here was that the DrawerNavigator should be placed underneath or in parallel with the central BottomTabNavigator position in the route tree (see image below).\nHowever, after banging my head against the wall trying to force-squeeze the sidebar in there, I found that the react-navigation way would actually be to put the DrawerNavigator one step above the BottomTabNavigator, i.e. at the root of the route tree. Hopefully this heads up will save someone out there the fair amount of hours I spent in the docs and GitHub issue threads to get to this insight.\nHere\u2019s another illustration with the DrawerNavigator at the root:\nOne question you might ask yourself is: why both a StackNavigator and a TabNavigator for both Community and Conference? Why not just skip the stack layer and go straight to the tabs?\nWell, because I wanted a header on top of each of the two TabNavigators. These guys:\nAgain, my intuition and the react-navigation way of doing things diverged. Seeing as the createMaterialTopTabNavigator must be a pretty standard navigation component, I figured it should have a simple built-in header config in it\u2019s navigationOptions. Turns out it doesn\u2019t, which is why I was forced to use a StackNavigator in between, thus adding another layer of complexity to the infrastructure for a purely superficial purpose.\nThis flaw in react-navigation also caused me some more serious problems. Namely, getting the header images to collapse/disappear when a user scrolls down in any of the two FlatLists. Since the headers of Home and Selection are rendered within the same StackNavigator as their lists, here this could easily be solved by simply letting the header scroll up together with the rest of the list.\nBut with Community and Conference \u2014 since the headers are rendered in StackNavigators, and the lists in TabNavigators one step beneath them in the tree \u2014 I found no way to apply the same solution to them. Hence I\u2019m left with this painful asymmetry:\nNow this may not appear as an issue on the iPhone X running in the simulator above, but on smaller screens that header might take up some 20% of valuable screen area. If anyone has an idea how to get around this, I\u2019m all ears!\nThe same TabNavigator issue also caused a problem in the Community destination. As demonstrated below, I wanted to put another TabNavigator inside the Coworking Spaces tab, to get the three top tabs Info, Members and Contact visible on the right side of the gif.\nHowever, since TabNavigator made it really hard to put an image slideshow on top of it without adding a ton of complexity causing all sorts of other navigation headaches (mainly related to navigation params), I had to resort to a JS package called react-native-swiper to deal with those three tabs instead. And I would actually have been totally fine with that, if it wasn\u2019t for the quite unsmooth slide animations of the tab underlines. Anyway, I deemed it a fair price to avoid the alternative navigation headaches.\nTo sum up my experience with navigation in React Native:\nWhen running a new react-native init app on your simulator, reloading the app over and over again every time you make a change, you will quickly become aware of the need for a pretty launch screen (also called splash screen).\nAnd since there\u2019s already a really great guide for how to achieve this, I will not waste any of our time repeating the author\u2019s words. I only ran into one problem here that the guide did not cover:\nIt\u2019s pretty much an iOS edge case, but still something that will likely bother the few users exposed to it. I discovered it first when I was working someplace where I could not access the wifi, and thus was sharing the 4G from my phone with my laptop. As iPhone users will know, the status bar on the device will turn blue and get an increased height while internet sharing. And it totally broke my splash screen image when running on device. The same problem appeared when in-call.\nSo after a while of digging around in the react-native-splash-screen repo and not finding anything helpful, I decided to work around the problem by hiding the status bar completely while the splash screen was visible.\nIt\u2019s super easy, all you need to do is add a UIStatusBarHidden key with the boolean value of true to your info.plist file, and then set the React Native StatusBar component\u2019s \u201chidden\u201d prop to false after SplashScreen.hide() has been called.\n\u201cConvention over configuration\u201d is a mantra I feel like I\u2019ve been hearing every single day for the past two years. Not least at my former employer. Not very surprisingly, since we used Ruby on Rails on the server side and Ember.js on the client side \u2014 two frameworks basically synonymous with that saying. I thought I knew what those words meant, but the process of learning how to handle state in React Native gave them a whole new meaning.\nAlthough I\u2019d played around with the \u201cconfiguration over convention\u201d React library for the web in a few very simple demo apps, I\u2019d never built anything big enough to justify bringing in a state container like Redux or MobX. Instead, most of my JS state management experience came from Ember Data (Ember\u2019s built-in state management and data persistence library).\nSince Redux was the go-to solution I\u2019d heard people talk about for years on podcasts, blogs and in videos (including Jordan in the RN Youtube course), I never really considered any of it\u2019s contenders. I just wanted to set up the best possible state management infrastructure with the least possible effort.\nIn Ember you are basically given 90% of this infrastructure for free. Little did I know that I would have to accept the opposite ratio in my current project. Not only won\u2019t React provide you with anything useful to handle global state, but Redux \u2014 the most popular solution on the market \u2014 is so light-weight that you\u2019ll basically have to pull 90% of the weight yourself the get an equal state solution.\nNow that the slightly younger me got that out of his system, the hard part was actually just getting a hang of this new functional and immutable work flow. Once I\u2019d accepted the surprising amount of new complexity needed to simply fetch or post some data from/to my server, it all boiled down to 7 pretty straightforward steps:\nRedux and redux-saga surely have so much more to offer, but as far as I\u2019m currently concerned, the above 7 steps are essentially what Redux is for me.\nSo we\u2019ve got our React Native dev environment set up, a navigation tree mapped out, and a state management infrastructure in place. What would be a good next step? Well, for me the natural choice was user authentication, thus getting into sessions.\nIf you\u2019re coming to React Native from a web background, dealing with sessions will not require much brain compute power. If you\u2019re in any way familiar with the concept of LocalStorage, you simply need to replace it with AsyncStorage: an abstraction layer that will let you persist key-value pairs across sessions. In other words perfect for storing an authentication token generated from your server when a user logs in.\nOverall, my impression is that lists is a fairly well-solved problem in React Native. Basically, you have three options at hand: If you\u2019re dealing with a static list whose data doesn\u2019t change, ScrollView will likely suffice. If you\u2019re dealing with a list that\u2019s bigger and dynamic, FlatList is what you want. And if you want a bigger and dynamic list that\u2019s also divided into different sections, SectionList is your answer.\nI exclusively used FlatList for my dynamic lists. And while I intuitively like it and its massive set of configuration options, I experienced a few quite painful situations. Below I\u2019ll go through them one by one.\nPull to refreshFlatList has a prop called refreshControl, to which you can pass a component you want to use for refreshing the list content, triggered when the user pulls downward from the top of the list. Lucky for us, React Native has a component just for that purpose \u2014 RefreshControl . All very intuitive and easy to set up.\nHowever, I ran into a weird situation, where the refreshControl prop and/or the RefreshControl component seemed to be the ones to blame. Some background:\nSo in my lists I want users to be able to a) scroll up at the top to refresh the list, triggering a function I named handleRefresh() and b) scroll down to load more items into the list, aka. \u201cinfinite scrolling\u201d (more on that further down). Pretty standard stuff.\nHowever, after a while I started getting these situations where the refresh spinner would just freeze and keep spinning forever, not displaying the new items fetched from the server. After quite some time of researching, I found the reason for my problem in this GitHub issue response.\nThe problem was that both the refreshControl and onEndReached (for infinite scrolling) props were making use of the same boolean prop: \u201cfetching\u201d. And for some weird reason, when this fetching prop would change from false to true and then back to true again, within a time interval of less than 250ms, RefreshControl would break and the loading spinner freeze.\nSo to try this theory out, I tried adding a setTimeout(), setting a minimum time interval of 350ms between changing the value of the fetching boolean. And it fixed the problem. But since using setTimeout felt a bit too hacky for my taste, I ultimately landed on the solution of simply using two different props for the handleRefresh() and handleLoadMore() functions: \u201crefreshing\u201d and \u201cloadingMore\u201d. Not sure how common this problem is, but hopefully my workaround can save someone some time and frustration.\nNote that the official documentation recommends using onRefresh and refreshing instead of the refreshControl prop. The reason I went with refreshControl was that I didn\u2019t see any other way to be able to customize the style of the spinner.\nInfinity scrollingAs mentioned above, I also wanted to give my users the feeling as if the list was completely seamless. Meaning not having to press any \u201cLoad more\u201d button at the bottom to load more items, and not having to get some blocking loading spinner or loading placeholders covering also the already loaded list item\u2019s while fetching more items.\nFor this purpose, onEndReached had basically everything I needed. I had two problems while implementing it though.\nThe first was wrapping my head around the onEndReachedThreshold prop, which will tell your FlatList when to trigger the function passed to onEndReached. After some trial and error, my explanation would be this:\nIf you have 100 items loaded into your list and the screen fits 10 items at a time, a onEndReachedThreshold value of 1 would mean that the onEndReached function will be called when you scroll past the 90th item in your list. If the value is 2, the function will be called already when you\u2019re within 2 screen heights from the end, i.e. at the 80th item, and so on.\nThe second problem I ran into with infinite scrolling was what I can only assume is a FlatList bug. Namely, that every single time I scrolled down passed the threshold, my handleLoadMore() function passed to the onEndReached prop would be called repeatedly, often more than 10 times in a row.\nCoincidentally, once again the solution could be found in making use of the loadingMore prop, adding an if statement in the handleLoadMore() function making sure the fetch action was only dispatched if !loadingMore. Naturally, you\u2019d also want to check in that same if statement that you\u2019re not on the last page in your server pagination.\nLoading placeholdersSomething that wouldn\u2019t necessarily have any effect on the user experience, but most definitely would have made me happier as a developer, would be the presence of a ListLoadingComponent prop in FlatList, just like there\u2019s a ListHeaderComponent, a ListEmptyComponent and a ListFooterComponent.\nSince there is not, I was forced to rely on clumsy if statements to handle the placeholder rendering in plenty of render() functions.\nScroll to topThe final list topic I\u2019d like to touch upon is scrolling to the top of the list with the press of a button. In my app, I currently have these buttons in the headers, but another common location for them is in the bottom tab buttons.\nTo achieve this I used the FlatList scrollToOffset method, which is simple enough to understand from the docs. However, a crucial detail which I could not find in the docs was that you also need to make use of the ref prop in the FlatList component, like so:\nWhat this does is basically giving your FlatList an identifier, so that it can be called from a function elsewhere. So in my case it allowed me to call the ScrollToOffset function from my handleScrollToTop() function, and for instance pass it as a parameter to my react-navigation navigation object, allowing it to be called from any route the param is passed to.\nNote that after upgrading to react-navigation 3, the ref thingy was no longer needed since the createBottomTabNavigator buttons will now handle scroll to top by default.\nImages, I\u2019ve come to learn, runs the biggest risk of becoming the one thing that makes your mobile app suck. Naturally, efficient image handling is important also on the web, but since phones will run on 4G (or 3G, god forbid) to a much larger extent, a lower average download speed must be assumed, which in turn could make your app seem slow.\nImages will also likely take up a bigger share of the phone screen compared to the computer screen, why they should also be given a higher priority from a cosmetic perspective. So although it might not be the most fun part of it all, investing some time into it will probably be worth it.\nMy app turned out to be quite heavy on image content. It totals 7 lists with list items with image props that are not only displayed in the actual list items, but also on each item\u2019s own \u201cdetails\u201d (the screen a user get\u2019s redirected to when pressing a list item).\nUploading imagesOn the user account edit screen, the app would also allow users to upload an avatar image. For this I used the react-native-image-picker library, along with Cloudinary and Carrierwave on my Rails backend.\nAt first I put all the uploading logic on the client side, using Cloudinary\u2019s Node API and the react-native-fetch-blob module. But after a while, since I wanted a bit more flexibility in my uploading logic and didn\u2019t want to put too much complex logic on the React Native side, I moved it all to the Rails backend.\nHowever, I ran into some troubles while trying to post the images to my server using react-native-fetch-blob. Hence, the additional complexity and the at the time very uncertain maintenance status of the repo made me choose the built-in JS FormData API instead. Note however that the no longer maintained react-native-fetch-blob repo has since been moved to rn-fetch-blob, where it is being actively maintained.\nDisplaying imagesTruth is, the standard React Native Image tag, with its style, source and resizeMode props will take you a long way. If you don\u2019t care about caching, displaying multiple images or some other fancy special case you probably won\u2019t need to bring in other dependencies.\nHowever, I found two cases where I actually found it worth the effort of adding to my list of dependencies. The first was the circular avatar-formatted images shown in some of the list cards and the user profile screens. For that, the react-native-elements Avatar came in handy.\nHowever, this component does nothing that you can\u2019t achieve yourself with some extra styling to the default Image component. So unless you\u2019ve already brought in the library for some other purposes, I wouldn\u2019t recommend adding this dependency for the single purpose of avatar-formatting.\nThe other case where I decided to outsource was when displaying multiple images in a slideshow (see gif). For this I used the react-native-slideshow library, which did exactly what I wanted.\nBut beware, since it\u2019s poorly maintained I\u2019d strongly recommend forking it and trimming the code a bit rather than use as is from your node_modules.\nLoading placeholdersSo with 7 infinite scroll lists displaying images, the user is bound to do some waiting while all this data is being fetched from the server. As we all know, waiting is probably the single most frustrating experience in modern technology. So naturally we want to make it as endurable as possible.\nEnter placeholders.\nI\u2019m not really sure why, but any time I wait for some content to load, I get a billion times more frustrated if all I get is a loading spinner (or even worse \u2014 nothing at all), than if I see some shiny, dynamic placeholders a\u0301 Facebook news feed style. So that\u2019s what I was going for.\nThankfully, I wasn\u2019t the first one to have that idea in React Native. It didn\u2019t take much research before I could confidently settle on two libraries: react-native-loading-placeholder (for the actual placeholders) and react-native-linear-gradient (for the shiny animations). I was really happy with the result, even if I may have taken it a bit too far with the one to the right...\nCachingYes, caching is a thing also in the native world. Strangely enough though, there\u2019s still no built-in support for it in the default RN Image tag. Instead, you\u2019ll have use the CachedImage tag from this great lib: react-native-cached-image.\nBasically, all you need to do is install the npm package and exchange all the default Image tags you want to cache with CachedImage. You can then check your Reactotron timeline to confirm that the images are actually being stored.\nCompared to the minimal effort required to set up image caching, the payoff is huge. Seeing my Cloudinary bandwidth drop from a hefty 95% of the free monthly quota to about 4% was sooo satisfying.\nPro tip: add the prop activityIndicatorProps={{ animating: false }} and roll your own loading placeholder rather than the standard loading spinner while loading images.\nTime pickerReact Native actually has a cross-platform Picker component. However, due to it\u2019s very configurable nature (and my impatience), I looked around for a JS library that had already done some of the work for me. Luckily, I found react-native-picker-select, which emulates the native <select> interfaces for iOS and Android for my almost exactly my purposes.\nSince it\u2019s basically just a single Javascript file using built-in React Native components (and some lodash, which was already a dependency of mine), I decided to simply steal the code \u2014 with some small adjustments\u2014 and put it in my own picker component. From then on, I use it not only for my time pickers for all input lists except for the date picker.\nDate pickerI decided to go with Wix\u2019s react-native-calendars library for a few reasons:\nHate it or love it, this was the result:\nTime zonesTime zones. So simple in theory, yet so hard in reality.\nTowards the end of the project, I was integrating the app\u2019s backend with a third-party SaaS that the client use for their room bookings. I\u2019d just had the pleasure of getting intimate with the good old SOAP protocol to set up the necessary API requests for the Conference section of the app. And when I finally had all the pieces in place, I started noticing some strange time behaviors on the React Native side.\nThe client company had made it explicit that they didn\u2019t want users to be able to make new bookings on today\u2019s date after 5pm that day, for reasons. But due to the Javascript Date object\u2019s strict UTC time zone default, generating this max value for the time picker proved to be pretty tricky. In fact, so tricky that the logic bloated my component with too much complexity for my taste. Please let there be a library for this, I thought to myself.\nMy prayers were answered by moment-js, which not only was totally compatible with React Native, but also had a specific time zone module that generated the perfect boolean for me in a single line:\nCustom fonts and icons \u2014 two tiny details with huge impact on the UI and branding of your app. Coming from a web background, I expected this to be a headache in proportion with the file conversion and font-face css file assembly dance I was used to.\nBut the work of other people before me made this a lot more painless than I\u2019d expected. Following this tutorial, it took me about 10 minutes to import the client company\u2019s custom fonts. And the vast icon library of react-native-vector-icons, together with some custom imports, has so far provided me with all I need in terms of icons.\nMoving on to CI/CD \u2014 the livelihood of devops people, and the #1 configuration nightmare of all lone-ranging developers looking to make a quick buck.\nSince I was (and still am) the only one working on this app, it might seem a bit overkill for some. Since there\u2019s no code collaboration, all new deployments will come from the same computer, and I could just as easily build and test the app locally before pushing to the GitHub repo and submitting a new release to the app stores. However, for a few simple reasons I still considered a CI solution necessary:\nSo I was determined to implement a CI solution. But up until this point, I had assumed that this would be isolated to building and testing, and that I would have to find separate solutions for e.g. error reporting, analytics and push notifications. Not to mention continuous deployments, which didn\u2019t even seem to exists in the world of native.\nAnd then I found Visual Studio App Center. This Chain React 2017 talk by Parashuram N (again) completely blew my mind. What he presented seemed to include all the different devops services I\u2019d considered adding one by one, in one single solution: building, testing, diagnostics (error reporting), analytics, push notifications AND continuous deployment with Codepush. Not to mention distribution to the app stores and beta testers. And best of all, it would enable managing all these things for both my iOS and Android app in the same place. And the best of the best of all, it would likely be free until the app grew bigger, about a year or so later.\n\u201cThis is too good to be true\u201d, I thought to myself with teary eyes, panting from excitement. It was just so beautiful. So seamless. So developer-friendly (API-first). And yet with such a user-friendly UI, to the extent that also non-technical employees at my client could make sense of it (some of it).\nHow could all this be possible, you ask? Well, turns out Microsoft has been on a shopping spree lately. To assemble the goodie bag that VSAC is, they acquired a bunch of existing independent solutions like Codepush (continuous RN deployments) and HockeyApp (test distribution and crash reporting), as well as built and extended existing Microsoft products. The famous \u201cdevelopers, developers, developers, developers\u201d ethos signed Steve Balmer really seems to run truer than ever in the company\u2019s bloodstream.\nSo, had I heard enough to make an informed bet on this fairly new technology, discarding competing services like Fastlane, BuddyBuild and Firebase? Well, if it was truly as good as Parashuram claimed, it would save me weeks of installations and configurations, and probably countless hours of future maintenance of all the scattered services required to put together a similar result. Either way, it was definitely worth a shot.\nAnd about a week later the app was all set up with all of the VSAC features. Except for a few child diseases, the docs together with the support chat supplied me with all the answers I needed.\nOne such problem was the fact that they did not yet support integrating with Apple Developer accounts using two-factor authentication (which Apple started enforcing just in time for me to get my account set up...). This was incredibly frustrating to me at the time, but just a few weeks after I\u2019d reported it, they added official support for it.\nIf you find my praise of VSAC a bit one-sided, and would like to hear the opinion of someone with a big app perspective, I\u2019d recommend this more skeptical CI/CD review.\nWith all the iOS groundwork in place, I found adding support for Android very painless. After setting up the Android Studio dev environment and getting the app running on an Android emulator, most of the issues could be solved with the React Native Platform module. For platform-specific styling, it offers the Platform.select() method. And for all other platform-specific code Platform.OS will do the trick.\nAlso, getting the app submitted and approved on the Google Play Store was SO much easier than for App Store. Why?\nEvidently, approaching React Native as a web developer is bound to cause a few headaches. But for me, the worst headache by far was the development process imposed by Apple. I honestly can\u2019t recall ever having experienced that many bottlenecks and schedule postponements caused by one single source. Technical project or otherwise.\nMainly, I\u2019d say the inexplicably high degree of bureaucracy is to blame. If there\u2019s one thing you can count on when developing your first iOS app, it\u2019s that you\u2019ll make a ton of new friends along the way.\nThe guys and gals at the Apple Support, for instance. You might have to convince them that the company behind your app actually exists. You might also make a few friends at Dun & Bradstreet, their company identification partner. And while you\u2019re at it, you might even make some friends over at your local governmental company registry, in order to update your company address to a format that Apple supports (they don\u2019t support companies registered on a post office box, which is a very common practice at least here in Scandinavia).\nAnd then you might get to spend even more time with the Apple Support people, since they still won\u2019t be able to approve your Apple Developer registration seeing as you\u2019re just a consultant, and not an actual employee of your client company. The whole process might take more than a month. But who cares when you\u2019re making new friends, right?\nAnd the fun doesn\u2019t end there.\nYou\u2019ve got your Apple Developer company account all set up. You\u2019ve finished the 1.0 version of your app. Now you\u2019re dying to get it out into the wild.\nWell, you can\u2019t just yet. First, you\u2018re up for some digital paperwork. You\u2019ll have to generate a provisioning profile, an iOS certificate, an identifier, a .p12 Apple push notification certificate and the good old dSym file. And once you\u2019ve generated, configured and uploaded all those files to the right places, you can start the actual app review process.\nAccording to themselves, 50% of all apps are approved/rejected within 24 hours, and 90% within 48 hours. But prepare for the worst, since rejection is apparently just a normal part of life as an Apple Developer.\nLuckily, my app only got rejected one time. It was due to \u201cMetadata Rejected\u201d reasons. And I would totally have been okay with that if I\u2019d simply forgotten to fill in some required information. But seeing as the missing meta data apparently was 5 very specific questions (non of them included in the App Store Review Guidelines), it honestly just made me sad.\nSad to live in a world where just two companies are gatekeeping the entire native mobile app distribution pipeline. Sad that at least one of them cares so little about the customer that they allow themselves to arbitrarily take up other people\u2019s time, causing months of expensive app launch delays. And so so happy that the same does not apply for the web (yet).\nEvidently, developing my first React Native app for iOS included layers upon layers of bureaucratic screening processes. If there\u2019s an equivalent of a dementor in the world of mobile development, this is most definitely it. It will literally suck the soul along with any eventual developer happiness right out of your body.\nThere. Rant over. That felt good.\nAs noted earlier, this project was started in the early summer. As such, the slower summer work pace at my job made it possible to juggle the two for a few months. But eventually the Oct/Nov deadline would just be coming at me way too fast, and I would realize I\u2019d have to make a choice whether to stay in the job or finish the app on time. After a few weeks of contemplation, I chose the latter.\nAlthough it was a really tough decision, in hindsight I think it was the right one. The freedom, challenge and self-development I was looking for were most definitely found, and then some.\nRegarding the freedom, the loose leash of the client has basically allowed me to work from anywhere I want, anytime I want. Which has had a positive impact on many aspects of my life. It\u2019s enabled me to get my 8 hours of sleep more or less every night. It\u2019s enabled me to find a more consistent workout routine. It\u2019s enabled me to find more time for the people I care about. And working while traveling.\nOn the negative side though, this freedom has also often made the process quite lonely. Even when working among people in cafe\u0301s and coworking spaces, the absence of actual teammates to share the ups and downs with has been crystal clear.\nIn terms of challenge and self-development, I find the project taught me in just 6\u20137 months what probably would have taken me at least a few years in any normal job. It\u2019s basically made me a better developer in every area, including:\nSince I don\u2019t have any experience neither from any other mobile native JS tools like Flutter or NativeScript, nor from Objective-C, Swift, Java or Kotlin, I will not attempt to make any claim whether React Native is better or worse than the competition.\nBut what I can say is that as a web developer, React Native made the transition to mobile a very stimulating, developing and an overall smooth experience. Admittedly, the technology is young and far from perfect. But I for one would not hesitate to use it again.\nThanks for reading!

For example, we could add an interpolation to print numbers using various styles, like this:\nYou can call `appendLiteral()` as many times as you need, or even not at all if necessary.

Imagine that you have two views with a different layout that need to be populated with data from the same model class. MVVM allows you to use data from a single model class and represent it in different ways to populate a view.\nThese hold the app data. These are the structs and classes that you have created to hold the data you receive from a REST API or from some other data source.\nThese display UI elements on the screen. These are usually classes that subclass UIView and use UIKit.\nThese classes are where you take the information from the model classes and transform them into values that can be displayed in a particular view.\nUse this pattern to transform data from a model class to a representation that works for a different view. For example, you can use a view model to transform a String to an NSAttributedString or a Date into a formatted String.\nThis pattern is similar to MVC, which is perhaps why it is relatively simple to add it to an MVC codebase. All you need to do is simply add your view model classes to the existing codebase and use them to represent the data as you need it. This does minimize the role of the View Controller, which helps lift some weight off your View Controller classes. You too can avoid \u2018Massive View Controller\u2019.\nDisclaimer: MVVM can\u2019t help you avoid a massive view controller problem on its own. You can diversify the load on a view controller class by using design patterns in conjunction with each other, like the delegate pattern, singleton pattern etc.\nLet\u2019s see how MVVM works in code.\nOpen up Xcode and create a new Playground project. Select Single View under the iOS tab to start. Click on the assistant editor (icon with two intersecting circles) to display the Live View window. You should see this.\nYou can go ahead and delete the MyController class. We will be setting up our views manually.\nLet\u2019s pretend we are working on a bird store app. Let\u2019s start by creating a model class for Birds. Right below the closing brace for MyViewController class add the following class.\nEvery bird has a name, rarity level, and an image. Let\u2019s assume we need to show these properties on a view. The rarity property is an enum that we can\u2019t display on a view without some kind of representation that is useful for a view element to render. This is a perfect time for us to create a bird view model for this representation. Let\u2019s try to display the price of each bird as a string based on the rarity level of the bird.\nAdd the following class to your playground.\nHere\u2019s what\u2019s going on in the view model code:\nNow let\u2019s write code for the UIView that we will use to display information from the view model class. Add the following class to your playground file.\nYou can download the image being used by the imageView here. Add it to the Resources folder in the Project Navigator and rename it \u201cswifty.png\u201d.\nNow that we have our bird view class set up lets add the code to see it in the playground live view. Add the following after the closing brace of the BirdView class.\nHere\u2019s what\u2019s going on\nYou can see the live view by selecting View>Assistant Editor>Show Assistant Editor from the top menu bar.\nIf you find yourself needing to use data from a model class in views with different representations of the data it would make sense to use the MVVM pattern. MVVM is probably not going to be the starting point of your app. You will probably start with MVC. Keep an eye on your requirements, you can always introduce MVVM (and most other design patterns) at a later time in your codebase.\n", "link": "https://medium.freecodecamp.org/an-overview-of-the-mvvm-design-pattern-in-swift-fb815ea5da40", "author": "Azhar", "comments": [], "claps": "444 claps"}, {"num_comments": "unspecified", "title": "Earn 6.5% on EUR.

In this essay, I\u2019d like to do something similar with another inspirational character \u2014 the Czech-Canadian polymath Vaclav Smil.\nSmil was a little-known academic until he rose into public awareness thanks to Bill Gates. Gates has read all of Smil\u2019s books (there are over 30 of them) and goes as far as to say, \u201cI learn more by reading Vaclav Smil than just about anyone.\u201d\nMany of Smil\u2019s books focus on environmental themes such as population growth, climate change, and energy transitions. These fields are rife with political bias and emotional reasoning, but Smil manages to say important, interesting things in a way that is neither deluded nor dogmatic.\nHere are a few things I\u2019m learning from him on how to think clearly.\nAs Philip Tetlock has shown in his book Superforecasting, the clearest thinkers tend to be those that draw from multiple disciplines. I call these people dragonfloxes \u2014 they can do many things (like a fox) and also see the world in many ways (like dragonflies, which have many eyes).\nSmil is a dragonflox. At age 74, he continues to read 80+ books a year (while still finding the time to write up to 3 books in a single year):\nThis habit of learning, it seems, started when Smil was still a student:\nThough I don\u2019t know the details, I find it interesting that Smil refused to join the Communist party as a student. One problem with Marxism is that it puts too much faith in its model of how history works. Marx thought that history moved in predictable phases, converging on a paradise in the future where humans lived as equals.\nConfusing models with reality is a cardinal sin of clear thinking. If you believe too strongly in your models of the world, you can start to ignore evidence that your model is wrong.\nSmil is not a fan of models. When, in the 1870s, the influential book The Limits to Growth used a computer model to predict impending doom, Smil was skeptical.\nFrom an article in Science magazine:\nIf you look at history, it becomes clear how easy it is for humans to fool themselves with faulty forecasts and myth-driven theories. In the face of that, the only proper stance, I think, is intellectual humility.\nSmil has humility. He refuses to make long-term forecasts (because he knows they are useless) and instead focuses only on saying what is worth saying:\nThis is the opposite of what many pundits and political commentators do. People will always need certainty where no certainty exists. In this sense, pundits and long-term forecasters are the priests and faith healers of our time.\nThose interested in the truth, though, will have to learn to live with uncertainty.\nAnother interesting thing about Smil is that he has principles. In particular, you can tell he that he values intellectual honesty far more than he values fame or material wealth.\nSmil lives very simply, hates interviews, and does not own a smartphone. And, despite his friendship with Gates, Smil hasn\u2019t done anything to, as marketers would say, to \u201cleverage the relationship\u201d:\nIn economics, there\u2019s something called Campbell\u2019s law. The basic idea is that, when you reward people for a particular measure \u2014 clicks, dollars, likes, etc. \u2014 people will find a way to \u201cgame\u201d the system.\nThe classic example of this happened in India. The government offered rewards to people who caught and killed snakes. Unexpected result: People started to breed more snakes in order to get the rewards.\nIf college admissions require essays, rich parents will pay essay-writers to write those essays. If journalism is fueled by clicks, journalists are going to write sensationalist clickbait. Of course, scientists and academics are in no way exempt.\nThis is the danger of getting paid for your ideas: It\u2019s easy to sell out or self-censor because you\u2019re afraid of (a) financial or (b) status pushback.\nThe cure \u2014 as far as I can tell \u2014 is to hold fame and financial success in low regard. In fact, it might actually help to look down on people who are interested in getting rich and getting ahead.\nI don\u2019t know if Smil does this intentionally, but his intense privacy and frugal lifestyle seem to me like signs that he is trying to protect his ability to think clearly.\nLately, I am trying to modify my life in the same way. Until recently, I accepted monthly contributions of $100 on my Patreon page in exchange for a monthly phone call. The money was nice, but I started to feel pressured to cater to these donors. It found it hard to disagree with them or write things that they might not like.\nY Combinator\u2019s Paul Graham has an excellent essay titled Keep Your Identity Small. The key idea is that the more a particular issue is wrapped up in your identity, the harder it is for you to think clearly about it.\nIt gets worse. When people are exposed to evidence that contradicts their identities or tribal affiliations, they\u2019ll actually double down and become more confident in whatever they believed. This is why it\u2019s important, when trying to think clearly, to avoid identifying with any particular tribe.\nTake dietary advice. I find it hilarious how the paleo, primal, keto, vegan, and vegetarian diet camps are always quibbling about minor things when they share so many similarities (avoid processed foods, eat vegetables, etc.).\nSmil has a book titled Should We Eat Meat? . In it, he refuses to identify with any tribe and instead says that (a) it\u2019s fine to eat meat but (b) we shouldn\u2019t eat too much of it.\nHere he is in an interview:\nHumans are tribal creatures, and I don\u2019t think we can fully escape the need to identify with a group.\nIf you have to choose a group, though, I think the best thing to do is what Annie Duke suggests in her book Thinking in Bets: Identify with a group that values the truth.\nI\u2019m not sure how related this is to \u201cclear thinking\u201d, but another thing I find inspirational about Smil is how he lives in accordance with the advice that he gives.\nSome examples:\nI suppose it\u2019s like that old saying of how chefs should eat their own cooking and architects should live in the houses they build. If you\u2019re going to give advice, then you better make sure you live by it.\nSomehow, I don\u2019t think that Smil would be happy to know that I wrote this essay. I probably got some things wrong, and maybe he doesn\u2019t see things the way that I see them.\nStill, I think that this was worth writing. Reading about Smil has encouraged me to re-organize my life. Perhaps it provides some hints for you as well.\nFor more photos of superheroes, join 25,000+ readers of The Polymath Project Newsletter.

In my last article I wondered if we had seen the bottom and concuded that bitcoin could have reasonably seen the bottom and that one of the first indicators would be breaking a bearish triangle to the upside (it was actually a bear flag at the time). Obviously that happened by now.\nI also mentioned that I would be looking for confirmation of that move and that there is no need to FOMO if it happens. That part is the real reason I am writing this short update.\nBitcoin charts \u2014 the current situation\nBitcoin first broke the large triangle that everyone was talking about for a good six months (blue above), when it finally tumbled through $5,800/$6,000 late in 2018. It then consolidated, broke a bear flag (which I called a triangle in my article linked above) sideways (not to the upside) and formed a larger triangle (red above). That was finally broken a few weeks ago with a strong move up that saw very healthy volume as well (if it is not fake).\nMy read on the current situation is that it is very likely to be a re-test of the $5,800/$6,000 break-down level from the blue triangle. As with almost every break-out, people usually do not need to chase it as price has a tendency to come back (close) to it. So in my opinion, the current move, including the red triangle is most likely a consolidation from the stark fall after price broke the blue triangle. Bitcoin reached as high as $5,477 in this last push up, which is high enough for me to consider the re-test complete, however it is entirely possible that the price first re-visits the $6,000 area directly. I personally am not in a hurry to chase any of these moves.\nPurely from a technical perspective, we are in the process of building out a potential bottom. There are two possible routes that I can see from here.\nLikely price development routes from here\nIn this scenario, Bitcoin continues to rise up to $6,000 and either \u201corganic\u201d demand (chuckle) or the folks at tether push the price so far above $6,000 that not only are most short stops (that I suspect are placed around there) being run, but also when the price finally calms down the $6k level actually functions as support. If that support holds, I would personally be happy to be exposed to bitcoin again for part of my portfolio. Note that this would again be after the re-test (of $6,000). I would not FOMO into any move that goes through that level at first as it may well fall back below.\nIn this scenario, bitcoin ends the current wave up somewhere between now ($5,300) and $6,400 and then falls back to re-test the red triangle break out. This is likely to co-incide with numerous \u201cgolden crosses\u201d in the moving averages (when a short-term moving average crosses above a long-term one) and these are considered good long opportunities. If the triangle break-out level (broadly speaking the area between $3,800 and $4,300 or close to it) is able to sustain the fall, I would consider the re-test to be successful. In my view, it would be very likely for bitcoin to break $6,000 sustainably afterwards. It would represent the strongest of the scenarios presented here in my view.\nThis is practically the same as B1, with one exception. The area around the red triangle break out fails to sustain the price and only causes a small bounce that is sold again. If this comes to pass, unless the fall is extremely rapid from $4,000 to $3,000 (in which case it may form a V-bottom and in tandem with the first fall to that area, an \u201cAdam and Eve\u201d bottom), I expect the bear market to last much longer and go much deeper. I do not see it as likely that the December 2018 low will be able to keep the price from eventually falling as low as $1,000-$1,400.\nAdditional Considerations\nWhere does this leave us?\nAs I said before, we are currently in the process of building out a bottom in bitcoin prices. While a bottom forms, it can still fail and it often does.\nMost price break-outs in most asset classes do not need to be chased to get a similarly good return at the end or at least a much higher certainty of not losig money. I am currently watching if either (a) bitcoin flips $6k from resistance to support and successfully tests it or (b) bitcoin successfully re-tests the $4,000 break out area from the red triangle and manages to put in a higher low after that before I give any consideration to being long.\nMy bias remains short and I am expecting both (a) and (b) to ultimately fail, but that is simply my bias. I will have absolutely no reservations to act against this bias if one of the two occurs. The main point of this article is \u2014 there is no reason to FOMO. It is almost always the wrong move and anyone who wants to can simply watch what happens regarding (a) and (b) now.\nNone of what I write is investment advice. It is always personal opinion.\n\u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014\nThank you for reading. If you enjoyed this, please clap and have a look if you\u2019d like to follow me on twitter. My other works can be found here:\nLastly, the all important disclaimer: this is my personal opinion, not my professional advice. Most of all this is not investment advice in any way. Crypto assets can fluctuate widely in value and all of your capital can be lost. I have a 50/50 chance of being right. Any negative views expressed are solely aimed at the token in question, never at the development teams behind them for which I have utmost respect (if they are sincere).\n", "link": "https://medium.com/@dennyk/bitcoin-price-bottom-searching-continues-a33b955e9587", "author": "DK", "comments": ["Dear DK,As one ages, realization that sometimes there\u2019s nothing to add other than a nod when one agrees pretty much fully kicks in.

This will help as it will make the code we write much clearer.\nWe have 4 smaller screens/boxes inside the main component (the .container):\nAlso, at one moment in time you can see either:\nIn the overlay panels, we have some text and a button. By clicking it you will bring up the other combination of screens and vice-versa. Check the GIF above one more time to see what I mean.\nThis is where it might be a little trickier, but I\u2019ll do my best to explain so you can understand the logic behind it.\nWe have the following layers for the overlay component:\nThe overlay-container \u2014 this will display the visible area (more on this below) at a certain moment in time. It has a width of 50% of the total container's width.\nThe overlay \u2014 this div has a double width size (200%) so it's taking the full width of the main container. (200% * 50%= 100%. The 50% is from the .overlay-container above).\nThe overlay-panels \u2014 are the divs which are holding the actual content (the text and the button) we see on the screen. They both have a position of absolute. We can position them wherever we want in the .overlay component. One of the panels is positioned to the left and the other one is positioned to the right. Both having a width of 50% of the .overlay component.\n\u201cWhy do we need 3 layers?\u201d you might ask... Well, let\u2019s see how it would look like without the first layer:\nIn the picture above you can see that both of the panels are \u201cvisible\u201d, which is not what we want. This is why we\u2019re adding the .overlay-container to act like a \u201cfocus area\u201d. This allows us to hide the panel which is overflowing, or which is out of its boundaries. This is why we needed the .overlay to be twice as big as the .overlay-container. By moving around the .overlay-container, which also has a position of absolute, we can hide or show which panel we want.\nIt was a little bit confusing \ud83d\ude05, I\u2019ll admit, but I hope I made it clearer.\nThese aren\u2019t difficult to understand at all. Basically, we have again two containers \u2014 the .form-containers. Each has a width of 50% and a position - absolute. We move both of them at the same time from left to right. When they get behind the .overlay-container from above (while these are moving) we quickly change the z-index value. The Sign Up form (for example) will move on top of the Sign In form, and vice-versa. Magic to the eyes, but some code logic behind! \ud83d\ude06\nNow that we have broken down the core \u201cfunctionality\u201d of the animation, it\u2019s time to see the actual HTML code. Let\u2019s start with the basic skeleton:\nThe main div has a class of .container and also an id of container because we want to target this element in the JavaScript (more on this below). \ud83d\ude09\nWe also have a few classes on each div:\nThis way we avoid having to write the same CSS code twice and we use the power of being able to add multiple classes.\nYou might have also noticed that the i tags have some classes. These are because we are using FontAwesome for the icons. Read more about them on their website.\nSame as above, we have a common class .overlay-panel and two different classes: .overlay-left and .overlay-right. Also, we have ids for the buttons as we're going to add an onClick eventListener for both of them in the JavaScript.\nUsually, we cover the CSS before the JS part, but this time it is easier to show and explain the JavaScript code first. It will help you understand the CSS we\u2019re going to have later on.\nAs explained above, we add the event listeners. When the buttons are clicked we add or remove the .right-panel-active class (not the best name for the class, but it\u2019s the best I got at the moment \ud83d\ude06). This class will be used to style the subcomponents differently as we have two screens.\nFirst, we have the base CSS for the basic components:\nFew things to note here:\nThe .container CSS:\nNow for the fun part, the .form-container and related styles:\nNote the following:\nAnd finally, the .overlay-container and related styles:\nOther than that... Nothing! We covered everything. We\u2019re done! \ud83d\udc4f\nThis post was a little tough on animations, wasn\u2019t it? \ud83d\ude05 Nevertheless, I hope you\u2019ve learned something from it.\nDon\u2019t forget that you can participate too in the Weekly Coding Challenge by creating your own version of the Sign in/up Form. Share it with me on Twitter: @florinpop1705 so I can see it!\nAlso, you can suggest what we should build for the next Challenge in this Google Form.\nYou can find the live version of the project we\u2019ve built on Codepen.\nThank you for spending your time reading this \ud83d\ude4f, I hope that you learned something new!\nOriginally published at www.florin-pop.com.\n", "link": "https://medium.freecodecamp.org/how-to-build-a-double-slider-sign-in-and-sign-up-form-6a5d03612a34", "author": "Florin Pop", "comments": ["Thank you for sharing!

Often, too much of it. Have you been on a mobile page that looked like it had loaded only to tap on a link or tried to scroll and nothing happens?\nByte-for-byte, JavaScript is still the most expensive resource we send to mobile phones, because it can delay interactivity in large ways.\nToday we\u2019ll cover some strategies you can use to deliver JavaScript efficiently while still giving users a valuable experience.\nWhen users access your site you\u2019re probably sending down a lot of files, many of which are scripts. From a web browsers\u2019 perspective this looks a little bit like this:\nAs much as I love JavaScript, it\u2019s always the most expensive part of your site. I\u2019d like to explain why this can be a major issue.\nThe median webpage today currently ships about 350 KB of minified and compressed JavaScript. Uncompressed, that bloats up to over 1MB of script a browser needs to process.\nNote: Unsure if your JavaScript bundles are delaying how quickly users interact with your site? Check out Lighthouse.\nExperiences that ship down this much JavaScript take more than 14+ seconds to load and get interactive on mobile devices.\nA large factor of this is how long it takes to download code on a mobile network and then process it on a mobile CPU.\nLet\u2019s look at mobile networks.\nThis chart from OpenSignal shows how consistently 4G networks are globally available and the average connection speed users in each country experience. As we can see, many countries still experience lower connection speeds than we may think.\nNot only can that 350 KB of script for a median website from earlier take a while to download, the reality is if we look at popular sites, they actually ship down a lot more script than this:\nWe\u2019re hitting this ceiling across both desktop and mobile web, where sites are sometimes shipping multiple megabytes-worth of code that a browser then needs to process. The question to ask is, can you afford this much JavaScript?\nNote: If you\u2019re sending too much script, consider code-splitting to break up bundles or reducing JS payloads using tree-shaking.\nSites today will often send the following in their JS bundles:\nThis code adds up. The more there is, the longer it will take for a page to load.\nLoading a web page is like a film strip that has three key moments.\nThere\u2019s: Is it happening? Is it useful? And, is it usable?\nIs it happening is the moment you\u2019re able to deliver some content to the screen. (has the navigation started? has the server started responding?)\nIs it useful is the moment when you\u2019ve painted text or content that allows the user to derive value from the experience and engage with it.\nAnd then is it usable is the moment when a user can start meaningfully interacting with the experience and have something happen.\nI mentioned this term \u201c\u2018interactive\u201d earlier, but what does that mean?\nFor a page to be interactive, it must be capable of responding quickly to user input. A small JavaScript payload can ensure this happens fast.\nWhether a user clicks on a link, or scrolls through a page, they need to see that something is actually happening in response to their actions. An experience that can\u2019t deliver on this will frustrate your users.\nOne place this commonly happens is when folks server-side render an experience, and then ship a bunch of JavaScript down afterward to \u201chydrate\u201d the interface (attaching event handlers and extra behaviors).\nWhen a browser runs many of the events you\u2019re probably going to need, it\u2019s likely going to do it on the same thread that handles user input. This thread is called the main thread.\nLoading too much JavaScript into the main thread (via <script>, etc) is the issue. Pulling JS into a Web Worker or caching via a Service Worker doesn\u2019t have the same negative Time-to-Interactive impact.\nAvoid blocking the main thread as much as possible. For more, see \u201cWhy web developers need to care about interactivity\u201d\nWe\u2019re seeing teams we partner with suffer JavaScript impacting interactivity across many types of sites.\nToo much (main thread) JavaScript can delay interactivity for visible elements. This can be a challenge for many companies.\nAbove are a few examples from Google Search where you could start tapping around the UI, but if a site is shipping too much JavaScript down, there could be a delay before something actually happens. This can leave the user feeling a bit frustrated. Ideally, we want all experiences to get interactive as soon as possible.\nMeasuring the Time-to-Interactive of Google News on mobile, we observe large variance between a high-end getting interactive in ~7s vs. a low-end device getting interactive in 55s. So, what is a good target for interactivity?\nWhen it comes to Time to Interactive, we feel your baseline should be getting interactive in under five seconds on a slow 3G connection on a median mobile device. \u201cBut, my users are all on fast networks and high-end phones!\u201d ...are they? You may be on \u201cfast\u201d coffee-shop WiFi but effectively only getting 2G or 3G speeds. Variability matters.\nWho has shipped less JavaScript and reduced their Time-to-Interactive?\nLet\u2019s design for a more resilient mobile web that doesn\u2019t rely as heavily on large JavaScript payloads.\nInteractivity impacts a lot of things. It can be impacted by a person loading your website on a mobile data plan, or coffee shop WiFi, or just them being on the go with intermittent connectivity.\nWhen this happens, and you have a lot of JavaScript that needs to be processed, users can end up waiting for the site to actually render anything. Or, if something does render, they can be waiting a long time before they can interact with anything on the page. Ideally, shipping less JavaScript would alleviate these issues.\nTo explain how JavaScript can have such a large cost, I\u2019d like to walk you through what happens when you send content to a browser. A user types a URL into the browser\u2019s address bar:\nA request is sent to a server which then returns some markup. The browser then parses that markup and discovers the necessary CSS, JavaScript, and images. Then, the browser has to fetch and process all of those resources.\nThe above scenario is an accurate depiction of what happens in Chrome when it processes everything that you send down (yes, it\u2019s a giant emoji factory).\nOne of the challenges here is that JavaScript ends up being a bottleneck. Ideally, we want to be able to paint pixels quickly, and then have the page interactive. But if JavaScript is a bottleneck, you can end up just looking at something that you can\u2019t actually interact with.\nWe want to prevent JavaScript from being a bottleneck to modern experiences.\nOne thing to keep in mind as an industry is that, if we want to be fast at JavaScript, we have to download it, parse it, compile it, and execute it quickly.\nThat means we have to be fast at the network transmission and the processing side of things for our scripts.\nIf you spend a long time parsing and compiling script in a JavaScript engine, that delays how soon a user can interact with your experience.\nTo provide some data about this, here\u2019s a breakdown of where V8 (Chrome\u2019s JavaScript engine) spends its time while it processes a page containing script:\nThe orange represents all the time spent parsing JavaScript that popular sites are sending down. In yellow, is the time spent compiling. Together, these take anywhere up to 30% of the time it takes to process the JavaScript for your page \u2014 this is a real cost.\nAs of Chrome 66, V8 compiles code on a background thread, reducing compile time by up to 20%. But parse and compile are still very costly and it\u2019s rare to see a large script actually execute in under 50ms, even if compiled off-thread.\nAnother thing to keep in mind with JavaScript is that all bytes are not equal. A 200 KB script and a 200 KB image have very different costs.\nThey might take the same amount of time to download, but when it comes to processing we\u2019re dealing with very different costs.\nA JPEG image needs to be decoded, rasterized, and painted on the screen. A JavaScript bundle needs to be downloaded and then parsed, compiled, executed \u2014and there are a number of other steps that an engine needs to complete. Just be aware that these costs are not quite equivalent.\nOne of the reasons why they start to add up and matter is mobile.\nIf we\u2019re fortunate, we may have a high-end or median end phone. The reality is that not all users will have those devices.\nThey may be on a low-end or median phone, and the disparity between these multiple classes of devices can be quite stark due too; thermal throttling, difference in cache sizes, CPU, GPU \u2014 you can end up experiencing quite different processing times for resources like JavaScript, depending on the device you\u2019re using. Your users on low-end phones may even be in the U.S.\nHere\u2019s a breakdown of how long it takes to parse JavaScript across a spectrum of hardware available in 2018:\nAt the top we have high-end devices, like the iPhone 8, which process script relatively quickly. Lower down we have more average phones like the Moto G4 and the <$100 Alcatel 1X. Notice the difference in processing times?\nAndroid phones are getting cheaper, not faster, over time. These devices are frequently CPU poor with tiny L2/L3 cache sizes. You are failing your average users if you\u2019re expecting them to all have high-end hardware.\nLet\u2019s look at a more practical version of this problem using script from a real-world site. Here\u2019s the JS processing time for CNN.com:\nOn an iPhone 8 (using the A11 chip) it takes nine seconds less to process CNN\u2019s JavaScript than it does on an average phone. That\u2019s nine seconds quicker that experience could get interactive.\nNow that WebPageTest supports the Alcatel 1X (~$100 phone sold in the U.S, sold out at launch) we can also look at filmstrips for CNN loading on mid-lower end hardware. Slow doesn\u2019t even begin to describe this:\nThis hints that maybe we need to stop taking fast networks and fast devices for granted.\nSome users are not going to be on a fast network or have the latest and greatest phone, so it\u2019s vital that we start testing on real phones and real networks . Variability is a real issue.\n\u201cVariability is what kills the User Experience\u201d \u2014 Ilya Grigorik. Fast devices can actually sometimes be slow. Fast networks can be slow, variability can end up making absolutely everything slow.\nWhen variance can kill the user experience, developing with a slow baseline ensures everyone (both on fast and slow setups) benefits. If your team can take a look at their analytics and understand exactly what devices your users are actually accessing your site with, that\u2019ll give you a hint at what devices you should probably have in the office to test your site with.\nwebpagetest.org/easy has a number of Moto G4 preconfigured under the \u201cMobile\u201d profiles. This is valuable in case you\u2019re unable to purchase your own set of median-class hardware for testing.\nThere\u2019s a number of profiles set up there that you can use today that already have popular devices pre-configured. For example, we\u2019ve got some median mobile devices like the Moto G4 ready for testing.\nIt\u2019s also important to test on representative networks. Although I\u2019ve talked about how important low end and median phones are, Brian Holt made this great point: it\u2019s really important to know your audience.\nNot every site needs to perform well on 2G on a low-end phone. That said, aiming for a high level of performance across the entire spectrum is not a bad thing to do.\nYou may have a wide range of users on the higher end of the spectrum, or in a different part of the spectrum. Just be aware of the data behind your sites, so that you can make a reasonable call on how much all of this matters.\nIf you want JavaScript to be fast, pay attention to download times for low end networks. The improvements you can make there are: ship less code, minify your source, take advantage of compression (i.e., gzip, Brotli, and Zopfli).\nTake advantage of caching for repeat visits. Parse time is critical for phones with slow CPUs.\nIf you\u2019re a back-end or full stack developer, you know that you kind of get what you pay for with respect to CPU, disk, and network.\nAs we build sites that are increasingly more reliant on JavaScript, we sometimes pay for what we send down in ways that we don\u2019t always easily see.\nThe shape of success is whatever let\u2019s us send the least amount of script to users while still giving them a useful experience. Code-splitting is one option that makes this possible.\nCode-splitting is this idea that, instead of shipping down your users a massive monolithic JavaScript bundle \u2014 sort of like a massive full pizza \u2014 what if you were to just send them one slice at a time? Just enough script needed to make the current page usable.\nCode-splitting can be done at the page level, route level, or component level. It\u2019s something that\u2019s well supported by many modern libraries and frameworks through bundlers like webpack and Parcel. Guides to accomplish this are available for React, Vue.js and Angular.\nMany large teams have seen big wins off the back of investing in code-splitting recently.\nIn an effort to rewrite their mobile web experiences to try to make sure users were able to interact with their sites as soon as possible, both Twitter and Tinder saw anywhere up to a 50% improvement in their Time to Interactive when they adopted aggressive code splitting.\nStacks like Gatsby.js (React), Preact CLI, and PWA Starter Kit attempt to enforce good defaults for loading & getting interactive quickly on average mobile hardware.\nAnother thing many of these sites have done is adopted auditing as part of their workflow.\nThankfully, the JavaScript ecosystem has a number of great tools to help with bundle analysis.\nTools like Webpack Bundle Analyzer, Source Map Explorer and Bundle Buddy allow you to audit your bundles for opportunities to trim them down.\nThese tools visualize the content of your JavaScript bundles: they highlight large libraries, duplicate code, and dependencies you may not need.\nBundle auditing often highlights opportunities to swap heavy dependencies (like Moment.js and its locales) for lighter alternatives (such as date-fns).\nIf you use webpack, you may find our repository of common library issues in bundles useful.\nIf you\u2019re unsure whether you have any issues with JavaScript performance in general, check out Lighthouse:\nLighthouse is a tool baked into the Chrome Developer Tools. It\u2019s also available as a Chrome extension. It gives you an in-depth performance analysis that highlights opportunities to improve performance.\nWe\u2019ve recently added support for flagging high \u201cJavaScript boot-up time\u201d to Lighthouse. This audit highlights scripts which might be spending a long time parsing/compiling, which delays interactivity. You can look at this audit as opportunities to either split up those scripts, or just be doing less work there.\nAnother thing you can do is make sure you\u2019re not shipping unused code down to your users:\nCode coverage is a feature in DevTools that allows you to discover unused JavaScript (and CSS) in your pages. Load up a page in DevTools and the coverage tab will display how much code was executed vs. how much was loaded. You can improve the performance of your pages by only shipping the code a user needs.\nTip: With coverage recording, you can interact with your app and DevTools will update how much of your bundles were used.\nThis can be valuable for identifying opportunities to split up scripts and defer the loading of non-critical ones until they\u2019re needed.\nIf you\u2019re looking for a pattern for serving JavaScript efficiently to your users, check out the PRPL pattern.\nPRPL (Push, Render, Precache and Lazy-Load) is a pattern for aggressively splitting code for every single route, then taking advantage of a service worker to pre-cache the JavaScript and logic needed for future routes, and lazy load it as needed.\nWhat this means is that when a user navigates to other views in the experience, there\u2019s a good chance it\u2019s already in the browser cache, and so they experience much more reduced costs in terms of booting scripts up and getting interactive.\nIf you care about performance or you\u2019ve ever worked on a performance patch for your site, you know that sometimes you could end up working on a fix, only to come back a few weeks later and find someone on your team was working on a feature and unintentionally broke the experience. It goes a little like this:\nThankfully, there are ways we can we can try to work around this, and one way is having a performance budget in place.\nPerformance budgets are critical because they keep everybody on the same page. They create a culture of shared enthusiasm for constantly improving the user experience and team accountability.\nBudgets define measurable constraints to allow a team to meet their performance goals. As you have to live within the constraints of budgets, performance is a consideration at each step, as opposed to an after-thought.\nBased on the work by Tim Kadlec, metrics for perf budgets can include:\nAlex Russell had a tweet-storm about performance budgets with a few salient points worth noting:\nEveryone who impacts the user-experience of a site has a relationship to how it performs.\nPerformance is more often a cultural challenge than a technical one.\nDiscuss performance during planning sessions and other get-togethers. Ask business stakeholders what their performance expectations are. Do they understand how perf can impact the business metrics they care about? Ask eng. teams how they plan to address perf bottlenecks. While the answers here can be unsatisfactory, they get the conversation started.\nHere\u2019s an action plan for performance:- Create your performance vision. This is a one-page agreement on what business stakeholders and developers consider \u201cgood performance\u201d- Set your performance budgets. Extract key performance indicators (KPIs) from the vision and set realistic, measurable targets from them. e.g. \u201cLoad and get interactive in 5s\u201d. Size budgets can fall out of this. e.g \u201cKeep JS < 170KB minified/compressed\u201d- Create regular reports on KPIs. This can be a regular report sent out to the business highlighting progress and success.\nWeb Performance Warrior by Andy Still and Designing for Performance by Lara Hogan are both excellent books that discuss how to think about getting a performance culture in place.\nWhat about tooling for perf budgets? You can setup Lighthouse scoring budgets in continuous integration with the Lighthouse CI project:\nA number of performance monitoring services support setting perf budgets and budget alerts including Calibre, Treo, Webdash and SpeedCurve:\nEmbracing performance budgets encourages teams to think seriously about the consequences of any decisions they make from early on in the design phases right through to the end of a milestone.\nLooking for further reference? The U.S Digital Service document their approach to tracking performance with Lighthouse by setting goals and budgets for metrics like Time-to-Interactive.\nNext up..\nEach site should have access to both lab and field performance data.\nTo track the impact JavaScript can have on user-experience in a RUM (Real User Monitoring) setting, there are two things coming to the web I\u2019d recommend checking out.\nThe first is Long Tasks \u2014 an API enabling you to gather real-world telemetry on tasks (and their attributed scripts) that last longer than 50 milliseconds that could block the main thread. You can record these tasks and log them back to your analytics.\nFirst Input Delay (FID) is a metric that measures the time from when a user first interacts with your site (i.e. when they tap a button) to the time when the browser is actually able to respond to that interaction. FID is still an early metric, but we have a polyfill available for it today that you can check out.\nBetween these two, you should be able to get enough telemetry from real users to see what JavaScript performance problems they\u2019re running into.\nIt\u2019s well known that third-party JavaScript can have a dire impact on page load performance. While this remains true, it\u2019s important to acknowledge that many of today\u2019s experiences ship a lot of first-party JavaScript of their own, too. If we\u2019re to load fast, we need to chip away at the impact both sides of this problem can have on the user experience.\nThere are several common slip-ups we see here, including teams using blocking JavaScript in the document head to decide what A/B test to show users. Or, shipping the JS for all variants of an A/B test down, even if only one is going to actually be used \ud83e\udd2f\nWe have a separate guide on loading Third-party JavaScript if this is currently the primary bottleneck you\u2019re experiencing.\nPerformance is a journey. Many small changes can lead to big gains.\nEnable users to interact with your site with the least amount of friction. Run the smallest amount of JavaScript to deliver real value. This can mean taking incremental steps to get there.\nIn the end, your users will thank you.\nReferences\nWith great thanks to Thomas Steiner, Alex Russell, Jeremy Wagner, Patrick Hulce, Tom Ankers and Houssein Djirdeh for their contributions to this write-up.

Since this material appeared to be quite informative and guide-alike, I decided to share it.\nSo, you know that design defines the success of most software products. And software development discovers new ways to use the design for various products. I talk about design for websites and applications. There is no great app without stylish elements and usability. The effectiveness of the application is measured by the optimum combination of functionality and attractiveness. Visual communication must be simple, intuitive and engaging.\nDesigning applications and websites pose special challenges:\nBut that worth it! Because an effective design and implementation of applications can have profound, positive implications for productivity, efficiency, accuracy, and satisfaction in a huge range of environments \u2014 from entertainment to healthcare.\nYou could have heard about UI or UX design before but never actually had a chance to get what, where and why it is used for. And no, UI and UX are not the same things. Read about principle differences between UI and UX before you went further. UX is the overall experience a user has with the product, and UI is the things the user will actually interact with and see.\nThe key to successful application design is not a good idea or a good feature \u2014 it all comes down to the user experience (UX) and the user interface (UI). It doesn\u2019t matter how great your idea is if the app is looking horrible and impossible to use easily.\nIf you\u2019re developing a web or mobile application, one of the major things you need to get right is the way your app looks and feels. For example, if your field is eCommerce, a poorly designed app will lose you many potential customers.\nFor example, what does your application user see first when opening your app? The first thing your user sees is the landing page. What is a landing page? This is a start point from which the user understands if the application or a site will meet his/her requirements and fulfill the needs. It must be attractive and contain some call-to-action buttons for the user to know what to do next.\nTo add the value to the work of UI and UX designers, here you can find some interesting UI vs UX comparison:\nSometimes UI and UX designer is the same person who is in charge of the whole design process. But let\u2019s discuss each type of design separately.\nUX (User Experience) design is the process of creating products, systems or services that provide meaningful and relevant experiences to users. This involves the design of the entire process of acquiring and integrating the product, including aspects of branding, design, usability, and function. It also includes the meaningful and valuable aspects of human-computer interaction and product ownership. UX handles the architecture of the content and the sitemap.\nAs a spoiler, I\u2019d like to say that UI (User Interface) design, we\u2019ll talk about in the next part, is an important aspect of UX design, it is a subset of it. Because UX design covers a vast array of other areas. Information Architecture (IA) is the second most viable aspect of UX design.\nUX design helps users accomplish goals. It is not focused only on creating products that are usable, it also covers the other aspects of the user experience, such as:\nSo far, the good user experience is one that meets a particular user\u2019s needs in the specific context where the target audience use the product. UX design is user-centered \u2014 the type of user defines the type of design.\nThat is why UX design is dynamic and constantly modified over time due to changing usage circumstances and changes to individual systems, usage context in which they can be found and so on. Here you can find some UX design trends that are expected in 2019. Also, we can say that user experience is about user-product interaction and experiences.\nThe main task of UX design is to create products which can be tailored to meet a user\u2019s specific needs, but which provides functionality that is predictable. In other words, UX Design is to study user behavior and understand user motivations with the goal to design better digital experiences.\nLet\u2019s talk about the main requirements for the UX design. What should be the perfect User Experience design? The answer to this question can be presented as the list of UX design requirements which should be meet on different levels. These levels form the UX design pyramid.\nThe goals on each level of the UX design pyramid could be reached through following the main UX design principles:\nUX design balances business, people and technology. While it is true that a product cannot succeed without a healthy business, a business cannot succeed without a happy customer \u2014 and it is the UX Designer\u2019s job to make the customer happy.\nSo, there are many things involved in UX design. The full UX design stack consists of:\nBut UI part is not going first. UX design begins with the identification of a problem through user research. There is no point in solving problems that users don\u2019t care about.\nIn a nutshell, UX design process steps are the next:\nBelow you can find an overview of the main UX design process approaches.\nUX design process can be described within several most popular UX design approaches.\nCurrently, there are three well-known UX design process approaches:\nA classic UX design process is usually taught in colleges and is built using the waterfall methodology. Here is the Classic UX design process:\nPut it simply, as a scheme for describing a classic UX design process you can imagine something like this:\nBut there\u2019s also the other approach to UX design process appeared in 2013 because the classic UX design process was incompatible with Agile development. The new design process called Lean UX and allowed UX to operate inside of Agile\u2019s cone of uncertainty and rapidly update designs based on user feedback. It brought experience design back into harmony with product development.\nIn a nutshell, Lean UX is a set of principles based on the agile methods of the \u2018Lean Startup\u2019, where the focus is brought to the present. Instead of throwing design deliverables over the wall, teams accept that a final design can\u2019t be created up front, and believe the answers will emerge as hypotheses are tested with MVP (Minimal Viable Product) development. Lean UX design process can be described as \u2018build, measure and learn\u2019 loop, or a \u2018think, make, check\u2019 cycle.\nLater on, Lean UX design process appeared to be inefficient when a product plan wasn\u2019t well defined, resulting in significant waste and rework.\nAnother great design process was suggested by Google Ventures. This was Design Sprint. It allowed teams to rapidly define and test low-fidelity prototypes. The Design Sprint by Google Ventures can be seen as a combination of the three approaches: Design Thinking, Agile, and Lean. A key component of the sprint is the creation of a prototype, which is one of the best ways to gather data and test ideas out. The schema could be presented the next way:\nAll the UX design process approaches are based on the same iterations but answer different questions. Read more about how all of the approaches different and what do they have in common in my article Agile UX vs. Lean UX!\nTo sum up, I\u2019ll cover some more information on each part of what UX design does:\nBut this is not the whole list of the things UX design include. Find the Key parts of user experience design with their real essence!\nThis is UX design to decide whether users will turn pages or scroll the content. And to take such responsibility on details and predict their impact UX designers should know a lot about human behavior. UX designers usually come from a variety of backgrounds such as visual design, programming, psychology, and interaction design. Later on, I\u2019ll also talk about UX designers main tasks in details.\nLet\u2019s start with the definition of what an interface is. An interface is a mechanism of the interaction of the two systems. From this point, a User Interface is an interface created for facilitating direct interaction between a system and a user.\nOn the display device, there are two common types of user interfaces:\nIn this material, I will stick particularly to the type of user interface that is responsible for visual perception \u2014 GUI.\nUI or User Interface design is a discipline of designing user interfaces for machines and software, such as computers, home appliances, mobile devices, and other electronic devices, with the focus on responsiveness and aesthetics, maximizing usability to foster a good user experience. As a part of UX, UI design focuses more on colors and typography. In a nutshell, UI design is typically a combination of:\nAs an example, UX design is focused on where to put the button for the user to find it easily, whereas UI design will think on how to make this button nice-looking to make the user want to press it.\nWhy do we need a user interface? The product must be visually appealing and beautiful. UI design crafts a common visual language and hierarchy that enhances how users engage with your product.\nUI brings together concepts from Interaction Design, Visual Design, and Information Architecture.\nUser interface elements include buttons, text fields, checkboxes, sliders, icons, tags, message boxes, pagination etc. To understand better what UI design is, you should take a small tour on the main UI design elements.\nAn appealing user interface design can\u2019t be developed without the using of all the techniques from the next fields:\nAdditionally, nowadays UI design largely depends on motion design which creates instant user feedback crucial for any user interface. Animations, visual effects, and screen transitions have a tremendous impact on how first-time users will engage with the app. Discover the power of motion design in my blog article.\nAs I mentioned before, prototypes are different from wireframes and from mockups. I previously added prototypes to UX design, but as far as they are usually used for users to test product, prototypes must be high fidelity, interactive and fit the final user interface as much as possible. That is why in the next part I\u2019ll talk of user interface prototypes.\nPrototypes simulate the interaction between the user and interface as realistically as possible.\nThere are 5 common types of UI software prototyping:\nEvery type of prototyping has its own list of digital tools that fit best the process. From Keynote and Google slides to InVision and Adobe XD... Here you can explore the ultimate list of UI prototyping tools used for different types of UI software prototyping.\nWhile creating UI prototype a good designer follows the next 6 User Interface design principles (according to Larry LeRoy Constantine) :\nLet\u2019s talk about how to meet all the main UI design principles that are mentioned above. To do this, designers use some simple yet beneficial UI techniques.\nFirst of all, a user interface technique (interaction technique or input technique) is a combination of hardware and software elements that provide a way for users to accomplish a single task. For example clicking a button, pressing a key, performing a mouse gesture or uttering a speech command.\nIn UI design there are tens of different effective techniques helping the user to accomplish the task. I would like to name the most famous UI techniques.\nThere are more examples, but most of them can be categorized within the groups above.\nAfter you know all the important UI techniques I must warn you about the most annoying ones. Please, consider them in order to save your user from extinction.\nThere are several phases and processes in the user interface design that I can name. Here are some of the most viable ones:\nWhile following the UI design process, don\u2019t forget about the basic rules to create the great User Interface design!\nIn previous sections, I tried to collect, structure, explain and present you all the main terms and nuances of UI and UX design. But you might want to read more about it and here you can find the list of the best books about UI and UX design.\nUX and UI design primarily used to create outstanding websites and designs for mobile applications. Let\u2019s make a brief intro to the web and mobile design.\nPut it simply, web design is a process of creating websites. It involves Information Architecture, website structure, user interface, navigation ergonomics, website layouts, colors, contrasts, fonts and photography or illustrations as well as icons design.\nWeb designer is a specialist who applies UX and UI skills to a web page design. Originally, a web designer is a UI designer (a subset of UI designers) focused on design and building web user interface. Some of them might know a bit of frontend programming such as HTML/CSS, Javascript to show how the design/prototype would work on screen. Also, they should know more about technical restrictions in web, grids and so on.\nA web designer should:\nIcons;Infographics;Logos;Presentations etc.\nUX design for web enhancing user satisfaction by improving the usability, accessibility, and efficiency of user interaction with websites.\nApplication design for mobile (desktop and laptop as well) poses special challenges:\nThe UX/UI Design of the application improves the user experience and customer satisfaction that ultimately helps increase the number of users of the specific application.\nMobile UX design refers to the design of positive experiences during the use of mobile devices and wearables. Depending on the context, mobile app design places unique requirements on the user experience.\nRead about these 8 key principles of mobile UX design that proved their efficiency.\nIn recent years, such requirements were met by following the next mobile app design trends:\nTo understand these trends, I recommend you to read about the key differences between a web application and a website in my material about web app development.Another thing to consider is mobile interface design myths we used to hear sometimes. To be honest, some of these myths could take place in the past, but nowadays mobile experience went much further.\nTo start with basics of what UX designers do, UX designers consider Why, What and How for the use of the product they work on.\nUX designers start with the Why before determining the What and then, finally, How in order to create products that users can form meaningful experiences with. In a web or mobile application design, designers must ensure the product\u2019s \u2018substance\u2019 comes through an existing device and offers a seamless, fluid experience.\nAt What stage, UX designer should answer some fundamental questions like:\nThe main questions for the How stage are different and relate the implementation:\nA UX designer\u2019s typical tasks vary, but often include user research, creating personas, designing wireframes and interactive prototypes as well as testing designs.\nIn simple words, UX designers are involved in conducting extensive user research, formulating an information architecture and creating user profiles and stories. UX designer doesn\u2019t necessarily possess visual or graphic design skill set, however, an understanding of psychology and systemic design is a must.\nUI designers at the same time try to break down complex structures into simple comprehensible formats for the end user\u2019s convenience. Therefore, both UX/UI and web designers work towards providing an enjoyable and effective experience for the user.\nUI/UX designers should be able to understand the need of the users. The objectives and goal of the application are still the first determining factor before they even placed their skills and knowledge in creating web applications, mobile apps, website, and service. Then after understanding the need of the user and the objective of the application, a designer must be able to effectively translate it into functionalities. They must also be able to determine the possible future requirements of the application. In permanent cooperation with other development team members, designers are engaged in the product development stage from the initial phase up to the date of completion. These tasks and obligations make a scope of the main duties of the User Experience designer. But I suggest you read about what UX designers are paid for in details.\nApplying to the company I work in (Syndicode), we simplify the UI/UX design processes a bit. This is explained by the number of projects you work on in parallel. Also, I can say that when the specialist gains a lot of experience, the time for following all the procedure steps is reduced. Skills help you work faster.\nHow it all starts in Syndicode? Firstly, we are having a Discovery Session with a client to find out as much as possible about the project. The main goal of this session is to gather key project information so we could gain a high-level understanding. Then we will create a plan according to which we\u2019ll work on the UI/UX/web/mobile design solutions and agree on every step of it with the client. Then we go through the nessesary steps of UI and UX design processes according to Lean UX.\n", "link": "https://medium.com/swlh/ui-ux-design-guide-with-terms-explanations-tips-and-trends-754b9356d914", "author": "Iren Korkishko", "comments": ["Amazing insights!

Now I\u2019m sure I don\u2019t look half as cool as Brad Pitt saying that but I should get points for trying, no? The statement is clear though: Typography is the premier thing you need to keep in mind at all times.\nNow, keep in mind that when I say design, I mean visual design, more specifically, the things that are relevant to your average non-designer person: Making a little website, a resume, a poster, some social media posts and things of that nature. But just for the purpose of this article, I\u2019m going to focus on user interface design/web design more.\nThe problem with typography is that it\u2019s so subtle that most people don\u2019t seem to pay enough attention to it. However, you could make complete designs with type only if you know what you\u2019re doing.\nLet\u2019s ask ourselves a simple question: What is the purpose of a website or app? Isn\u2019t it to convey certain information? Isn\u2019t it all just a frame to put a bunch of information in? The purpose of UI designers is just to arrange those pieces of information in a way that makes sense.\nMost information in any website or application is text. Take a look at how Slack\u2019s website would look like without Text.\nWe don\u2019t have too many layers to play with when it comes to typography. For pictures, it\u2019s much easier because you have a whole lot of parameters you can play with: Brightness, contrast, saturation, color, exposure and each one of those had endless possibilities. With type, there isn\u2019t a lot to mess with. So it\u2019s both easier and harder. Here are the settings that are at our disposal to format text.\nI\u2019m sure that many wouldn\u2019t think much of these settings. Heck, I know UI designers and front-end developers who have never used any of these parameters (apart from choosing a typeface of course). And yes, you\u2019re right, you don\u2019t absolutely have to. But it gives you an extra layer of refinement that makes your work stand out and look more \u201cprofessional\u201d. I\u2019m going to go into the details of how each of these can help you make better designs.\nPicking a good font for your design is in my opinion, the most \u201cmake or break\u201d step to your design. In that regard, try to keep these things in mind\nHelvetica Neue and Segoe are perfectly fine. But If you\u2019re the kind of person who\u2019s always using Open sans, Roboto, Raleway, Lato, and the rest of the Google fonts gang, you are really missing out. Google Fonts is greatly contributing to this notion that free fonts are just as good as premium fonts with tricky licenses. They\u2019re not. Not by a long shot. Here\u2019s my premium font cheat sheet\nMost of the famous Google fonts are not bad at all. But that\u2019s about the extent of it. Just not bad. A typeface introduces you to a vast dimension of expression that is inaccessible by any other tool or technique. To waste that space by using a standard font when there\u2019s so much that could be said with a beautiful well-crafted one is a true shame. Here\u2019s Spotify\u2019s landing page in its original font and in 3 of the closest Google fonts in my opinion: Open Sans, Work Sans, and Rubik. Could you guess which one is the original?\nIt\u2019s number three. But if you didn\u2019t get it right, it\u2019s no biggy because I think we can all agree that the other ones are pretty close right? True. Pretty close, but that\u2019s it. Circular, which is the original font here, is far superior to all the others. And now that you\u2019ve taken a good glaze, which one would you choose?\nBut it does not just display headers that make the difference. Premium fonts render much better at a small scale, and they conserve their personality much better too. Do you want to try again? I\u2019ve taken the Liberty of remaking the Spotify windows app with Open Sans to show you how much difference it makes.\nAgain, needless to say, the original is the one on the left. It\u2019s probably too obvious because it\u2019s a screenshot and it\u2019s more blurry. Even though the Open Sans version is rendered better, even though I cheated a bit here and there by changing the tracking and colors to match the original, it still pales in comparison. Check out that left Aside. I just couldn\u2019t make it look much better than that (without changing the look too much)\nSome people might tell you that you should use serifs for long bodies of text because they are more \u201clegible\u201d. But the research that initially made that claim has been debunked too many times to count. But still, serifs introduce a lot of character (no pun intended) and sophistication to a website. They have this vintage flare that feels serious, premium, bold, and most of all, intentional. They will also help you stand out of the mold of the sans-serif web epidemy.\nWhen you have a few years of visual design under your belt, this probably comes naturally to you. You probably have your go-to font combinations. But For those of us who didn\u2019t go to design school and learn to match fonts based on the x-height or don\u2019t know what that is, It\u2019s not really that complicated. You can go online and find nice font pairing in websites like Fontpair or of course, the indispensable Typewolf which I still can\u2019t believe is free.\nMy advice to you is to mix styles. You can mix a serif with a sans-serif, maybe a script and a serif, or if you\u2019re feeling a little adventurous, might I suggest a monospace and a sans-serif \ud83d\udc4c\nKnowing which weights to choose for your composition is the first step of making the best of your typeface choice. Here are a few rules\nJust because your font has 20 different weights and styles, doesn\u2019t mean you should use them all. Two or three weights would be enough, one for standard, one for titles, and maybe one for large headers like on hero sections. That should be enough for most cases.\nIf you have many weights to choose from, you might want to skip a weight to emphasize the contrast. For instance, if you chose regular for your paragraphs, you might want to skip medium and try semibold for titles, skip bold and try heavy for headers. Remember, the goal is not how heavy it looks. The goal is how different it is from the other text. If you do everything else right (colors, spacing etc...) you won\u2019t need much else to draw contrast.\nGenerally speaking, I don\u2019t remember many cases where I used Black or hairline for a UI project. Sure, they have their uses. But keep in mind their shortcomings as well. Hairline text, which isn\u2019t available in many fonts to be fair, is not very legible and wouldn\u2019t work for small text. Black can take up so much space and clutter the composition. So stay clear of those two as much as you can. The best use for them is for large display headers\nTracking refers to the space between the glyphs (characters) of a word. It is often confused with Kerning which is the spacing between two individual glyphs, which is something built into the font file itself. If you ask me, this is the most underused parameter of all.\nI used to suffer a lot with choosing fonts before I learned to leverage tracking. Some fonts naturally take too much horizontal space. Consider Poppins for instance, one of my all-time favorite fonts. You just couldn\u2019t use it as much as you\u2019d want to because it took too much space. The solution is to reduce the tracking instead of trying to find another font that wouldn\u2019t necessarily capture the whimsical vibe of Poppins (don\u2019t try it, there isn\u2019t any)\nNotice how we managed to fit in the title and squeeze in 5 extra words by either reducing the tracking or changing the font entirely. The new font, however, doesn\u2019t necessarily capture the entire essence of the original choice. Note also how much sturdier Poppins gets when you tighten up the tracking making it not only take less space but also hold the composition tighter.\nDomain-display gave me a lot of trouble when I tried to use it for headers in an editorial project. It was taking up too much space even after reducing the tracking. Luckily, there was a condensed version of the font that not only reduced the kerning but also made the glyphs themselves more horizontally compact without sacrificing the beautiful structure of the typeface. This reduced the horizontal real-estate needed and allowed me to keep the density that I required.\nI also remember designing an app where I had very little horizontal space to play with. I decided to go with Encode-Sans-Condensed which gave me the possibility to write the information on one line to save space all while remaining fairly readable and aesthetically pleasing.\nThis one is perhaps the most subtle of the parameters, but it can definitely be a lifesaver sometimes. Line spacing comes-in very handy if you\u2019re designing landing pages, blogs, newsfeeds, and any other text-rich design. Before thinking about the nitty-gritty details I\u2019m about to go into, always consider the main point of separating lines: legibility. Hence, the leading shouldn\u2019t necessarily be directly proportional to the text size. The rule of thumb when it comes to leading is that you decrease it for headers and increase it for small text. This is because if your font size is 72pt, the space between the lines is more than necessary to tell them apart, so you can afford to reduce it.\nWe are always trying to strike balance between how much information we want to convey to the user/visitor vs how much they are willing to receive per unit of space. That\u2019s the challenge of information density. Too dense and the interface feels cluttered and busy. Too little and it feels empty and wasteful. Here\u2019s an example that doesn\u2019t involve leading, but perfectly illustrates the concept of information density\nIf you\u2019re going with a very breathable, low-density design with large margins between components, sometimes text blocks can feel \u201cloose\u201d inside the layout. You might remedy that by increasing the leading and thus introduce more breathability into the paragraphs themselves, hence complying with the overall breathability of the design.\nHere\u2019s an example that contrasts the breathable and effortless feeling website of IDEO, the world leading design agency vs the compact, rich and loaded website of Mercedes-Benz, a leader in engineering and manufacturing.\nNotice how the paragraphs on IDEO\u2019s website are more breathable thus complement the overall generous spacing of the composition. Contrast that with Mercedes-Benz\u2019s website where text blocks are slightly tighter thus conveying an image of increased information saturation.\nIf you leverage line spacing correctly, you create an opportunity to use contrast to highlight certain blocks.\nIf you feel just a little nerdier, you can consider anti-aliasing which can be of great importance for digital projects, But that\u2019s a subject for another time. The main takeaway is this: Give typography more attention in all your projects. learning to leverage the few parameters that we have at our disposal will make your designs go from good to great.\nOriginally published at muz.li\n", "link": "https://medium.muz.li/why-ui-design-is-all-about-typography-370250d89ce8", "author": "Ayadi Ghait", "comments": ["Thank you for this article which allowed us to put concrete examples on what needed to be done\u00a0:)", "So true.

Upon reading through all sorts of write-up on them, my response at first was \u201chuh?\u201d A lot of cool technical speak sounded impressive, but until I started tinkering around with them it was hard to see just how exciting they could be.\nSince digging into them I now am of the opinion that with themes, what\u2019s already powerful about Gatsby turns into an even more heavily customizable juggernaut of a tool. This post looks at the advantages of themes from a more beginner, higher-level approach, as well as how a theme can be implemented in a Gatsby site (not how themes are authored, which other resources cover).\nA Gatsby theme is installed as an npm package, but at its core is setup like any other Gatsby site. Essentially, you can convert one Gatsby project into a reusable building block for other Gatsby projects. This flexibility means you can utilize a theme for multiple sites with use cases like:\nThinking of themes as an npm package is useful to understand the power that this abstraction brings to development. Just like package authors of npm can expose more or less of an API to provide greater or less flexibility at different tradeoffs, Gatsby theme authors can provide varying levels of control to users of the theme, providing configuration setup, styling rules, or whole components!\n(Imagine how much time you\u2019ll save when you eliminate all the time you spend debugging how you broke node-sass again.)\nIn the words of Jason Lengstorf in a podcast interview on JavaScript to Elm:\nJust like functions in programming can be composed together like little mathematical nesting dolls, multiple themes can be composed together.\nA theme can be installed in another Gatsby project to make a parent theme, a child theme, or even be composed together horizontally to use multiple themes in a single site. You\u2019re able to install a blog theme that houses all the details for your blog, a separate e-commerce theme that can support checkout, and then a styling theme that lays a skin over all the rest of them.\nThis exact topic is covered in this blog post by Kyle Mathews. To sum up some of his points and further his argument, themes provide a higher-level approach to working with Gatsby that abstract away the complex or repetitive parts into a reusable package.\nA traditional \u201cone-off\u201d Gatsby sites take a broad array of resources and combines them into a site, but each of those resources is handled individually and has to be added one at a time.\nGatsby starters help to reduce that repetition, allowing you to make a boilerplate of each compose-able plugin or setting you wanted. That starter could be cloned right to where you want to start developing, but what happens when you want to update changes to 20 sites you\u2019ve made from the same starter? The starter has basically been \u201cejected\u201d, its git history deleted, and you\u2019re left making updates across 20 different repositories with slightly adjusted implementation details.\nThemes solve that headache by allowing entire sites and configurations to be packaged up together. You can convert a site into a theme and then rather than pulling in and installing each plugin or asset you want each time you create a new site, the theme can be pulled in that handles all of those for you.\nImagine having the ability to maintain your docs in a Gatsby site by (1) installing a theme (2) filling a folder with markdown files and (3) deploying, using the configuration setup by a theme author. (If you like that idea, great! Because we\u2019re going to do it together \ud83d\ude4c)\nThemes are not stamped out, cookie cutter sites cloned into an entirely new repo like a WordPress theme. They are upstream pieces of your application that are consumed by your Gatsby project (potentially, many Gatsby projects).\nSo how do you make themes work? All of this sounds awesome, but so does cooking Baked Alaska, until you realize that the process of cooking involves lighting it on fire.\nUsing themes in Gatsby is a similar process to using plugins in Gatsby, but I\u2019m going to walk through what\u2019s happening at each step to spell out what\u2019s happening as simple as I can make it.\nThis tutorial assumes a general understanding the Gatsby, if you\u2019re unfamiliar with what\u2019s going on you can get up to speed here or send me a message \ud83d\ude42\nI\u2019m beginning with the default Gatsby starter, running this command will generate a new Gatsby site and navigate into it:\nI can then install a theme into a site much like how a Gatsby plugin would be installed. I\u2019m going to install the gatsby-theme-docz theme, which will do the setup around configuring MDX files and generating docs for me.\nNote: MDX is a format that lets you write JSX inside of Markdown files, basically letting us write in markdown as well as including React components alongside it, pretty cool!\nThen I\u2019ll open up my gatsby-config.js file to specify that I want to use themes in my Gatsby project with __experimentalThemes, and include the name of the theme I\u2019m using:\nThemes are exported from the config alongside plugins, metadata, and whatever else you might need to specify here.\nNote: Gatsby themes are still an experimental feature in development, which is why the feature is prefixed with the word experimental\nWith that added, my project now relies on what I\u2019ve defined in my config as well as what is defined in the theme\u2019s config. Now I can start using any of the setup that the theme supplies in my project (in this case, MDX). Adding a new .mdx file to the src/pages directory is enough to let the theme do the heavy lifting of configuring exactly how gatsby-mdx will behave (without me worrying about it).\nI added a file called image.mdx that I\u2019ll use to show off gatsby-image which comes installed with the Gatsby default starter (and gives me speedy, optimized images without any of the pain). Then inside of the file I added, some really simple markdown and JSX:\nThis file shows how powerful MDX can make authoring by allowing components to be imported right into markdown and then included right next to our plain markdown. We\u2019re importing the Image component (that is already a part of the default starter) and using it like it would be written in normal React code.\nNow start up your server by running gatsby develop from the terminal and navigate to http://localhost:8000/image in the browser:\nJust like that, I now have the Docz theme:\nIf I decide that there is a component in an imaginary theme gatsby-theme-abc that I want to use in my project I can import it from its path like this:\nComponents, data, configuration, constants/tokens, they can all be wrapped up and passed down into the project where the theme is being used.\nThis example is pretty small, but imagine having a whole series of sites leveraging multiple themes that utilize your design system, checkout flow, or data fetching. When they are all just made up of themes, the designers can focus on designing, and theme authors can neatly package up exactly what they want, and the possibilities are awesome.\nYou can view the code used for this demo here: https://github.com/gillkyle/gatsby-themes-demo-docz\nI\u2019m really excited about themes and think they are deserving of the hype around them. There have already been a lot of cool uses for them in addition to projects like Docz. For instance, Apollo uses their own custom Gatsby theme for consistent experiences across their docs, and spinning up derivative sites like Principled GraphQL.\nMore advanced patterns will surely emerge in time and prove just how much can be done with themes.\nIf you thought this was interesting, leave a clap or two, subscribe for future updates, tweet me your thoughts, or retweet/share this tweet: \ud83d\ude0a\n", "link": "https://medium.com/@kyle.robert.gill/a-simple-guide-to-gatsbyjs-themes-a4f9765c5ac7", "author": "Kyle Gill", "comments": [], "claps": "187 claps"}, {"num_comments": 30, "title": "How to simplify your design \u2013 UX Planet", "tags": ["ux", "simplicity", "design", "web design"], "reading_time": 12, "text": "20+ easy to follow illustrated examples\nCompanies are in constant pursuit of building simple and usable products. More features, new technologies, and advanced capabilities but still in a lightweight and simple to use format. More often than not, making it simple is the hardest thing there can be.\nWe can define simple - as something that is easily understood or done; presenting no difficulty. Simplicity is a subjective, things that appear simple for one person will not be perceived identically by another. Generally, we form our personal opinion regarding any process being simple or complex, in three quick stages:\nRemoving difficulties on the way of users to their goals \u2014 will help you move towards simplicity. In The Laws of Simplicity, John Maeda offers ten laws for balancing simplicity and complexity in business, technology, and design \u2014 guidelines for needing less and actually getting more.\nMaeda \u2014 a professor in MIT\u2019s Media Lab and a world-renowned graphic designer \u2014 explores the question of how we can redefine the notion of \u201cimproved\u201d so that it doesn\u2019t always mean something more. And a book is a great read so I really recommend you to check it out.\nWhat about complexity? Talking about simplicity we need to mention the opposite side of the spectrum. As simplicity sense of complexity is subjective. With appropriate training, even rocket science is not so hard. But there are several factors that tend to complicate even the simplest task. They should be avoided in product design as much as possible:\nThere is so much software that tries to do so much for so many audiences, everyone tries to be a Swiss Army Knife of the industry. If you want your product to be simple you need to define a core value and identify who is this product really for. Not every product should have Facebook built-in.\nThe simplest way to achieve simplicity is through thoughtful reduction. When in doubt, just remove. Secondary information, not frequently used controls, and distracting styles. It\u2019s as easy as that. Once you start to apply this principle you will immediately see the results. But be careful of what you remove.\nMajority of products that we design daily are focused on a lot of data that the user needs to make sense of in order to efficiently carry on their daily task. When you know users interested in trends and changes, help them with visual representation rather than a bunch of numbers. You always can show additional information on demand. Try to extract the meaningful from the data you have and put it in front of the user.\nUsers bombarded with choices have to take time to interpret and decide, giving them work they don\u2019t want. This was famously explained by Hick\u2019s Law. Hick\u2019s Law predicts that the time and the effort it takes to make a decision increases with the number of options. So if you want your user experience to feel simple you need to support quick decision making as much as possible. Eliminate the need to choose when is not required, guide and handhold user.\nCurrent psychological theory and research affirm the positive affective and motivational consequences of having personal choice. These findings have led to the popular notion that the more choice, the better \u2014 that the human ability to manage, and the human desire for, a choice is unlimited. But in reality, research proves the opposite.\nThe Jam Experiment is one of the most famous experiments in consumer psychology; offering consumers less choice can be good for sales. Critically, the study reveals when precisely offering less choice may enhance your sales.\nThis experiment seemingly proves that customers presented with fewer choices are 10 times more likely to purchase compared with those who are shown many choices. It has been helping up as a crucial example of choice overload, the idea that presenting customers with too many choices actually inhibits customer purchases.\nWhen choices cannot be avoided, try to limit them. Provide a recommendation yourself or share statistics of what is most preferred by other customers. Clearly communicate to the user what the key difference between proposed options. This approach is often used on pricing plans pages.\nWhen you understand the journey of your user to reach their goals, on every stage of that journey are things that are more relevant and will help you to progress to the final goal. Find those key areas and draw user attention to them.\nHow many times you heard \u2014 \u201cUsers don\u2019t read\u201d. And it\u2019s kind of true, we are really selective to what we actually remember or deep dive to. If you ever accepted Huge User Policies without reading a word then you know what I mean. There are so many characteristics that can influence what type communicates: typeface & font, size, kerning, leading, capitalization, and color. Use that to communicate the hierarchy of content. With right use color and typography, you will be able to reflect product branding and make it instantly recognizable, much more attractive and memorable.\nLet\u2019s take a simple test. In the illustration below we have 2 images. Use a stopwatch to measure how much time(and effort) it will take for you to count the number of black dots in each square.\nFinished? As you will see for yourself counting the unorganized square of dots took considerably more time, and in addition to that put a much more cognitive load on you. Why we had this result if the squares have an identical number of dots?\nMapping dots on to a specific matrix, helped us scan them visually, and group when counting. While in the unorganized square we had to go dot by dot, counting them individually. In addition, many of you probably made a miscalculation or was forced to double check your result with left image.\nOrganization of elements not only improves recognition but also makes it easier to remember. When operating any machine, it\u2019s very important to remember the position and function of all controls. Let\u2019s do another small exercise. It\u2019s only a minute ago you were counting the dots in 2 images, now please recall the position of every dot in 2 squares. For majority recalling the unorganized structure is close to impossible.\nOften an easy way to simplify complex page is to start grouping components. At that point, users are dealing with few groups rather than with multitudes of unrelated components. Adding borders (creating common regions) around an element or group of elements is an easy way to create separation from surrounding elements. There are multiple principles of grouping in Gestalt psychology that help items feel related: Proximity, Similarity, Continuity, Closure, and Connectedness.\nDifferent kinds of forms are present almost in any product. It\u2019s a way you capture user information. Sometimes even after removing everything unnecessary, those can get huge. Such forms can be very demotivation for the user to finish. So what we can do is break up that huge task into a series of smaller ones. All of a sudden it seems much easier to carry out this process to the end. Finishing small subtask gives the user a portion of endorphins and satisfaction to carry on.\nWhen designing forms, use one column layout instead of multiple columns. One column layout is much easier to fill out. This way user doesn\u2019t need to think what to fill out next, simply moving down the page in straight line.\nUncertainty makes us anxious, it should be avoided as much as possible. That\u2019s why at any time unless it\u2019s obvious, the user should be able to see where he is currently in the process, where he coming from and what\u2019s coming next. Keeping a summary of the previously provided information is also a good idea, it lower loads on user memory and removes the need to go back to double check previous steps.\nHuman brain bad at raw arithmetic involving numbers. Evolutionary pressures have favored brains optimized for object recognition compared to arithmetical operations. Try to leverage the system to do all calculations instead of the user.\nProgressive disclosure is a design pattern used in UX design to make user interfaces easier for users to interpret. It involves sequencing information and actions across several screens so as not to overwhelm the user or hiding irrelevant information until it becomes relevant. Progressive disclosure follows the typical notion of moving from \u201cabstract to specific,\u201d including the sequencing of user behaviors or interactions. A good example of progressive disclosure is iOS nested doll navigation.\nUsers spend most of their time on other products. This means that users prefer your site to work the same way as all the other sites they already know, and they come on with specific expectations to how your product should look and behave. This statement holds true for any digital or physical product from social network to your fridge and reflects consumer mindset. That\u2019s doesn\u2019t mean you should stop innovating, more to evaluate whether a depart from traditional ways presenting navigation or controls, justifies user to change their mental model.\nThe primary goal of any design should be connecting users to the value product provides as soon as possible. Think about that for a second. So anything that stands between a user and him actually operating a system, is a barrier unless it serves a functional need. The first-time experience is very important for any process, we humans are very quick to form our opinion about the product and walk away immediately if we are not satisfied.\nEven the simplest task is challenging if you try to do it the first time. Sometimes additional training is required before we can operate the product. In digital design I suggest to forget a manual approach, user expectation is the product should be simple enough to understand and they expect help on demand, or when something goes wrong. Provide contextual help instead of an upfront overwhelming user with learning material, design for empty states\nSimplicity as we already defined by how easily you can actually use the product, with its ergonomics. Ergonomics is the process of designing or arranging workplaces, products, and systems so that they fit the people who operate them. Most people think it is something to do with seating or with the design of car controls and instruments \u2014 and it is... but it is so much more. Ergonomics applies to the design of anything that involves people, including digital products. In 1954, psychologist Paul Fitts, examining the human motor system, showed that the time required to move to a target depends on the distance to it and relates inversely to its size. So make sure commonly used elements large and position them close to users.\nRemove all unnecessary interactions, views, steps in every process. There is an optimal speed at which the user should operate the system, it called a \u201cstate of the flow\u201d. Don\u2019t break that flow with popups. For all actions/values that can be changed later, support inline edit as much as possible. Autosuggest values when a great number of values is available.\nSmart defaults are selections put in place that provide answers to questions for you. This supports users to complete forms faster. Filling in forms requires people them to parse it, formulate a response, and then input their answer into the affordance provided on the form. Defining relevant defaults, designers need to understand users and the context in which they will use a product. This is only possible with deep research and testing, to learn from their users and adjust defaults based on their users\u2019 historical data and usage patterns. Always set the default to the choice the vast majority of users (say, 90\u201395 percent) would choose if explicit choices were required.\nError messages bring a lot of stress and bring the users a feeling that they messed up or not up to the task. Ensure automatic check for entered data and provide alerts or reminders for inappropriate data entries to reduce errors. Either eliminate error-prone conditions or check for them and present users with a confirmation option before they commit to the action. Destructive and irrecoverable actions should be guarded with a forcing function to ensure that users conscious of the impact their choice will have.\nAs a designer, your goals are to champion accessibility, make sure your product is accessible by a broader audience without exclusions. There are over 1 billion people worldwide who have a disability. Don\u2019t use color as the only visual means of conveying information. Ensure sufficient contrast between text and its background, support keyboard navigation etc. Accessibility is not confined to a group of users with some different abilities, when you design for accessibility you improve the experience for everyone using the product.\nDesigning simple to use and understand products is not easy, but its a way to go, and there are quick ways to move towards simplicity.\n", "link": "https://uxplanet.org/how-to-simplify-your-design-69d97fde11b9", "author": "Taras Bakusevych", "comments": ["Great work Taras Bakusevych", "Nice article, well illustrated, well explained", "Thanks, Thomas!", "Bravo!", "Nice article, thank u for sharing\u00a0:D", "Great work!!", "Thorough.

The focus is on efficiency: Learn the right topics that are in demand right now so you can get hired as soon as possible.\nThese are the steps that you should be taking if you want to learn to code in 2019, change your career, and become a web developer.\nThis is part 1 of a 2 part series. You can read the second part here.\nIf you are a complete beginner, junior developer, or are curious about this industry, this post is for you. However, if you are an established developer, you may find some useful links in here as I list the best free resources to supercharge your skills, but I also wrote a post on how to become a senior software developer that may be more useful to you.\nIf you find this post too long, you can skip over and start from the 5 Months, Step By Step Section. But you\u2019ll hurt my feelings...so you know, you can live with that guilt.\nUsing only free online courses, tutorials and free tools, you can gain a valuable skill that will allow you to be employed in a great industry that is rewarding, challenging, and with a lot of options to move around the world (more on this later). Best part? You don\u2019t need a college degree or an expensive bootcamp.\nImportant note: The post may seem like a step by step guide of what to do to become a developer, but if you look closely, it is a strategy that you can apply to any sort of learning.\nBefore we get into the steps you can take to become a developer, we must first dive into why you would want to go down this path. Every decision that will require significant time of your life should be justified. Time, after all, is the most important resource we have:\nA. You want to be working in an industry where there is a high demand for the skill and many possibilities to be in highly important roles at the top of the food chain.\nB. You love being location independent. You want a skill that allows you to go anywhere in the world and still be able to find a job easily. If you decide to move to Iceland tomorrow, you want to make sure that you won\u2019t have issues finding a job.\nC. You\u2019ve noticed the difference between 2004 and 2019 and how much of a technological progress we have made in those short 15 years. You want to be at the forefront of an industry that is impacting the world.\nD. The biggest industry growth in the last couple of years has been in the cryptocurrency (Bitcoin), and artificial intelligence (Machine Learning) space. We interact with technology on the daily, and you want to not be left behind in the dust as these take over our future. You want to understand and be able to pick up the skills underling all of these: programming. Web Development is a great foot in the door to these industries.\nE. You think change is good, and learning should never stop. So why not do something new?\nWhen choosing a new career path here are some good must/nice to-haves:\n1. It must be relevant for the next 10+ years. This skill should be valued many years in the future guaranteeing you job security.\n2. Demand for people with this skill must be higher than the supply. The less available pool of skilled workers in the industry, the more control you can have over your job and companies you work for.\n3. Ability to have a high salary regardless of years in the industry. You don\u2019t want to spend many years climbing the corporate ladder until you make a decent living.\n4. An industry that doesn\u2019t require a specialized degree from a university. You don\u2019t want to spend the next 4 years getting into debt and going to a graduate program before you start making money. And yes, I think there are better alternatives than going to an expensive coding bootcamp.\n5. Ability to catch up to the top performers in the industry in the shortest amount of time. Can little experience still get you employed? And can you close the gap as fast as possible to be considered a senior or an expert in the field?\n6. It must allow you to build foundational skills that will give you multiple career options no matter what the future holds. For example, by learning to code, you\u2019re able to better understand new up-coming technologies like distributed applications, machine learning, and cloud computing, and chose which field you want to jump into next.\n7. Have fun. The most important one. Can you see yourself doing this 40 hours a week for a long time?\nCoding hits every one of the points above in my experience. Your mileage may vary.\nOne of my favourite books is titled So Good They Can\u2019t Ignore You. In there, the author argues that passion is a myth. You shouldn\u2019t go into the travel industry because you are \u201cpassionate\u201d about travel. Most people find passion by struggling and working hard to master a skill. Once people start acknowledging your valuable skills, and you are able to feel respected for these skills, that\u2019s when you develop passion for what you do.\nIMPORTANT POINT READ IT: keep in mind that the first 2 months will feel like you are climbing an insurmountable mountain. Every tutorial, course or lesson you do will make you feel like you are the only person in the world that doesn\u2019t know this stuff. Stay strong. You will get there and you will have more and more \u2018AHA!\u2019 moments as time progresses. We call this the Impostor\u2019s Syndrome: you feel like you are the only one who doesn\u2019t know this information and you are surrounded by self-doubt. Rest assured we all feel this way when we learn something new.\nWhat you will learn at the end of it all is that being a good developer isn\u2019t necessarily memorizing a whole bunch of documentation. It\u2019s about learning how to solve problems using all of the tools that are available to you. It\u2019s about being a problem solver and getting from a state of not knowing to knowing.\nWow, you\u2019re direct, but I guess that\u2019s a fair question. First off, I\u2019m a senior software developer that has worked in various locations including Silicon Valley at some of the top tech firms. I\u2019ve been very fortunate in my career and I actually took all of last year off to help 60,000+ people around the world become developers from scratch. But I wasn\u2019t born a computer wiz. I didn\u2019t graduate with a computer science degree. I am completely self taught.\nP.S. This part is all about me, so if you don\u2019t care (totally fair point), just skip this section. I\u2019ll get over it eventually.\nIt all started many years ago...I wanted a career change and decided to teach myself computer programming.\nI spent the first month avoiding any tutorials or books. Instead, I spent this month looking at the best way for me to learn and get hired. I wanted to be efficient, not waste my time and learn outdated technologies, or learn things that I would forget after a month. I studied other people\u2019s experiences, looked at job postings, spoke to established developers, reviewed online courses, looked at bootcamps, and even read articles by futurists on where we will be with technology in 20 years. Based on those, I created a curriculum for myself focused on efficiency: The critical amount of learning in order to be employable in the shortest amount of time.\nIf you love the works of Tim Ferriss as much as I do, you\u2019re going to love this. The curriculum isn\u2019t focused on doing the least amount of work. Instead, it is focused on working really hard at the things that matter most in order to be employed in the optimum way. This doesn\u2019t mean doing the bare minimum and being hired as a junior developer. If you can work hard and skip the line by jumping straight into an intermediate developer role, that is a better outcome. Luckily for you, I have already sifted through everything.\nAlthough I spent one month planning my studying instead of actually studying, it was a benefit in the long run because I wasn\u2019t running blind. I knew where I was going, and I had a map to the finish line. You will too.\nSo yes, I\u2019ve been where you are and I know what it takes. When I was getting started, I wish there was something like this that outlined things for me step by step. I also found many tutorials were taught by people with a lot of technical knowledge but without being able to properly teach a novice. I\u2019ve read and studied every single video, tutorial and course that time permitted, and I still do.\nSince then, I have consulted for Fortune 500 tech companies, ran coding workshops, consulted on published tech books, given technical talks, and I have helped those with zero experience in programming get jobs in just a few months. Mainly because I think bootcamps overcharge you money. And don\u2019t worry, you can do it for free as you will see below. I am now in a position where I don\u2019t have to work for anybody. I love this career and I think many people would enjoy it and benefit from it as well. So I\u2019m on a mission to help others who want to make this jump.\nOk that last sentence was a wee bit dramatic...\ud83e\udd14\nYou are going to become a Javascript ninja/ninjess for the following reasons:\n\u2192 Javascript is everywhere. Every company that has a website or an app needs someone with Javascript knowledge. This language is a requirement for a TON of job postings (If you don\u2019t trust me, search for Javascript in your area on LinkedIn).\n\u2192 With the introduction of Node.js, you can use Javascript to create a full-stack app (english = you can use javascript to build your entire project). Using tools like Electron, React Native and many others, Javascript allows you to build a desktop app, a mobile app, a web app, and even VR apps. You can control robots by using something like Jonny-Five. You can build your own blockchain. Lisk, an ethereum like platform uses javascript. Want to use AI and Machine Learning? Great, you can use Javascript to do all of that too.\n\u2192 If you didn\u2019t read the first point and you were thinking about something else, let me reiterate: Industry demand for Javascript experts is HUGE. It is the most in demand language by employers. It is not uncommon for developers to get contacted by recruiters and head hunters multiple times a week for job offers.\n\u2192 Javascript community is growing at a crazy fast pace. There is a lot of new developments in the community. Some people complain about Javascript fatigue, since more and more new tools are being developed every day. However, we can use this to our advantage. You would be learning these new technologies at the same time as people who have been in the industry for years.\nTrust me, it is a great community with a lot of demand. If you don\u2019t trust me, here is a trending developer skills analysis.\nEnough jabber, let\u2019s get started. Below you will find what I believe are the best for you to get the most out of your time. By the end of 5 months, you should be able to land your first real non-entry level programming job. No bootcamps. Just you and your determination.\nWe will be focusing on the most employable and in demand skills in 2019. No time for outdated technologies like PHP or jQuery. There is nothing wrong with them, and I have total respect, but based on some of the emails I have received over the years from you, a lot of people are in financial need and have families that they have to support. Time is important to you and you want to be employable as soon as possible and learn the modern skills.\nBig question to answer: How do computers, the internet, and websites work? How can I build a website?\nBig question to answer: How does javascript make machines do what you want?\nBig question to answer: Can I build a professional looking website and understand the entire process?\nBig question to answer: What problem does React or Vue solve?\nI\u2019m heavily biased. I love React.js. As a matter of fact, I teach it to others and run workshops on it. So just trust me on this one. Learn React unless you have a good reason to learn Vue.js. Vue is new and exciting, but the job demand on average just isn\u2019t as high yet.\nBig question to answer: Where do servers, databases, and raspberryPis fit into all of this?\n***I can already hear people screaming at me with the above suggestion. \u201cAre you out of your mind?! You don\u2019t think <Enter topic in the last part here> is important?\u201d But hear me out. I do agree that these are important topics to cover in order to be a good developer, and everybody should learn the skills. However, we are trying to build a trunk of foundation here. It is easy to start diving deep into a topic, but without the foundation you won\u2019t actually know why it\u2019s important, or how it relates to what you are doing. Additionally, in most job postings I found, there was very little mention of the above skills. Just save learning these until you are on the job.***\nREMEMBER: your goal is to get employed in the most efficient manner.\nBy the end of the 5 months you should have the below requirements completed:\n1. Learn HTML and CSS. Then, buy a domain, buy hosting from a place like BlueHost or HostGator, get the cheapest option, make a website, and put it online. You can skip this option if you would like to use Github Pages which is free. But if you can afford it, actually buy one of the above hosting platforms so you understand how they work. This is going to be your portfolio from now on. Learn how to update it and make edits. As you learn new things, continue to make it nicer and nicer. Don\u2019t spend too much time on this. Just enough to show that you\u2019re able to put something online and make it look nice. Focus on having 1~2 really good and big projects in your portfolio instead of 30 small ones that anyone can build in a day (since employers won\u2019t find this impressive).\n2. Start learning Javascript. Now how can you make your website interactive?Go through the above resources and see what Javascript does.\n3. Start pushing your little projects to GitHub. Employers will look at your GitHub profile and how active you are on there. Try to make commits 5 times a week on your personal projects. Also try reading through this and contributing to some open source projects like freeCodeCamp or zerotomastery.\n4. Learn to google and use Stack Overflow when you have problems. 99% of problems you will encounter when you start out can be found online. Or join the Javascript IRC channel and ask questions when you are stuck. Your local community might also have a slack channel. If not, pick one from here and talk to other developers. The key is to figure out how to solve your own problems and not always follow a tutorial and watch somebody else answer your questions.\n5. Become comfortable using a command line to do things. Always have it open when practicing and try using it instead of the GUI (graphical user interface).\n6. Learn the newest language features and trends in Javascript, and learn to solve problems with them (i.e. Promises, ES6, ES7, ES8, ES9, functional programming techniques).\n7. Attend local meet-ups and start talking to people. You will be really overwhelmed and confused by all of the things you don\u2019t know. Don\u2019t worry as this is natural. Just start meeting other coders so you can be surrounded by the lingo and jargon.\n8. Start listening to the podcast: Javascript Jabber. This will get yourself familiar with the jargon so when interview time comes, it doesn\u2019t overwhelm you. The first few times you listen, you will have no idea what they are talking about. Don\u2019t lose hope. Eventually it will all make sense. FunFunFunction is also a great weekly youtube channel you should follow although the older videos (most popular) are better to watch than the newer ones. For a more complex podcast, but probably the best on software, check out Software Engineering Daily. Also keep an eye out on the state of javascript survey every year to see what is trending in the industry.\n9. Start applying to recruitment agencies early. We are going to use them as practice. Most of these have practice interviews with professional coders so they can rank your skill, but you can use these to practice programming question, and ask these experts any questions you want!\n10. Start applying for jobs for which you are way under-qualified for. You will get some interviews. You should never settle for a job. If you never ask, the answer is always no. See part 2 for more detail on this.\n11. Make your LinkedIn profile look nice. Don\u2019t spent too much time on your resume. Make it one page, make it concise, and write down all the skills you\u2019ve learned in the previous months. Use a prebuilt template like this. Being self taught shows a lot of courage. Remember that your resume is just to get you an interview, after which, they are as good as paper towels...ok bad analogy because paper towels are very useful. I spent less than 2 hours on my resume. What makes you different than other developers is the fact that you come from a different field and background. How is this going to differentiate you?\n12. Interview and be amazed at how employable you are. Not all of them will go well, but then again, not many developers learned everything in the last 5 months. It shows ambition. ONLY apply to jobs on LinkedIn, and the rest should just be you emailing directly, referrals, or calling the company you want to work for. Don\u2019t waste your time on mass Craigslist, Kijiji, or Monster.com, or other job board ads. You can also use services like Indeed prime or hired if you want.\nMost people have an idea that you need to get something 100% before they can move on to the next step. However, for most skills, including programming, the closer you get to 100%, the longer it takes to get there. You only have 5 months. The last 20% will be better served actually working in teams, on real projects (and getting paid). So we are only focusing on getting 80% of the knowledge to use our time efficiently.\nTechnology is always changing. This is especially true with web development. Things are moving so fast right now that it is impossible to know every single library, syntax, or framework. What you do need to know is how everything fits together and what each technology is trying to solve. Most importantly, you just need to know it exists so you can look into it and figure it out when the time comes on the job. Programmers are problem solvers. Learn to solve problems with the tools available to you. Most of us spend a lot of time on pages like StackOverflow or researching google because there are so many resources out there. Once you build the foundation of your knowledge, you can go anywhere. You just need to know how to look for answers and ask questions.\nFocus on efficiency. The reason most of us give up on a goal is because we don\u2019t see results. By focusing on the things that matter, it makes learning fun. But it doesn\u2019t end here. Learning never stops, and your goal was to get employed as soon as possible so that from that point on, everyday you are receiving a salary to learn.\nCoding gets more and more fun with each passing day and it\u2019s even better when you are getting paid every day to solve problems and develop your skills. The real growth happens when you start working on real projects with real teams. That\u2019s why I strongly believe that you want your \u2018study\u2019 period to be as short as possible, in order to avoid debt, and increase your time in the best environment for learning: working in teams. I wouldn\u2019t even recommend freelancing to start off. You want to surround yourself in an environment where everybody is smarter than you and you are working everyday with them. From there, be a sponge and absorb all of the information.\nWe\u2019re building that trunk. When that trunk gets big and strong, and the roots are all put into place, your rate of learning new things will be exponential.You\u2019ll form leaves of knowledge faster and faster with each passing day.\nI created an online course: The Complete Web Developer in 2019 where I walk you through the entire steps I mentioned above if you want everything in one place, extra help, or you want to support my work. We also have a private community of thousands of developers going through the course and helping each other out every day. It\u2019s over 200 HD videos and 30+ hours of content. It took an insane # of hours to make. But I\u2019m really proud of how everything turned out. It is discounted for the holiday season to $10 to start off the year (for first 100 signups) and I strongly believe it is better than any bootcamp material out there.\nUpdate: We\u2019ve passed 60,000 students from over 191 countries who have enrolled!\nGo to Part 2 of this article: Don\u2019t Be A Junior Developer\nThank you for reading this far.

There are a lot of factors that can cause slow loading time. For this article, I want to focus on one particular aspect \u2014 images.\nImages are still the number one cause of bloat on the web. Loading images take up massive amounts of bandwidth because they often have large file sizes.\nOptimizing images can significantly improve web page load time, resulting in improved user satisfaction.\nPerform a site audit through the Website Speed Test Image Analysis Tool and it will highlight opportunities to better optimize your images.\nNow, let\u2019s discuss the actual rules:\nAccording to Google, images are the 2nd highest predictor of conversions. In many cases, it\u2019s possible to track a direct connection between the number of images page have and loading time.\nThe smaller in file-size you can make your images, the better a network experience you can offer your users. Squoosh will help you to manipulate images at the optimal compression levels. This tool can significantly reduce the size of images while preserving visual quality.\nDo image optimization in terms of formats:\nResizing images are expensive operations for a browser (especially on mobile hardware). Thus, try to reduce unnecessary image resize costs. Use the Responsive Image Breakpoints Generator to create properly-sized images.\nIdeally, you should automate this operation. Service Cloudinary or Imgix can help you with that.\nYou check the efficiency of your responsive markup using imaging-heap. This simple command line tool will show you the efficiency across viewport sizes and device pixel ratios.\nMake sure to clean up unused assets. You can track such images by searching the display:none property in your CSS.\nAlso, track images that are loaded by default, but might never be displayed (for instance, images in a carousel).\nLazy loading is a web performance pattern that delays the loading of images in the browser until the user needs to see it. Usually, the image loading is triggered on scroll \u2014 images load asynchronously on demand when a user reaches an appropriate part of the page. This technique is commonly used on many content-heavy websites such as Medium.\nLazy loading is not yet natively supported in the browser itself. But it\u2019s possible to use JavaScript libraries to add this capability. You can use lazysizes or yall.js for that.\nUsing animated GIFs in page layout introduce both rendering performance and bandwidth problems. Instead of adding huge animated GIFs, try to use AV1 or WebM videos.\nDepending on how much images you have, you might want to push it to a CDN. But double-check whether your CDN performs compression and conversion.\nAll tools from this article can be found here:\nFollow UX Planet: Twitter| Facebook\n", "link": "https://uxplanet.org/essential-guide-for-web-performance-optimization-1b883d638a1", "author": "Nick Babich", "comments": ["Native lazy loading is coming to chrome 75 and can already be used by enabling the Enable lazy image loading flag.

I\u2019m sitting in front a blank Photoshop file on an iMac (I was a Windows user back then). I\u2019m trying to grasp what my manager just briefed me about. I have no idea how to start. Blank.\nBefore landing that job, I had just graduated from university with a Multimedia degree. So, why did I not know anything about design?Well, universities don\u2019t teach us practical design. Most university courses only teach us theory and sometimes teach us how to use design tools like Adobe Suite. But that\u2019s not enough \u2014 not even close.\n7 years later of self-teaching, I\u2019m now a Design Teacher and International Conference Speaker.\nThe first thing you should know is:\nWe\u2019re not some unicorn creatures that were meant to be designers and were just born artistic like that. Design is learned.Design is about solving problems. It\u2019s a process of constantly finding problems and creating solutions for them.\nThere are many areas of design: UI, UX, product designers, graphic designers, interaction designers, information architect, and the list goes on. Start by figuring out which specialty interest you more.For now, let\u2019s focus on the most common type: a mix of interface and experience: UI/UX designer.\nBefore practicing design, the first thing you need to do is learn some design principles. From this, you\u2019ll be able to enter the design world and start thinking \u201ccreatively\u201d. You will learn the psychological aspects of design: why it can look good and why it can fail.\nHere are some basic principles you should know about.\nColor vocabulary, fundamentals and the psychology of colors.Principles of design: Color\nSymmetry and assymetry.Principles of design: Balance\nUsing contrast to organize information, build hierarchy and create focus.Principles of design: contrast\nChoosing fonts and creating readable text on the web.10 Principles Of Readability And Web Typography\nThe most important principle, creating intuitive and usable designs starts here.Design principle: Consistency\nHere are some great do\u2019s and don\u2019ts to design a good UI.\nThe next thing is to understand the creative process. UI/UX design is a process of specific phases that every creative person goes through.\nDivided into four distinct phases \u2014 Discover, Define, Develop and Deliver \u2014 the Double Diamond is a simple visual map of the design process.\nThis is the start of the project. Designers start researching, getting inspired, and gathering ideas.\nThis is the definition stage, where designers define an idea extracted from the Discover phase. From this, a clear creative brief is created.\nThis is where solutions or concepts are created, prototyped, tested and iterated. This process of trial and error helps designers to improve and refine their ideas.\nThe final phase is the delivery stage, where the final project is finalised, produced and launched.\nCheck out my article How to streamline your UI/UX workflow with Figma.\nKnowing design principles is great, but sometimes it\u2019s not enough, you also have to train your eye to see good design and bad design and to identify strengths and weaknesses in designs.\nThe most effective way to train your eye for design is through inspiration.Before opening a blank canvas and staring at it for half an hour, know that the only way to be creative is through research. Sometimes the mind can\u2019t create ideas on its own, you have to first look at other designs to start creating your own, especially when you\u2019re a beginner.\nSo look at what other designers are doing on Dribbble, and whenever you come across pretty designs or something relevant to your project, save it in your notes and mention what you like about it, you can also take screenshots. This way, you will have a collection of inspirational designs for you to start from.\nHere are my favorite websites for inspiration:\nTo make ourselves get familiar with design, the best way is to read a few articles each day.\nMake reading design news and blog an everyday habit. There are millions of articles available online for us to discover about new trends, use cases and tutorials. All we have to do is find them. There\u2019s nothing better than learning from other people\u2019s experiences.\nSo start your day with a cup of coffee and a few inspirational articles on Medium or Smashing Magazine. Learning new things in the morning will broaden your mind and will make room for creativity during the day.\nThen, every now and then during your day, take a few breaks to read more. Taking breaks is very important for creativity, especially when you get stuck and feel unproductive. Bookmark the website you like as your browser homepage or subscribe to a design newsletter.\nHere are my favorite blog and news websites for design:\nPractice makes perfect. And we all know we can\u2019t get clients/jobs without experience. But without a job or projects, we can\u2019t practice, right?\nBut we can break this cycle by practicing on our own, by creating fake projects for fun! Dribbble is full of it.\nMake time to pick a website or app you already use and redesign it. It could be anything you think it can be better. You can also design your own app idea.\nFrom this, you\u2019ll build your design portfolio and you\u2019ll practice design.\nThere are tons of design tools out there, but you don\u2019t need to know all of them. Get to know the best ones out there, choose your favorites and stay updated with the newest features and trends.\nHere are the latest tools that I use in my design process:\nAnother great way to learn design is to find a design mentor or designer friend who is willing to help. They will help you speed up your learning process.\nThe designer would review your work and give their comments whenever possible. It\u2019s like a shortcut. They would also give you tips and tricks they learned from their experience. So go ahead and e-mail a designer, ask questions and discuss your concerns.\nAlso, from the few years that I taught design and front-end, I learned more than I taught. When you\u2019re ready to start talking about design with people, you can mentor or educate someone about design. You will learn to see it from a different perspective and you will get feedback and questions that you might\u2019ve never thought about.\nWhenever you\u2019re talking about design with other people, your mind will be in \u201cbrainstorm\u201d mode all the time and you will find yourself getting interested in design more and more.\nCheck out my Awesome Web Design github repository, a curated list of resources for web designers.\nIf you liked this post, make sure to give me some \ud83d\udc4f below and follow my blog for more design articles.
