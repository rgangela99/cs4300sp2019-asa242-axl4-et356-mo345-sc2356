        <h3>Flipping Media</h3>
        <p>MediaFlip is designed to help you learn something new by swapping the type of media. Enter in a Medium article link and select "Medium
          Article to YouTube Video" from the dropdown menu. This will return the top 10 most similar YouTube videos for you to watch.
          Or enter in a YouTube video link and select "YouTube Video to Medium Article" from the dropdown menu. This will return the top
           10 most similar Medium articles for you to read.</p>
        <br>
        <h3>Added Features</h3>
        <p>In addition to providing a YouTube/Medium link, you can also provide keywords. Enter terms into the keyword box separated by
           commas and no spaces. This will search for videos/articles most similar to the link you entered but will also take the keywords
           into account. This feature is useful if you are interested in changing up the topics you are learning about or want to further
           improve the returned search results.
           You can also provide the maximum amount of time you want to spend watching a single video or reading a single article. This will return similar results that
           also take into account how much time you have and returns videos/articles relative to your time constraints.</p>
        <br>
        <h3>About the Data</h3>
        <p>The Medium dataset is based on popular Medium articles. Because Medium is known for providing Technology articles,
           YouTube to Medium swaps work best for technology videos.

           The YouTube dataset is mostly sourced from popular learning channels and recommended documentaries, however there
           are some Comedy videos that are also included in the dataset. The results for Medium to YouTube swaps work best with
           concrete topics including technology.</p>
        <br>
        <h3>How it Works</h3>
        <p>Our algorithm uses Singular Value Decomposition to determine the videos/articles that are most similar by topic
             to the link provided. In addition there are a variety of other factors added in as partial weights
             to the similarity score. The number of likes/claps are used to ensure that the returned results are fairly
             popular. The comments on videos and articles are used to determine whether or not the discussions match the
             topics of a link. There is also sentiment analysis done to determine whether the comments are reacting positively
             to the related videos/articles. Any additional features provided in the query are also used to improve the results. </p>
