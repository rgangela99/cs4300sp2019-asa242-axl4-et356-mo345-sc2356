The Sun probably won’t form one, but higher mass stars do.\\n\\n--\\n\\nTable of Contents\\nWhen low mass stars die they form white dwarfs 0:54\\nWhite dwarfs are roughly the size of Earth 2:16\\nCloudy with a chance of Planetary Nebulae 3:59\\nLife Span 9:06\\n\\n--\\n\\nPBS Digital Studios: http://youtube.com/pbsdigitalstudios\\n\\nFollow Phil on Twitter: https://twitter.com/badastronomer\\n\\nWant to find Crash Course elsewhere on the internet?\\nFacebook - http://www.facebook.com/YouTubeCrashCourse\\nTwitter - http://www.twitter.com/TheCrashCourse\\nTumblr - http://thecrashcourse.tumblr.com \\nSupport CrashCourse on Patreon: http://www.patreon.com/crashcourse\\n\\n--\\n\\nPHOTOS/VIDEOS\\nJourney to the centre of the Sun http://www.spacetelescope.org/videos/astro_ac/ [credit: ESA/Hubble (M.

Stellar mass black holes form when a very massive star dies, and its core collapses. The core has to be more than about 2.8 times the Sun’s mass to form a black hole.

As a result, the highlighted line for the row at address 12 should actually be one line higher.  \\n\\n\\nProduced in collaboration with PBS Digital Studios: http://youtube.com/pbsdigitalstudios\\n\\nThe Latest from PBS Digital Studios: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL1mtdjDVOoOqJzeaJAV15Tq0tZ1vKj7ZV\\n\\nWe’ve got merch!\\nhttps://store.dftba.com/collections/crashcourse\\n\\n\\nWant to know more about Carrie Anne?\\nhttps://about.me/carrieannephilbin\\n\\nWant to find Crash Course elsewhere on the internet?\\nFacebook - http://www.facebook.com/YouTubeCrashC...\\nTwitter - http://www.twitter.com/TheCrashCourse\\nTumblr - http://thecrashcourse.tumblr.com \\nSupport Crash Course on Patreon: http://patreon.com/crashcourse\\nCC Kids: http://www.youtube.com/crashcoursekids\\n\\nWant to find Crash Course elsewhere on the internet?\\nFacebook - http://www.facebook.com/YouTubeCrashC...\\nTwitter - http://www.twitter.com/TheCrashCourse\\nTumblr - http://thecrashcourse.tumblr.com \\nSupport Crash Course on Patreon: http://patreon.com/crashcourse\\n\\nCC Kids: http://www.youtube.com/crashcoursekids'}, 'defaultAudioLanguage': 'en'}, 'contentDetails': {'duration': 'PT12M17S', 'dimension': '2d', 'definition': 'hd', 'caption': 'true', 'licensedContent': True, 'projection': 'rectangular'}, 'statistics': {'viewCount': '697398', 'likeCount': '15093', 'dislikeCount': '196', 'favoriteCount': '0', 'commentCount': '992'}}, {'kind': 'youtube#video', 'etag': '\"XpPGQXPnxQJhLgs6enD_n8JR4Qk/naMq4ITMR15F3cYcDHEvMJ83rXo\"', 'id': 'KlgR1q3UQZE', 'snippet': {'publishedAt': '2017-10-03T21:00:00.000Z', 'channelId': 'UCX6b17PVsYBQ0ip5gyeme-Q', 'title': 'Papers & Essays: Crash Course Study Skills #9', 'description': 'Writing research papers is an essential skill in your career as a student, and this week we’re going to help you do that like a pro.

Welcome to Crash Course Computer Science! So today, we’re going to take a look at computing’s origins, because even though our digital computers are relatively new, the need for computation is not. Since the start of civilization itself, humans have had an increasing need for special devices to help manage laborious tasks, and as the scale of society continued to grow, these computational devices began to play a crucial role in amplifying our mental abilities.

In 1800, the human population of the Earth passed 1 billion, and Thomas Malthus posited that growth had hit its ceiling, and the population would level off and stop growing. He was totally right. Just kidding, he was totally wrong! There are like 7 billion people on the planet now! John will teach a little about how Malthus made his calculations, and explain how Malthus came up with the wrong answer. As is often the case, it has to do with making projections based on faulty assumptions. Man, people do that a lot.\\n\\nYou can directly support Crash Course at https://www.patreon.com/crashcourse Subscribe for as little as $0 to keep up with everything we're doing.

What, you may ask, is the Gilded Age? The term comes from a book by Mark Twain and Charles Dudley Warner titled, \"The Gilded Age.\" You may see a pattern emerging here. It started in the 1870s and continued on until the turn of the 20th century. The era is called Gilded because of the massive inequality that existed in the United States. Gilded Age politics were marked by a number of phenomenons, most of them having to do with corruption. On the local and state level, political machines wielded enormous power. John gets into details about the most famous political machine, Tammany Hall. Tammany Hall ran New York City for a long, long time, notably under Boss Tweed. Graft, kickbacks, and voter fraud were rampant, but not just at the local level. Ulysses S. Grant ran one of the most scandalous presidential administrations in U.S. history, and John will tell you about two of the best known scandals, the Credit Mobilier scandal and the Whiskey Ring. There were a few attempts at reform during this time, notably the Civil Service Act of 1883 and the Sherman Anti-trust act of 1890. John will also get into the Grange Movement of the western farmers, and the Populist Party that arose from that movement.

We're going to talk about Gerrymandering - that is the process in which voting districts are redrawn in a way to favor one party during elections. As you'll see, this is why election outcomes on Census years (which tend to be when districts are redrawn) are a really big deal. So we'll talk about how some of these cockamamie voting districts come to be and explain how Gerrymandering can affect the outcomes (and misrepresent voters) during elections.

What is nonviolence? What is a peace movement? Well. traditionally, humans often resort to violence when they come into conflict.
