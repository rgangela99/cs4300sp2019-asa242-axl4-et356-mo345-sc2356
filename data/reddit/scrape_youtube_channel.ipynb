People still shell out for snake oil, because the marketing is so much more sophisticated.  And so it is with the \"news\" media. \\n\\nWe know we are being manipulated.  But mostly its the lower half of the IQ bell curve that is most susceptible.  This is what truly frightens me.

That\\'s what I think Palihapitiya is saying when he suggests that we begin with a \"hard break\" from social media.
