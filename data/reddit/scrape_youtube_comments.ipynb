It is YOUR actions that will determine whether humanity will exist in 100 years time or not. And the good news is twofold: first, it's not that much you need to do, and secondly, what is good for the climate is also good for your wallet and your waste line, speak of a true win, win, win. So WHAT can YOU do (ranked by impact)?\n",
      "1. Reduce or better STOP eating dairy and red meat. No need to become a vegan, these two things are already enough to GHG clean you diet. Added bonus, a plant based diet has time and time again proven to be the healthiest diet, especially wrt your circumference. \n",

Yes, you read right, this might be the second important behavioural change, as agriculture combined contributes to a third to all GHG gasses, our diet is the area of our life where we can contribute most. The average American wastes a pound of food per day, for a family of four this equates to nearly 1,500 pounds of wasted food per year. Added bonus, you'll spend less money on groceries.\n",

But beware that at this point the overall life cycle impact of an electrical car is not necessarily positive, however, they are so much fun to drive.

Most of it can be done DIY and it doesn't cost the world, but will pay back in no time. Added bonus, lower utility bills and a much better indoor climate (less snotty children during winter time). \n",
      "7. Detect the beauty of your own city, region, and/or country. The world is beautiful everywhere and you'll be surprised how beautiful it is just around your home. Leave Thailand to the Thais and go explore the wonderful nature around you. Added bonus, no stomach bugs during vacation.\n",

And the good news is twofold: first, it's not that much you need to do, and secondly, what is good for the climate is also good for your wallet and your waste line, speak of a true win, win, win. So WHAT can YOU do (ranked by impact)?\\n1. Reduce or better STOP eating dairy and red meat. No need to become a vegan, these two things are already enough to GHG clean you diet. Added bonus, a plant based diet has time and time again proven to be the healthiest diet, especially wrt your circumference. \\n2. Reduce food waste. Yes, you read right, this might be the second important behavioural change, as agriculture combined contributes to a third to all GHG gasses, our diet is the area of our life where we can contribute most. The average American wastes a pound of food per day, for a family of four this equates to nearly 1,500 pounds of wasted food per year. Added bonus, you'll spend less money on groceries.\\n3. Buy expensive stuff, but few of it. Surprised? Manufacturing and transporting textiles and electronics produces enormous amounts of GHG and other waste products. You are hereby allowed to become a posh person, buy few things but never go for less than the very best.    \\n4. Walk, bike, row, and switch to a small, fuel-efficient car. Cars are much less of a problem than people think, as long as they weigh little and thereby are fuel-efficient. If you have the means to buy a hybrid or electrical car, even better. But beware that at this point the overall life cycle impact of an electrical car is not necessarily positive, however, they are so much fun to drive. Added bonus, your fuel bills, taxes, insurance bill, and most likely weight will drop, and the more you bike and walk the happier your MD will be, as will you. \\n5. If you can, switch to an electricity provider with 100%  renewable energy production. You won't feel any difference, I promise.\\n6. Invest in your home, buy LED bulbs (2700K gives you that warm light of a classic bulb), buy programmable thermostats, invest in energy star appliances, and weatherise your home. Most of it can be done DIY and it doesn't cost the world, but will pay back in no time. Added bonus, lower utility bills and a much better indoor climate (less snotty children during winter time). \\n7. Detect the beauty of your own city, region, and/or country. The world is beautiful everywhere and you'll be surprised how beautiful it is just around your home. Leave Thailand to the Thais and go explore the wonderful nature around you. Added bonus, no stomach bugs during vacation.\", 7), ('Greta I love you. Keep fighting for our planet.
