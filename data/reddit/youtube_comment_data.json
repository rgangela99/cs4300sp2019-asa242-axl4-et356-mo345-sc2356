I didn\u2019t want her to go home but she was hell bent on going back & my sister that was living with her helped her so I kinda felt ok about it.. anyways she kept telling me she thought she may have had another stroke because one of her arms was acting like it did when she\u2019d had her first one.. after taking her to her regular doctor \ud83d\udc68\u200d\u2695\ufe0f I talked to them & she told me she didn\u2019t think \ud83e\udd14 my mom has had another one and then I asked her to prescribe her something for her laughing n crying constantly & she looked @ me & said I don\u2019t think \ud83d\udcad ur mom can afford it.. that was really nice \ud83d\udc4d\ud83c\udffd in her to say.. after about two weeks went by and my sister called me & said my moms jaw was locked up & they took her to the hospital to try & unlock it.. the ambulance people was told she\u2019d has had a few strokes in the past n she could talk n function but her speech was bad so on their way they went..

I told him u need to ck her I think she\u2019s had another stroke a bad one.. he then jumped on me n asked me why do I think that being very RUDE & asked me where was I.. i told him I\u2019d been at home with my children & my sister lives with her and i didn\u2019t live close by but  about an 1 or so away from her.. & then i explained i gave y\u2019all instructions to call me if u needed to.. he said well your sister told the medics that she\u2019d always been like this.. I went on to explain NO she\u2019d had strokes but been getting better.. after about 25 mins of arguing with them I finally got them to re check her but believe me in this ER THEY TOOK THEIR PRECIOUS TIME.. finally they came in  & done a mri.. brought her back in the room & the doctor said I still didn\u2019t see much n we don\u2019t think she had another stroke but we will keep her over night.. in the meantime she\u2019s vomiting everywhere n they failed to even give me a rag.. another doctor came in I could tell he was foreign and he said don\u2019t worry mam we are going to find out what happened to your mom I promise omg finally someone with a touch of since he was so nice.. so he ordered a cat scan but it wasn\u2019t brought into the next morning.. that morning my aunt came into sit  with her & they did the cat scan.. then the Nero doctor came rushing into the room & said we have to put her in icu immediately because she\u2019s had a major stroke & it\u2019s caused bleeding on her brain.. ok after sitting in the icu for hours they decided to rush her to another hospital to give her a fighting chance they said so I said ok but it took them so long to decide where to fly or drive her.. you guessed it they finally drove her.. anyways at this hospital they could no longer do the surgery to save her because the blood had done spread all over her brain causing brain damage. anyway after days of watching my mom suffer in this hospital one of the nurses made a statement and she told me if they\u2019d got her there sooner we could have saved your mom but I mentioned this to the brain surgeon \ud83d\udc68\u200d\u2695\ufe0f there & he said I wouldn\u2019t go blaming anyone for it.. ya i bet u wouldn\u2019t.. anyways it was Aug 2017 she passed to this day I still say it was the hospitals fault she passed I\u2019ve tried getting an attorney to help me but they told me they would all lie for each other!

You are not aware of it when it is in the mind, \nyou become aware of it only when it strikes hard at the roots of the body. \nYou always feel the disease in the body, but it always originates in the mind.\n\nYou are not aware of it then, so you cannot do anything about it, \nbut when it comes to the body then of course you start seeking a physician, some help. \nThe physician, seeing it in the body, starts treating it in the body. It can be treated in the body -- \nbut then some other disease will arise, because the treatment has not gone to the very source. \nYou have been changing the effect, but not the cause.\n\nIf it can be changed in the mind, then the disease will disappear from the body immediately. \nThat's how modern research on hypnosis proves that every disease -- \nat least in principle -- \ncan be transformed, changed, can be dropped, if the mind is changed. \nAnd the vice versa is also true: if the mind is convinced by hypnosis, then disease can be created also.\n\nJust two or three days before, somebody sent me an article of deep significance. \nOne man -- one physician, a doctor in California -- \nhas treated many patients with cancer just through the imagination. \nThis is the first clue which opens the door.... And not one patient, many.\n\nWhat he does is he simply tells them to imagine  -- -\nif they have cancer of the throat, \nhe tells them to relax and imagine that the whole energy of their body is moving towards the throat, \nand the gland is being attacked by their energy. \nJust like arrows from everywhere, all over -- \nmoving towards the throat and attacking the disease. Within three, \nfour or six weeks the gland simply disappears without leaving a trace behind. \nAnd cancer is thought to be incurable!\n\nCancer is a modern disease; it has come because of the stress, tension and anxiety of life. \nThere has, in fact, been no cure for it up to now through the body. \nIf cancer can be treated through the mind, \nthen everything can be treated through the mind.\n\n\n\nJesus' miracles happened because the people were very trusting. \nOnce it happened: he was walking and a woman -- \na very poor woman, afraid and apprehensive about whether Jesus would treat her or not, \nbecause he was always crowded by so many people -- \nthe woman thought to herself, \"\nJust touch Jesus' garment from behind.\" \nShe did, and she was cured.\n\nJesus looked back and the woman started thanking him. \nShe fell at his feet and was very grateful. \nHe said, \"Don't be grateful to me, be grateful to God. \nYour faith has healed you, not I.\"\nOsho, Come follow to you vol.1 #5", 1], ["I saw the film in Vienna today.

The entire scraped area was no bigger than a penny. I didn't think twice about it and went on to bed. \n\nThe next day at work I thought several times about the fact that the pain from the scrape didn't just go away completely. It didn't hurt, but it was just there constantly reminding me that I had scratched myself. And I thought about the fact that usually the pain from a scrape like that is gone within an hour or 2. \n\nOn the evening of January 25, 2017 I was playing a video game called Empyrion Galactic Survival on PC and I stayed up late playing it. Around 1:30am I went to bed. I felt completely fine except I was cold. And it was a cold night so I just assumed my house was a bit cold. I lay in bed and started shivering. I tried to stop but realized i couldn't. I got up and turned the heat higher in my house and got another blanket. Went back to bed and it made no difference. I was shivering from head to toe and try as i might I could not control it. \n\nI started realizing something might be wrong. My parents lived about a mile up the road from me and around 2:00am i called my mother and described how I was cold and couldn't stop shivering. She was concerned and told me to come on up so she could take my temperature to see if i was running a fever. By then I was starting to feel asthma type symptoms as well. As a asthma sufferer I know those symptoms all too well. I drove myself up to my parents house and my mother wrapped me in a thick blanket on a recliner and I tried hard to get warm and to stop shivering but all to no avail, my shivering was only getting worse. It was completely uncontrollable and I was starting to struggle to take deep breaths. \n\nMy mother thought maybe i was having a heart attack and suggested going to the emergency room. I resisted this at first but realized quickly that this was not just a problem of being cold. So my parents drove me to the emergency room and by the time we got there I was starting to go into shock. \n\nThe doctors tested my heart, and they drew blood for testing but nothing was showing up, I had no fever and the tests were all showing up clear. The first doctor to examine me asked me if I had any idea what might be wrong and for some reason I just knew that the scratch on my leg had something to do with it. I told him about it and he checked my leg but didn't find anything and he just brushed it off. In hindsight I don't believe he even saw the scratch because of how small it was. \n\nShortly thereafter another doctor came in and was discussing test results with my parents and trying to find out what may be causing this. By then i had started running a low grade fever. I again informed this new doctor that i suspected the scratch on my leg may be the cause, he came over and this time I specifically showed him exactly where the scratch was and he immediately started asking me questions about it in a way that made me think he knew what was wrong. he rushed out and called for a new blood test and told them to test for Strep A. \n\nThat test came back positive and i was immediately admitted into the intensive care unit of the hospital. By then my kidneys had started shutting down and I was feeling very very sick. They put me on some extremely aggressive antibiotics and I ended up spending almost 10 days in the hospital. My leg swelled up to the size of a basketball. I had never felt so sick before. or after for that matter. \n\nAfter I was released I was prescribed antibiotics in pill form and about 3 days after I was home my body reacted to those antibiotics. My entire body was covered in hives and my skin literally began replacing itself. I shed skin for weeks, it was gross. But I eventually made a full recovery. \n\nInterestingly enough, when i was admitted to the hospital I was starting to drift in and out of consciousness and I dreamed, and my reality blurred, and I thought I was in that video game I had been playing, I could not tell the difference between the game in my mind and real life. Those dreams made a powerful impression on me. After i recovered, I experienced a physical reaction of nausea and sickness anytime i even thought about playing that game. I think my body somehow connected that game to the virus that was attacking me and my body tried to defend itself from it happening again by making me feel sick when I thought about playing that game. It got so bad I uninstalled it from my computer and didn't play it again for almost 2 years. I did eventually overcome that feeling of sickness over the game and about 2 years later did play it again for a while. \n\nBut yeah, my doctors told me that had I not went to the hospital when i did, there was a very good chance i would not have survived. Strep A is not something to take lightly.

Subadai was an actual brother of Temudjin. Not the son of an inferior cast who was elevated by Jamuka to the same rank as him and Temudjin. The three were birth brothers.\nThe Chinese had not harnessed gun powder as a tool of war as you suggest. They used it for fireworks displays only and gun powder was first brought to Europe by Marco Polo in 1330, well over a century after the death of Genghis Khan. Had the Mongols known about the military use of gun powder they would not have been so stunned at the 1260 battle of Ein Jalut in Palestine, now Jordan, which took place long after Genghis Khan's death where the Egyptians inflicted the first decisive and long lasting psychological defeat against the Mongols. The Egyptians used hand canons called \"medfaa\", to this day the term is used for canons, (any, fixed or field canons). These were manned by one person, with a fuse lit by a second man. They were rudimentary in projectiles and accuracy however the Mongols were shocked by them and their horses spooked by the noise, smoke and dangerous projectiles. The medfaa was quite effective and was a contributing factor to the Egyptian victory. It cleared the way for infantry, cavalry and archers to pummel the enemy very effectively. Had the Mongols been already used to gun powder, this would not have been the case as they also would have been armed similarly. The term \"baroud\" coined in Egypt, is the Arabic word for powder or \"poudre\" in French. Both \"powder\" and \"poudre\" are etymological derivatives of baroud. In later centuries, a ship on the high seas blown by the French was often called \"un baroud d'honneur\". The explosion was most likely spectacular and the word \"honor\" was use as a tease to the British naval officers who regularly told the French that they fought for money while the British fought for honor. A retort of Surcouf to one British officer who unfailingly sang the same refrain, was \" Monsieur we each fight for what we lack the most\". The term baroud had survived for centuries in its original form. The Chinese are often attributed to be the inventors of gun powder, perhaps for Europe they were but far earlier, the Egyptians used it and had harnessed its power as a tool of war well ahead of the Chinese and Europe. The Mongols had not.

Thank you :)\n\nOn the topic of emulators: As I've learned while speedrunning Tales of Phantasia or seen from Secret of Evermore, not even the simple plastic boxes that are called \"SNES\" all play the exact same way. The differences are minuscule and negligible for almost all games, at least for SNES. But then you have PS2 consoles, where there is rather major differences already, and I don't think it gets much better in later generations of consoles. So from my point of view, emulators not being accurate enough is not a particularly interesting point in general - Although in specific cases, absolutely valid. \nWhich kind of brings me to my point: It has to be decided on a case-by-case basis. Emulators are invaluable for practicing specific parts and sections of many games and figuring out tricks and strategies. They are fantastic tools and on top of that allow people to compete and play that would otherwise have no means to.

You need emergency funds, $100 dollars, and Mr. Rosenberg obliges by lending you a crispy brand new one hundred dollar bill with the stipulation that you pay back a $125 (call the additional 25 dollars interest) within a week when you get your paycheck. You walk out of his office but during the day, you realized that the emergency subsided and no longer need the 100 dollar bill.\n   \nYou return to Mr. Rosenberg that very day with $125 dollars. But Mr. Rosenberg is dismayed when he sees the very same $100 dollar bill he gave you earlier in the day. Not wanting to let the cat out of the bag Mr. Rosenberg takes the money, and kindly says \"nice doing business with you\".   \n\nSo what is the deal with this story? Mr. Rosenberg has a printing press in his basement and issues counterfeit money. The crispy new hundred dollar bill was counterfeit. When the counterfeit dollar is returned to Mr. Rosenberg, he would have only profited $25 dollars because that was the only real money (paid as interest). Mr. Rosenberg, however. is discovered by the authorities but he has the foresight to get rid of the printing press and any evidence associated with it. Mr. Rosenberg knows that the $100 dollar is phony so what does he do? He destroys it.  \n\nBanks do almost exactly the same thing except that they have one redeeming legal article and that is a negotiable instrument. The promissory note, used as a negotiable instrument, gives temporary life to the liability. The two are one and the same. When the promissory note is signed this gives life to the Liability in the institution of banks and the marketplace. In the world of banking, this promissory note is real money.   \n\nWhen a bank issues a check or credit card (Liability) to the debtor, the debtor buys something. The seller acquires this liability and it clears it at the Buyers Bank (the bank that issued the loan) Now all banks know for a fact that that digital dollar is counterfeit. If banks were to agree to dispose of the concept of \u201cLiability\u201d and the \u201cLiability\u201d was independent of the issuing bank, then every and any Commercial Bank could just run up fictitious debt and enriched themselves and destroy the system.  \n \nSo the counterfeit liability is accepted so long as the issuing bank has the promissory note and ultimately takes responsibility. This is done when the debtor completes the payment on the loan and the promissory note vanishes. Now the bank has REAL money to neutralize the counterfeit liability electronic money it had issued.

There is a reason part of the map was named hind valley. \n\nSecond, if you are killing something that levels your skills at the same time as replenishing then that is a huge win. In other games you got basic xp. In UO there were skills you would level by doing them. Lumberjack, tailor, miner, parry, sword were some examples. If I farmed something that accomplished two things or more at once then I was making the best use of my time. \n\nThird, the original UO was PVP with corpse looting. You would almost always be better off to wear cheap farmable armor that is easy to replenish. That created a huge market for GM armor. More on GM armor later. \n\nPeople that didn\u2019t farm for resources would shop for gear.

Plus, if you were capped on say tailoring, then you could make grandmaster gear with slightly better stats. People would look for that gear vs non grandmaster gear. In order to be a grandmaster, you spent countless hours farming and crafting the same gear until you got enough skill points which at that time was 100.\n\nRegarding skills, you could craft armor and see no skill gain.

Seriously, early on we could cook and eat NPCs we killed. Technically, you could kill, chop up, cook, and eat real players too, but it was easier and more efficient to kill NPCs because they had the AI of a blueberry muffin. \n\nI remember players being really annoyed when Origin (that's the company, not EA's Steam-like digital platform) patched the game and no longer allowed using NPCs as \"walking meals.\" To be fair, Origin's reasoning was that killing and eating NPCs negatively affected the in-game economy as players needed to eat, so cooking food (one of the non-combat professions was cook or chef) for yourself or selling it was considered relatively important. \n\nBTW, remember the organs I mentioned earlier? My brother had inventory bags for each organ in his bank. There were bags that contained lungs, hearts, livers, intestines, etc. Why? Hell if I know, my brother was insane. He used to wear yellow robes and walk around proclaiming that the \"Cheeseman is our savior\" or some such nonsense while pickpocketing people. He wrote an entire book in-game about it. Yes, you could literally write in books, which was neat, but only crazy people actually put the time into writing anything lengthy. \n\nMy brother spent most of UO as a thief, which meant half the time he was dead (and thus respawned in plain, ugly gray robes after wandering around as a ghost) due to people screaming \"BUY THE BANK GUARDS!\" This was a macro people created to do everything important in a town while providing the greatest amount of security from people who'd attack or attempt to rob them. \n\nHe was also rich. He earned his fortune by stealing books from Lord British's library and then selling them to vendors. Yeah, that actually worked and made gold fast. \n\nWe have a lot of good memories of UO.

Even more veteran players would be hidden nearby waiting to kill the robbers, because they would incur no morale penalties for doing so, gaining the resources the robbers gained.

As the Communists swept south to Shanghai, the Green Gang and other criminal syndicates fled to Hong Kong; the Guomindang escaped to Taiwan.

Peasants were persuaded to plough in their opium crops and sow wheat or rice instead. Neighbourhoods were mobilised in a massive educational programme. The street committees which governed the neighbourhoods held study groups in which the evils of opium and heroin were discussed. Families of known addicts were educated not to blame their addict members, but to encourage them to seek help. Addicts themselves were impressed by the fact that they were not blamed for their addiction, since they were considered victims of foreign governments and other enemies of the people. After their cure, they were given training and then placed in paying jobs. Many of them were hired by the government to work with other addicts.\n\nAt the same time, pressure was placed on the dealers. Those who surrendered were accepted by the community, re-educated, trained for meaningful work and given jobs. The rest were packed off to prison, and the worst offenders were executed.

One has to first dive into the unique metal culture which still exists in Japan. Japan is a breeding ground for creative & unusual groups. \n\nWhich i have experienced first hand. From the gothic underground bands which defy all description. To the insane visual Kai bands. Which are a throw back to 80's glam rock in the west. The difference is that unlike the west Japan doesn't have stupid boundaries. Locking music into it's ridiculous genre roles.  \n\nWhich has kept music here stateside mostly generic & very conservative. You also see a lot of very talented girl bands in metal here. From Existtrance to DangerGang among others. Women in metal is already rare enough but Japan that devide seems less important. \n\nAs to what makes BabyMetal work is left to the fox god's to decide. This shouldn't work at all but somehow it does. Which no one but Japan could pull off. After seeing BabyMetal live though. As a former metal elist myself. I have to give major props what this group is attempting to do. \n\nMetal needs a Renaissance & someone willing to break down barriers. If it is to emerge from the ashes once again. This group is fantastic & deserves every bit of recognition it gets. Not only are they breaking down metal barriers. But helping to bring metal to an audience. \n\nWhich otherwise may have passed it up. The fact they are women only helps that in a metal industry on life support.

Sooner or later, human technology will stumble upon the fountain of youth but this will make people conflicted because now they are forced to decide on the most fundamental and arguably the biggest decision of their existence. Our lives were given to us by our parents, but now we have to decide if we want to take it away.\n\nImagine hating your mother for dying because she didn't 'choose' to live longer. Or, imagine your children hating you for living longer because they won't get your inheritance. In the past, we could blame death on ageing which takes individual choices out of the equation, but in the future, this may change. \n\nPersonally, I think people should be given a choice to extend their lives or die a natural death.

These are questions that everybody needs to think about and reflect on because it is what truly gives meaning to our lives. \n\n\"What am I living for?\"\n\"Why do I do this?\"\n\"Who will miss me when/if I'm gone?\"\n\"Was I such a terrible person that nobody will miss me when I'm gone?\"\n\nIf you think these questions are too hard and therefore you don't want to think about it, then you can choose to let ageing take you.

Newman\nCustomer Review\n5.0 out of 5 starsThe story of the story is critical\nBy Alan Dale on February 17, 2017\nFormat: Paperback|Verified Purchase\n\nThe publication of JFK and Vietnam in 1992 did more than create controversy and ignite a media firestorm. Its basic thesis that President Kennedy was opposed to sending U.S. combat forces to Vietnam and would have averted the terrible war and its consequences was denounced by some and applauded by others. The book was given sufficient thoughtful attention by a few which would change the nature and scope of the argument over what would he have done if he had lived. While being attacked (and defended) during the initial period following publication, it was singled-out and praised by former DCI William Colby and former special assistant to President Kennedy, Arthur Schlesinger, Jr., adding credibility to the idea that up until that time the story had never been presented with such detail, authority, or documentation. In 1992, JFK and Vietnam received high praise from Publisher's Weekly and Kirkus Reviews. It was featured and recommended on the front page of the New York Times Book Review. The book garnered nation-wide attention. For a time.\n\nThat time was cut short by the demonstrable suppression of the book by its publisher, Warner Books. After first surviving a very serious threat of intervention to block publication by a federal agency, within five months JFK and Vietnam was pulled from the shelves, found to be unavailable for purchase anywhere, and left its author unable to communicate with the publisher\u2019s representatives. They stopped returning his calls. Not since the Pentagon Papers had there been such an attempt to deny the American public access to a book about Vietnam. Without a serendipitous encounter between the author and a distinguished member of a distinguished American family, the story of the book itself might well have ended as abruptly as it began. It is our very good fortune that the story did not end there: the publisher returned the legal rights of the book to its author, and 25 years later we have JFK and Vietnam, second edition.\n\nJFK and Vietnam, second edition, should be publicized and promoted so that every student, every teacher, every citizen who volunteers for military service, and every aspiring politician will know the many false calculations, mistakes, manipulations, deceptions and intrigue which led to the Vietnam War. This essential work examines in detail the Shakespearean machinations of deception and counter-deception that took shape in the hidden maneuverings of a president who was determined to avoid being trapped and determined to never again repeat the mistakes of the Bay of Pigs. Dr. Newman documents President Kennedy\u2019s navigation of a dangerous course through Cold War hot spots and a very divided administration. What eventually emerges is an astonishingly dishonorable deception: a deliberate attempt to manipulate the President of the United States to authorize a war policy to which he was fundamentally opposed.\n\nThis is more than JFK and Vietnam. It is JFK and Laos; JFK and the Pentagon; JFK and the CIA; JFK and the National Security establishment as it evolved during the years preceding his election. The president recognized and responded to a clever adversary during the two years, ten months and two days of his administration, which acted\u2014within 48 hours of his violent death in Dallas\u2014to reverse his policy on Vietnam and throw America headlong into the tragic war that ensued.\n\nFive stars.

Most alcoholics get sober on their own, according to the largest study ever conducted by the NIH. The reason is similar to what this guy describes: AA demands too much effort. It works when a person is able to define their life as being about sobriety. But it comes at the expense of some of your other goals, your free time, your personal autonomy and identity, and the constant mental effort of \"living god's will.\" It's an enormous drain that asks more than most people are willing to give.\n\nRecovery does demand a lot more than abstinence. But personal growth can happen many ways. AA seems to work best for people who are conformist, social, and capable of religiosity. There aren't many good options outside of AA, so most of us just find our own path. I'm glad I did. I don't \"work\" to be sober. I work to improve my life because I want to, not because I have to.

It really puts everything into perspective. Our different atoms potentially coming from different exploding stars may simply be part of the universal grand design. The universe existing and working the way it does, is just too perfect. The universe is just too finely tuned. Considering all the constants within laws of physics, the cosmological constant, the ways strong forces interact with the weak forces etc,  the chances of the universe appearing by random chance is so astronomically small it is essentially impossible. If you were to alter any of these constants even by .000000000000001% the universe could not exist.  Mathematical physicist Roger Penrose explained the chances of the universe existing by chance by using the analogy of a creator armed with a pin. Each different positioning of the pin provides a different universe. Now the accuracy that is needed for the Creator\u2019s aim depends on the entropy of the universe that is thereby created. It would be relatively \u2018easy\u2019 to produce a high entropy universe, since then there would be a large volume of the phase space available for the pin to hit. But in order to start off the universe in a state of low entropy \u2014 so that there will indeed be a second law of thermodynamics \u2014 the Creator must aim for a much tinier volume of the phase space. Penrose's calculations lead him to the remarkable conclusion that the \u2018Creator\u2019s aim\u2019 must have been accurate to 1 part in 10 to the power of 10 to the power of 123, that is 1 followed by 10 to the 123rd power zeros.\u201d  Truly mind blowing.

Mereka (kelompok ttt yang mempunyai modal sangat besar :v) melihat Indonesia sebagai ladang emas,,harus bisa dikuasai ...coba deh amati kebijakan2 politik Skrno, arahnya ingin indonesia mandiri, berdikari, pro rakyat (rakyat secara keseluruhan), dia ga mau kompromi sama investor2 licik dari luar..makannya kelompok ini ga seneng sama skrno karena ga bisa cincai orangnya :v..jadi harus dibikin siasat untuk menggulingkan beliau..digunakanlah taktik kambing hitam,,yg paling pas kambing hitamnya ya komunis...fast forward..terus naiklah Shrto,,lalu apa yg terjadi? Investasi asing masuk gila2an, pembangunan harus dipercepat, kalo perlu hutang gapapa yg penting majuuuuu...sebenernya apa sih yang dibangun selama rezim shrto? Ya banyak sih, infrastruktur, lapangan kerja, segala macem..pertanyaannya itu semua punya siapa? Siapa pemegang kendali terbesarnya? Siapa yang paling diuntungkan dari itu semua? Kenapa nilai rupiah kecil sekali dibandingkan dolar dan mata uang lainnya? Kenapa harus tergantung sama kurs?

Komunis atau liberal? Hehe..gw juga kurang paham sih, tapi kayanya mau komunis kek mau liberal kek itu dua2nya kan cuma istilah atau teori doang..soalnya dua2nya kalo dipraktekin secara ekstrim gada yg bagus..ekstrimnya yg satu terlalu mengekang yg satu terlalu bebas..itu logika sederhana, itu keniscayaan lah, terus dibuat istilahnya...tapi yg jelas yg gw rasain di indonesia, negara udah kaya ga punya power ngatur ekonominya sendiri, udah terjerat dalem banget sama sistem yg nguasain sekarang, terus masyarakatnya juga mayoritas kurang cerdas..mungkin IQ nya sih oke lah, matematikanya jago2, bahasa asingnya juga banyak yg udah cas cis cus :v, udah canggih lah orang2nya..tapi common sense nya kurang banget..gampang banget disetir..udah gitu aja", 62], ["Sebentar lagi orang-orang tua ini akan mati, seperti Soeharto juga mati.

How amazing if Japan become like that!", 181], ["Married to a Jaoanese lived there 20 years, starting as a young teenager , went to japanese school, speak read and write japanese like any other japanese, I really love this country for so many reason starting with my art and my family in law which is very much related , but Japan is not a democracy, actually it is a democracy if you are japanese , and i mean by blood since japan only gives out citizenship if one can attest of its japanese lineage . except for very exceptional people and it usually costs them \u4e00\u5104\u5186so, approximately a million dollar. anyway this program is strange to me, I can't stand the gaijin who complain about not being able to read the language , what's the fuck is wrong with them, learn it guys it is not going to happen by magic , and if you can not read japanese you are very very limited and you actually know nothing about japanese culture, because anything that is genuine in japanese culture is written , It is like comparing TV news to newspaper, in Japan only stupid people watch TV news, smart people read the papers. But yes the society is weird, foreigners are mostly just mere exotic entertainment and should not expect more than that , unless you are ready to work very very hard and yet you will still not be considered quite as good as a national .\u00a0\nJapan is very safe in term of society , but that is also because you are constantly watched, especially as a foreigner, there is always someone, mostly neighbours who keep an eye on you, so privacy is a luxury that only a few can afford, unless you decide you just don't care being on someone's radar constantly. The japanese police could have given lessons to WW2 german gestapo , i mean if you are a foreigner in japan , for the police you are already somehow guilty of something. Mostly because the police is ruled by extremely patriotic actually nationalist activists who have a visceral hatred toward non japanese . so if you get arrested , you're in for some serious troubles. \u00a0you usually get checked most of the time on the street by the police in different areas especially the shinjuku , for no reason, just because you are a foreigner and this is legal in japan, and they actually want you to get excited so they can charge you with obstruction. this is really vicious . anyway japanese police is atrocious.\u00a0\nRacism is legal in japan so people should get ready for that, it is not punished by law, and it is felt several times a day if you have an active life .\u00a0\n\nas a white guy i feel very bad complaining about japan because my situation was nothing compared to my friends there from the Philippines, China, \u00a0Brazil, Iran, or Africa and Asia in general. I am from iceland japanese most of the time have no clue where the hell iceland is but if i say iceland is kind of a scandinavian country then i was very much considered as the elite in terms of ethnicity , in japan the whiter the better , just have a look at the geisha's make up or the concept \u7f8e\u767dor white beauty , just copy paste the kanji and check it out on google image .\u00a0\n\nJapan is not a democracy if you are about to go live their just keep that in mind. Japan is excellent at packaging and make everything look better than it is , and they have created a perfect illusion of democracy, mostly to attract the western market but this is just a lure . Japan doesn't even have animals protection laws , you can kill your dog or your neighbours dog you won't go to jail, Cats and dogs in japan become either pet or shamisen which is a traditional music intrument made with cat and dog skin ,\n\nIn japan money rules more than in america actually, and for the sake of making money there are no limits in japan especially tokyo and osaka and you must keep that in mind , because the only reason japan somehow tolerates gaijin is because they can make money out of them (us).\u00a0\n\nTo the guy who got his heart broken for not getting his kyoto machiya , I actually bought a kyoto nagaya next to gion, which was an old okiya , I was not granted the loan at first because i'm a foreigner the bank clerck clearly explained that being a foreigner was the reason though i made more money than the average japanese , but my mother in law who was already \u00a0retired at that time \u00a0, just had to come with me to the bank and i got the money .\u00a0\nMany japanese say , gaijin just come make money and leave , i actually went studied hard worked even harder made money and was ready to settledown, the reason i left is because the world freedom means nothing in japan, and no money in the world no greatest art and refine culture or polite smiles and bows can buy or get even remotely close to be worth given up on freedom.\u00a0\nthe only thing japan taught me was to keep my feelings for myself , and that is actually the only way to survive Japan, even maybe to eventually like it .\u00a0\n\nthe guy at 13:49 summed it all up in one sentence, Japan, it's all about the money. and that is so true , if you think you are unhappy in japan, you must realize that you are happier than most japanese, because most japanese have completely lost the meaning of the word happiness, they have a concept called \u5e78\u305bor shiawase \u00a0\u5b09\u3057\u3044or ureshi, which is their definition of happiness, one expresses a feeling of satisfaction , as in a need being satisfied , and the other describes gratitude toward someone , but none of them actually mean Happiness , because in japan being happy just by existing is weird, you can only be happy as a reward of some hard work or happy because someone did something for you or because you won something, but the idea of true happiness,  plenitude does not even exist and no one (japanese people) \u00a0really expects in japan to be happy , so being unhappy in japan is very natural , but you can buy satisfaction if you make money .\u00a0\n\ndamn i could write books on this country even years after i left i still feel , damn what an utter waste of time that was.\u00a0\nyou can see on the face of most of the foreigners who enjoy japan in that show that they would have never been really happy in their own country, so japan was some sort of second best for them, they hide being the money they make and how polite and beautiful the country is but look into their eyes , they are not happy , not at all, they just became shiawase like most japanese", 120], ["I came across this video by accident, but I watched it all the way through.

I am impressed how much those people have struggled to adjust to and try to understand a whole different environment, culture or society, but also how much they contemplate themselves and their surroundings in being in Japan, and how much they appreciate the traditional value of Japanese culture and the meanings implied behind which Japanese don't even know or realize. Now, I am studying in the US and I am grateful for being in this position because I can see my country I was born and raised in from the outside, and since I came here, I've found things about Japan that I got to feel blessed and appreciate much more but also things that I found strange, or need to be changed, both of which I could never have known if I had lived only in Japan.", 79], ["old guy in hat = creeper", 44], ["I'm an American who has lived in Japan for 40 years.

The breed standard for the Peke-faced Persian stipulates that the eyes, nose, and chin must be in vertical alignment. Human eyes are pushed back deeply into the skull and protected by a thick, heavy brow ridge, the cartilage of the nose is supported by a bony shelf that juts forward from the skull, and the chin has a ridge at the bottom that pokes forward as well, strengthening the key weak points of the human face. The Peke-faced Persian's eye sockets are paper-thin and provide almost no protection--it looks like a sharp blow from above could crush its eyes, or even cause brain damage.\n\nSometimes I wonder if the entire practice of competitive dog and cat shows should be banned, at least temporarily.

It's a shame that the comments on this video are so diverse. Consider, negative reinforcement has indeed been scientifically proven not to deliver the same lasting results as positive reinforcement!\n\nBeing dominant has nothing to do with training a dog or any animal for that part. Yes, It is very important to stay confident and assured when training or handling any animal but confidence and dominance are two different things. It\u2019s important to differentiate between the two! A healthy, balanced animal will never instantly result to aggression, unless it's for self-defense. If we, as dominant trainers, instantly respond aggressively to something our dog/ or whatever animal does, the animals first understanding to this aggressiveness will always be: self-defense! Which sets off the 'fight' or 'flight' reaction. Notice that 'do what you mean' is nowhere in those options. \n\nThe animal will not take that effort to 'think' about the trigger that set you off, and understand what you meant and \"forgive\" you for the stress, or look up to you because you \u2018won\u2019 or \u2018were right\u2019.  This is simply because animals don't think like humans. Animals react. There are universal set ways of reaction: called instincts. An animals reaction to a bad situation, again, is: stress, (nor)adrenaline release in the brain, and initiating of the fight or flight response. An animals basic reaction to something good: dopamine release in the brain, resulting in a general good feeling (even associated to addiction!). That is simply science, it is the way nature is, it is constant. All animals also have varying degrees of memory, so that is also to be incorporated.\n\nWe, humans, as a greatly evolved 'thinking' species, with our massive brain capacities, can (sometimes ;)) act beyond our instinctual reactions and actually THINK about the triggers that lead to these reactions. We know the basic 'goods' and 'bads' (ex: food/comfort, pain/stress) so we use them in training. It is our job to guide animals to a correct association of human interactions. \n\nSince more good experiences equals happier animals in general (just like us humans!), we should all just strive to use good triggers instead of bad ones to get an animal to do something. \nBeing dominant, thus evoking a stress reaction, is a quick and easy way of training that might work. \nBeing rewarding, whenever your animal does something right, and whenever it for chooses NOT to engage in bad behavior, might not be easy and time consuming, but will lead to more lasting effects (science!), more trust and happier animals, and don't we all want that?\nLike everything in life, it's the more difficult approach that makes it worth while.  It's up to us if we decide to be selfish or not.", 8], ["Caesar employs flooding techiques which can make the issue worse, and what airs on TV is of course edited.

No job or apartment awaited her once she was released, either.  What choices did she have other than to go to a homeless shelter?  Most women's shelters will not accept a woman unless she has been battered within the prior two weeks.  What else was there for her?  She must not have had any close personal friends who wanted to take her in.  If she had walked across the street for help, she likely would have ended up back at hospital, at a homeless shelter, or in jail as a result because she had nothing of her own and no one of her own to go home to.  \n\nMany people who have never been in a homeless type situation for one reason or another think that all sorts of options are available to the homeless, and this is simply untrue.  I know of no city that provides \"emergency housing,\" (recall Katrina for example) and all housing authorities have long, long waiting lists for housing assistance.  Even homeless shelters are very restrictive except during the coldest weather.  They usually will not accept homeless indoors before a certain hour of the evening, and they put the homeless back on the street at 6 a.m. in the morning.  Anyone who is homeless, ill, and without other resources on which to fall back is facing a very bleak existence indeed.  If I had been Linda Bishop, I do not know what I would have done.

One BIG thing that this woman's notebooks told me is that she would rather have stayed alone where she was than to have her freedom curtailed, to be burdened any further by institutions, doctors, nurses, nurses aids, therapists, medicines, and her even her own family.  I see a woman who held onto a fantasy of rescue by someone who was not coming to rescue her.  Is it so wrong to hold onto a fantasy of salvation?  If it is, we need to have some serious conversations with Christians, Jews, Muslims, and all the rest of that lot.  \n\nEveryone has his own fantasies, and who is anyone else to say they are unfair, silly, juvenile, or \"ill,\" or anything else? I found this woman to be intelligent, articulate, observant, and even humorous.  Maybe in a different culture she would not have been considered \"ill\" at all.  Her only testimony was in her notebooks.  She told us a lot in them, but think how much more she might have been able to tell given the right circumstances with sympathetic interlocutors.  \n\nNo, I do not blame the hospital, and I do not blame the court.  In fact, I think both institutions acted fairly and in accordance with good and JUST laws.  How many more artists of all kinds, thinkers, philosophers, etc., would be deemed \"ill\" in today's world, by today's standards?  How do we know that the rest of us are not the ones who are \"ill\" and Linda was the sane one, mistakenly awaiting a real spiritual saviour that never arrived, a type of spiritual salvation in fact, that churches and other religious groups continue to preach to everyone every day and twice on Sunday?

While \"Sinnesl\u00f6schen\" is really an artistically made-up (German language can be used to create nearly infinite new word creations, that is why we sometimes have crazy long words; best example for this would be language for administrational uses) but clearly understandable German word, translating directly to \"deleting senses\" (100% correct translation), the word \"sinnlosen\" (plural) or in its singular form \"sinnlos\" just is a totally common word in German, with the literal translation to \"senseless\" but rather used in an alternate translation: If you want to say, somebody didn't think about a certain thing, resulting in a stupid outcome you call this behavior \"sinnlos\", which means \"mindless\". The text at 43:46 is translated to: Logology - The first religion of the cyber-age. Brutallity, brain destruction and demonization are the biggest threats of this mankind; therefore, we avow ourselves strictly to proscribe [these threaths]... Logology is an contemporary religion of common sense. It is free of demonization and has a lot in common with buddhism. Its essence is the aboslute proscription of brutality and mindless brain destruction. Its main goal is the preservation and advancement of mankind, through instruction in autonomous-holistic thinking. --- Then there are some links to the FAQ section and more in-depth descriptions about the topic. This transaltion was made without the help of a translation software and resembles the exact meaning of the text, with the right words in place.

When they dispersed and the fog cleared, I went inside and checked on the well being of everyone. \n\nEverything was cool, minus the one guy bleeding a lot from a broken nose, but he refused an ambulance.

I had to run and tackle her before she made it that far and got killed while her family was busy yelling at me. I went back to my car and got a bunch of zip tie cuffs and went to arresting everyone. I intended to charge them all with, among other charges, interfering with my duty, which is a felony here.

Instead of 'explaining' the subject of the video fairly, they take a political stance on the subject. In this case leftisim states that monagamy is a western patriarcal structure that oppresses people and therefore it is bad and must be abolished. Its kinda sad that prior to even watching the video, one can know vox's political stance and then make a pretty accurate guess on the content of the video. Since radical leftists use the same lens to describe everything, their arguements are extremely predictable.\n\nWhat they dont ever state is perhaps why mongamy is good for society. Well here are some facts for you to consider. Monogamy is not natural. This is true, and the video states this as such, however, through the biological / evolutionary justifications they video presents for a lengthy portion, they infer that polyarmory is the 'natural' way of doing things, and this lends to it some legitamacy. This is the naturalistic fallacy, where just because something is natural is not sufficient justification for why something is good. Chimps are extremely tribal creatures and roam forests looking for other chimp tribes to tear apart, viciously i might add. Yet we do not think this is right, despite it existing in nature. In the same vein, polyarmory comes with it some consequences. Notice how the video never stated how long do polyarmarous relationships last on average. Notice how all developed societies promote monogamy, as opposed to only primitive tribes living in small groups are able to sustain polyarmory. With the scale to which human socieities have grown, polyarmory becomes unsustainable. Why might this be? Goin further, what about the children in this situation. Studies show that the nuclear family results in the best enviroment for children to grow up in, vs single mothers who are 70% in poverty on average. Polyarmory only encourages more deadbeat fathers to leave their children. \n\nLike everything in life, sex is unequal, and monogamy is a social solution to this inequity. Women only ever date up in terms lf socioeconomic status, and this is true cross culturally. Therefore, throughout history, women were almost always able to procreate, and unfortunately many low status men were tossed to the way side. On the flipside those are at the top had a monopoly on the women (think kings and emperors who had extremely large families). The problem with this is that when you have too many people stacked at the bottom, social unrest and violence occur, and this inhibits progress. Studies have shown that past socieities with enforced monogamy had less male violence then those without. Clearly, some how in the past, our socieities realized monogamy was a way to correcting these issues. Competition would end after a single mate, and fathers didnt have to worry about raising a child that they were not sure was theres. This social system allowed socieity to compete in terms of economic status and avoid some uncessairy conflict that would no doubt hamper our ability to co-exist in such large communities. \n\nNow this all being said, the advent of contraceptives and women in the work place changes the equation immensely, and perhaps polyarmpory is sustainable today. I dont know, nor do i care. Like i said before, what annoys me the most is how onesided and idealogical this video is, while having the audacity to title itself as 'explain' when numourous studies have shown there are two sides to this issue.

DOS is in no way a part of Windows since 1993 and definitely not since 2001. Let's remember that Windows started as a graphical environment for DOS. In 1993, Microsoft created a new beast called Windows NT, completely independent of DOS. It was mostly intended for the enterprise market and it gradually drew design inspirations from Unix. To make the difference even more obvious, NT was using its own kernel instead of relying on that of DOS like 95, 98 and ME did. The command prompt we see nowadays is just a shell for running Batch commands and that's what it always has been. Nothing more, nothing less. Batch as a shell is implemented in DOS, Wine and Windows. The reason why MS still keeps it around is to support legacy scripts that didn't migrate to PowerShell. The most obvious giveaway of Windows NT not having DOS is the fact you can't run certain DOS software in NT-based versions of Windows, despite Microsoft's best efforts to provide compatibility layers. Best I can think of is SimCity 2000 and Quake. These games are written for DOS with absolutely no memory management in mind, so the NT kernel will rightfully stop them as they will try to access memory that was not provisioned to them by the kernel in a legitimate manner.", 80], ["No mention of how it was changed to IDCLIP?

I can\u2019t deny that some of this young people were working in those plantations just to earn money so that they could support the financial needs of their family. I am very disappointed that those children were refused to feel the love, security and the rights that they have. At the young age of 6-17, they must be in school and learning some educational stuff, enjoying their childhood days and not in those plantations holding bolo and sacks because I think this stage is the very crucial stage of a child. Why? It is because during these days of their life they might formulate an idea that this kind of work is normal that they could send also their future children for this kind of illegal activity and let them suffer also. We can\u2019t tell that these abuses they have suffered/experienced might lead into a trauma which this trauma could be dangerous for themselves and for the lives of others.\n\r\nI can\u2019t stop myself for thinking how these traffickers could be that selfless enough to put these young people in that kind of vain. Maybe the reason is that they are not educated enough which they were refused to get a job. So, if they don\u2019t have a job they will force themselves to engage in illegal activities to support their daily needs or maybe some traffickers engaged themselves in this illegal activities because they are just attaining highest material satisfaction. But whatever reasons they have, it is still not right to disobey the Republic Act No. 9231 which according to the law it is an act providing for the elimination of the worst forms of child labor and affording stronger protection for the working child, amending for this purpose republic act no. 7610, as amended, otherwise known as the \"Special Protection Of Children Against Child Abuse, Exploitation And Discrimination Act\" because they are turning their brighter future into darker future.\n\r\nI may not have the right to judge but I think the persons that are responsible for this child-labor is no other than the parents, the government, citizens and of course the businessman. It is because as a Filipino student, I believe that if the parents were responsible enough they will be the one who will work for the family and they will ensure the brighter future for their children and their safety.

The story, told by an interesting voice, requires some rectifications for the sake of historical and technical accuracy.\n\nThe 114 was not only the fastest propeller airliner. It was - and still is - the fastest propeller driven aircraft in history, with a top speed of 540 mph (this record stands since 1961). Some sources claim it was the Republic XF-84H. The 84H was designed to be faster than the Tu-114; but it was not able to fly beyond 520 mph according to the Smithsonian.\n\nAlso the 114 was not the noisiest aircraft, nor its military siblings Tu-95/142. That distinction belongs to the same XF-84H which was called \"Thunderscreech\" by the Muroc Air Force Test Base personnel, who were made sick (vomit) by the sound of the aircraft's running propeller during ground runs. Watching the ground personnel around the Tu-95s and 142s, it is evident they are not in discomfort. Same applied to the 114 which had about 2000 hp less powerful engines and propellers.\nThe claim that it had to cruise at lower speeds due to noise and vibration is not accurate. Actually it is the first time I ever heard of it. I flew one window ahead of the inner propellers tips. Technically that was the noisiest place inside the aircraft. It was not as quiet as a Bristol Britannia (the Whispering Giant); but it was quieter than the Super Connie shown in the video (I also flew in both).\nIn fact, after almost an hour over the Artic Circle, I was bored and noticed a faint vibration that ran along the window sill like a very low frequency, mini-amplitude wave, passing every four or five minutes from front to rear like a distant slow rumble. My neighbour did not notice it; but my newly minted engineer's degree, wanted to show-off and kept searching for an explanation that never arrived, and soon I fell asleep. It was that boring.  Its safety record of only one accident - on the ground - after decades in service, testifies that there were no structural issues with the original design. \nOf course, the military version, without the civilian cabin insulation must be noisier; but again the videos on this site do not show any crew member sick nor close to deafening distress.\n\u00a0\nTo this day, in my strong (not humble) opinion, backed by almost 70 years of Aviation love, I think that the Tu-95 and the SR-71 are the most exotic aircraft to ever fly.", 1041], ["\"My plane is bigger than your plane\" \"My nuke is bigger than your nuke\" \"We got to space first\" \"We got to the moon first\" \"We invaded Afghanistan\" \"Oh yeah, watch this\" \n\nI love how the Cold War reminds me of being a child.", 967], ["This is a 2M+ subscribers worth content.

When those people who find it safer to exist outside of family begin to speak up about the flaws in the family's leadership, or the family's culture, it is a natural thing for the members of the family who have not needed to leave the family in order to survive, to close ranks and defend the family and those in power over the family, even though they themselves may have serious reservations about the value of family's culture or the family's leadership.\r\n\r\nThe vested interest in maintaining the family is an instinctual connection with the herd that overpowers their need to address the problems in their family. Problems are violently suppressed, and not because there is no awareness of real issues in family, but because there is such an investment in family that they cannot comfortably do anything they feel might threaten the family's continued survival and thriving.\r\n\r\nOf course, when one subjectively suppresses attempts at dealing with and addressing the flaws in society, they are in fact sabotaging the wellbeing of the very family they are so ferociously, so emotionally defending. But this is almost always completely lost on those still sitting snuggly within the walls of the family structure.\r\n\r\nThose within the walls of the family structure are not inherently evil people. They are simply ordinary subjective humans. We are all subjective humans. And it is only the inability to survive within the family structure that generates the freedom from the subjectivity that naturally keeps the rest of us blinded to the flaws in our system, that liberates them to be able to see through the subjectivity constraining everyone else. These restless ones are not possessed of greater virtue. They are simply less dependent upon the system that needs badly to be questioned, and thus more free to question it.\r\n\r\nThe media that a society produces does not need to be collared and silenced by an elite group of magnates. It is already collared by the instinctual dependency upon the family/social structures they were taught to defend from day one. Suppressive forces are marshaled not by a cabal of elites, however much the magnates of the earth do collaborate on political agendas. These suppressive forces arise from within those who have a vested interest in the maintenance of the social structure.\r\n\r\nWe cannot freely question our parents, so we cannot freely question our leaders. We cannot freely question our own individual intentions, so we cannot freely question the intentions of our society. This dynamic is primarily a psychological one, not a political one. Politics comes at the ass-end of change in human society. Politics is the last thing to change. Politics is the manifestation of the psychosocial dynamics of the human experience of family.", 6], ["surprise surprise, they tried to set up Chomsky to be some kind of NAZI sympathiser in order to smear him.

As they get older and become more independent, the balance can shift further to letting them make more of their own choices.

My son has Autism", 38], ["I worked as an ABA therapist for 4 years, I even became an assistant behavior analyst, but eventually left ABA  because of the burn-out I felt (my first passion was Occupational Therapy but I settled for ABA at the time). It was rewarding to work with children with autism, but on the other hand I felt an internal dilemma because of some of our methods. \nFor example self-stimulatory behaviors were something we immediately tried to eliminate, but for me it felt cruel to block them from engaging in something that was self-soothing, even though ABA considers it \u201cnon-functional\u201d and therefore not beneficial in any way. But the reality is EVERYONE engages in some self-stimming. Tapping your foot, twirling your fingers, rocking in a chair. Just because its \u201cnon-functional\u201d doesn\u2019t make it abnormal.\nOn the other hand, I could see how it could be a problem. Some kids engaged in \"stim\" behaviors all day long, making it difficult for them to learn or stay focused on anything else. Some would be oblivious to dangers around them. They would run away from caretakers in public places just to stim which can be extremely dangerous because they could run right into traffic, etc. so I understood why we worked on reducing it, but I thought we should teach them when they could stim and when they shouldn't, instead of trying to eliminate the behavior all together. \nWe would also force them to engage in eye-contact, sometimes physically using our hands to block their gaze from looking anywhere else but in the eyes of whoever they\u2019re talking to. Many parents would express their concerns about how their child \u201cwon\u2019t even look at me\u201d so it was something we constantly worked on, and unfortunately that was how we increased that behavior. The problem is I\u2019ve heard how uncomfortable it can be for people with autism to make eye-contact, which made me want to avoid forcing them to do it. Only because it was a \u201csocially significant\u201d behavior did therapist continue to work on it and feel it was necessary.\nI don\u2019t want to sound like ABA is completely terrible. I believe the pros far outweigh any cons. I saw tremendous improvement in many of the kids we worked with. We helped them learn everything under the sun: how to speak, count, read and write, bathe themselves, brush their teeth, tie their shoes, use eating utensils, color and paint and be creative , dress themselves, cross the road safely, we potty-trained them, taught them how to ASK FOR HELP and how to say NO and NO, THANK YOU (complete compliance was not the only thing we taught them despite what many ABA adversaries say), how to use their words (if possible) instead of just whining and crying and eventually resorting to aggression. We helped parents deal with tantrums until they decreased significantly or no longer occurred. We reduced aggression and self-injurious behaviors, like head-banging and self-biting. We did all this while getting slapped, kicked, scratched, hair-pulled, cussed at just because we presented simple tasks like \"write your name\" or \"lets play ball with a friend\". But we did it because we knew it was for their benefit, as well as everyone else around them.\nWith all this being said I still think ABA has got a long way to go. There needs to be more acceptance and understanding, not just in the ABA profession but in society overall. Instead of pushing children to behave in a way that is \u201csocially acceptable\u201d WE also need to be more accepting of people who are neurologically different, while also doing everything possible to help them become self-sufficient and independent individuals.\nThe scene with Richard broke my heart and further solidifies my reasons for leaving. It clearly affected him emotionally but his therapist brushes it off and says \"he doesn\u2019t remember anything from that period.\u201d It\u2019s a shame that a therapist believes a child doesn\u2019t have any recollection of intensive therapy when they were 3. I worked with many therapists who had this kind of mentality even though they had good intentions. It is one of the many reasons why I decided ABA just wasn\u2019t for me. ABA has come a long way since the 60's and 70's, but there is still a lot of room for improvement.", 32], ["why would you kiss a child that hits you? tell him\u200b don't do that, then show him love after you have corrected him.", 32], ["I have autism and adhd.

What is most terrible is that this is only a small part of Canada which is only a small part of an entire planet and this is going on everywhere. It is the same with the women. \nMost people don't like to hear this and true it is not 100% of the time but much of this slide into hell is rooted in childhood experience. It is not a given but not to be overlooked.\nI had a very advantaged but brutal childhood and I did not sell my body. Only because I was too inhibited when the offers for porno or private call service came. I was terrified of hard drugs as I already had a drinking and prescription medication dependency at 15. I was well educated and materially had everything. But also a verbally abusive mother who was probably bi polar and a string of miserable step fathers. At 22 I tried to end my life. After that I encountered someone who led me on onto a different path and was able to turn my life around. But it is not easy and doesn't work for everyone. \nI worked with many alcoholics and drug addicts earlier in my life and why some actually recover and make new lives and others don't remains a mystery to me. I've known people who have breathtaking good looks, become rich, famous and they end up on drugs and killing themselves. Some people's wounds and pain are insurmountable. Others do not encounter possibly the one person who can use the right words to shake them out of themselves. It is a very complex situation and those who see this and judge with nasty hate and intolerance simply lack intelligence, insight  and understanding.\nAlthough I have had what some call an exciting and extraordinary life. But it has neither been easy nor wholly successful according to the western world's standards. I don't consider myself better than these lads because I did not fall down as deep a black hole and that I ultimately moved into the light. I was just lucky with the kind of brain that clicked when I was presented with a way out and chose it. But I was never as far down as these lads, had I been and without people who tried to help it is unlikely that I would be here today.\nThere are two points, our world as it now functions is not for every soul and yet there are no easy alternatives out of the blood sucking aggressive capitalistic slavery that has spread like a cancer over the planet. \nSecondly too many people have children that simply shouldn't. They don't provide what a child really needs and so that child cannot flourish. And it has nothing to do with material possessions. \nIf in the animal kingdom the parents were as incompetent as most humans have been the young would die out quickly in the wild. A mother cheetah, tiger etc teaches skills for survival. If that mother is great at it her young have a far greater chance of survival. But the skills needed to not only exist but Live for humans is much more complex in the world as it is now.", 162], ["Broken souls from broken families and homes.

This was done on the logic that even a sadistic, fascistic, ultra-nationalist dictatorship was better than a communist-inclined government. Witness the logic of Cold War politics.\n\nSaddam invaded Iran because he feared that the Shia revolution would spread to Iraq (Iraq is majority Shia, Saddam ruthlessly persecuted the Shia majority within his own country). The United States supported him in this endeavour, largely because the overthrown Iranian dictator had been their strongest ally in the region. The USA sold arms to both sides in this war, which lasted 8 years and took over 800,000 lives.\n\nSaddam invaded Kuwait because they had started producing larger quantities of oil, and had flooded the market causing a large decrease in the price Saddam could sell Iraqi oil for; this crippled Iraq's already war-torn economy. Since he was used to being America's favourite pet, it's no surprise that he thought they would remain neutral. However, the end of the cold war (fall of berlin wall, collapse of USSR etc) meant the US now had no need for him, and he was increasingly becoming an embarrassment.\n\nJust after the end of the First Gulf War, when Saddam was arguably at his weakest, the USA refused to support an attempted uprising, largely Kurdish and Shi'ite, which would have almost certainly overthrown him. Despite encouraging the uprisings, which many in Iraq saw as a subtle promise of assistance, the USA refused to intervene, and even allowed Saddam to fly 'civilian' helicopters over US-controlled regions (anyone with any brains knows these were being used to spy on, and organise retribution against, the would-be rebels).\n\nThe USA, along with a large portion of the international community then imposed sanctions on Iraq during most of the 90s, something which certainly killed hundreds of thousands of innocent civilians, and arguably made them even more dependent on Saddam.\n\nSaying the USA is 'responsible' for all of this would be stupid, it would take away the responsibility from the people who really perpetrated these horrors. However, it is important to remember that the USA was perfectly happy for these atrocities to be carried out for the sake of 'stability in the region'; it was only when the USA no longer had a need for him that their labeling of him changed to 'ruthless dictator' and 'dangerous tyrant'.\n\nThe USA and the UK then used the popular political momentum of the 'War on Terror' within their own countries to remove Saddam from power.", 16], ["even if saddam kills with this bare hands any of your Muslim brothers & sisters front of you...you'll say that it was not saddam...bec you muslims choose to see evil done by your people as an act of Allah's will...\u00a0", 10], ["History's written by the winners.", 10], ["Biased?

They ran it for one night, repeatedly. The short films featured had won awards at film festivals or something like that. I barley remember anything about it and can't find any information on it. \r\n\r\nOne of the short films was so striking that it's stayed with me to this day almost 24 years later. It had a modern style of animation. It was very minimalist, done with just a few simple black lines that create shapes and impressions without details. A man in a suit sitting at a desk, a picture of his family on the desk. A Southern or African American narrator (He has a draw) talks about him and his life. \r\n\r\nThe man finds a chord attached to his foot, and yanks on it. He's never noticed it before, but he notices it goes down the hallway. He follows it gathering it up as he walks. It leads him to an actual wall outlet where he's apparently plugged in. He pulls the plug from the wall, everything fades to white, and the narrator says something like \"And no one ever heard from him again\". \r\n\r\nThis was troubling to me as a kid, and I've often thought about it when life seems weird and existentially strange to me.

Bengt relentlessly insisted that they stay out late, and that she have sex with his friends, promising that once the fun was over, she could go home to the children.

But when he hit her again, I grabbed his arm and pleaded with him to stop. He hardly noticed my presence, nor did he seem to care that anyone was watching. \n\u200b\nIn time, Elisabeth\u2019s bruises went away. Banners declaring Bengt\u2019s eternal love were hung on the walls. It seemed like the honeymoon was just beginning. But soon enough, the abuse began again, even more brutally than before.  Elisabeth hired a lawyer who helped her obtain a restraining order. She divorced him, gave him the house, and moved away with her children to a more modest home. Bengt did not provide child support. Through the help of friends during the transitional period, and after a long time studying to be a reflexologist and shiatsu practitioner, Elisabeth finally was able to bring a sense of order back into her family life.

Enjoy the ride.\n\n0) The Foreword\n\nI highly suggest watching Isolation - Mind Field (Ep 1) by Vsauce  (here on YouTube) and draw your own conclusions. \nIn that video we have a guy that tries to stay sane for 3 days in solitary confinement. Sure, the experimental conditions/setup are different but there are many parallels and the most intersting part: How do both individuals deal with their \"peril\" and how is their well being affected throughout/after their adventure.\n\n\n\r1) The Sun\n\nA crucial aspect of our body to functioning properly is the link between our intrinsic clock and the extrinsic clock of the sun.\r\n\r\nIn case of living in the VR you could clearly see that the test person quickly seeked out a place in VR where he could experience the sun (yoga) and later strived for a day/night cycle in Skyrim. A lack of an exterior clock completly throws of your cyrcadian rythm (you being synchronized with solar time). \r\nThis has a significant impact on all kinds of biological activities within your body.\r\n\r\nEssentially, your body doesnt know when to up and downregulate the activity of single cells, neuronal networks, and your body as a whole. You loose the grip on reality because you can not experience time without a reference point. Being in a room with no sun and to a lesser effect with no clock slowly shifts your assessment of how much time actually has passed. You do not know when you \"should\" sleep and when to be awake and active. After 1 day you will start to have trouble falling asleep leading to additional psychological stress.\r\n\nIn general, your entire body is just going crazy. Like consuming energy drinks while simultaneously taking a sleep pill (do not do this at home!).\nThere is nothing that governs the activity of your body resulting in physical and psycholigcal stress.\n\nSummary: Distress +10 level, sleep disorder +1 level\n\r\n\r\n2) An Entertainers Nightmare: The Brain\n\r\nYour mind needs entertainment! \n\nPeople are different, however each one of us will experience boredom after a given amount of time has elapsed.\nMaybe like reading this piece of\r text. Some continue to read some dont.\n\n\nDuring extended solitude you can try to trick your brain for some time by performing mental exercises but ultimately the result will be the same: Boredom.\r\nThus, everyone is doing something that keeps their brain in the loop. Even simple things like binge watching Netflix or YouTube serves this point.\r\nYour brain is constantly working in the background, processing thoughts even when you think you are doing nothing.\n\r\nThe endless options you have in VR to cater to your brain's entertainment significantly helps you to stay \"sane\".\r\nIn this video you see the subject seek out sport activities, mental tasks  and outher activities such as video games, gardening, watching movies and interacting with other human beings.\n\nNot having this option leads to a quick cognitiv decline, up to the point where you will start having trouble doing basic maths in your head. You start to lose your creativity and your drive as a human being. In that sense, the brain is like a muscle. If you dont use it it will be less effective.\n\nCongratulations! \nInitial stage of depression aquiered.\nSummary: Distress +15 level, sleep disorder +1 level, depression +1 level\n\nFun fact: Astronauts do workout in space so their muscles show no sign of regression. Otherwise they would need a wheelchair when they are back on earth and are exposed to earth's gravity.\r\n\n\n3) Your Best Friend: The Humans\n\r\nHumans need other humans to feel well. \r\nSome of us need more \"exposure\" to other humans than others. But it is a highly significant  difference if you have no interaction with others at all.\n\nAgain, the majority of human beings have an inner sense to be valued in a community (in a broader sense, a gaming community is also applicable here) and that their actions are being valued by other people. Sure there are also people living in solitary but thats a topic for another time.\r\n\nOther human beings \"serve\" as the best entertainers for our brain because we are similar (in a broader biological sense, excluding DNA differences) and are able to listen, evaluate as well as give a response to someone else brain output (thoughts, comments, jokes etc.) via speech.\r\n\nDepriving humans of other human interactions comes close to torture. For more information on this topic read into psychological analysis of humans kept in solitary confinement.\r\nAnalysing the behaviour of our test subject in this video shows that the individual quickly tried to establish a connection to other humans. Watching a space shuttle/rocket rise into the air is more fun if you have other people arround you. Talking to humans about the implications of VR is feeding your brain with new stimulations for your own thoughts.\r\n\r\nThe biggest aspect of all of this is the word \"new\", since the brain on its own is not good at breaking out of loops. If you feel bad (break up, trauma etc.) talking to someone else is sometimes already enough to get you back on track. The person you are talking to does not even have to respond to you in a significant way.\r\n\nIf you have no one arround you and by that I mean literally no one, like Hikikomori in Japan (Adults who completely withdraw from social life) you can become out of touch with reality.\nThis adds up ontop of your psychological distress. Maybe you come up with an immaginary friend.\nBy the way, Mr. Wilson was the MVP in the movie 'Cast Away', starring Tom Hanks.\n\nSummary: Distress +10 level, sleep disorder +1 level, depression +1 level, schizophrenia +1 level, apathy +1 level, anxiety +1 level, neurosis +1 level.....\nWell, you are a bag of meat sitting in a room and you more or less lost the energy to go on living as a human being.\n\r\n\n4) Final note\n\r\nAfter the subject took of the VR headset his first reaction was to smile and to go outside. Breath fresh air (for him city air is as fresh as it gets) acknowledge the beauty of nature as well as observe other human beings with his newly aquired perception. He has a whole new appreciation for the world arround him, even the small things.\r\nHe changed and by that I do not mean in a negative way. Just simply changed.\r\n\nIn case of VSauce and his voluntary solitary confinment the thing he missed the most was to talk/interact with other humans (based on his own post experiment interview).\n\nBy comparing these two experiments I conclude that human interactions play a crucial role for our well being and that VR can combat the decline of your brain by providing an artificial day/night cycle, human interactions as well as a variaty of activities to keep your brain entertained. This inevitably results in a less prominent decline of his physical/mental state and overall well being.\n\nThe topic at hand is very complex and there are many additional aspect which could be analysed, but it is clear that the individual in this video is trying to live as close to reality as possible. And whenever he feels like he is \"loosing\" it he tries something new to keep his brain fresh and juicy.\r\n\n\nP.s.: I had a lot of fun writing this although in a rather spontaneous manner, therefore overall structure and spelling might be wonky at times.\nI hope you enjoyed entertaining your brain by reading this.\n\nCheers", 396], ["6:20 what about that VRchat philosopher with an anime avatar", 375], ["\"I thought the earth was flat\" - Some guy meditating in VR 2019", 244], ["Nobody:\n\n\nParents: 1 Hour!?

On top of that, all of his methods were humane. He used wooden stakes so that the croc wouldn't injure himself when it thrashes. The only bait he used was an invasive species of wild pig that harrasses these crocs' nests. He didn't sedate the salty because of the potential dangers to the croc's life.

The VOC was never the main contributer to the Dutch economy. Non-European trade (which included the spice, slave and fur trade) might at most have only made up 10% of the Dutch economy. Most of our economy came from a trade system called the \"Moedernegotie\" (roughly translated as \"Mother of all trade\"), which was a trade connection between the Dutch Republic and the Hansaetic League and other traders around the Baltic Sea. The Netherlands was able to import raw materials and basic foodstuff from the Baltic area which allowed Dutch cities and farmers to focus on products which could sell for a lot of profit overseas, like linen, ceramics and cheese. \n\n2. The Netherlands wasn't a backwater in this period, and already consisted of a lot of merchant cities. The problem was that most of the rural areas in Holland, Zeeland and Friesland were swampy which didn't allow for a large agricultural output. After they implemented the water reclaimation system (which wasn't financed by the VOC only but probably different sources) Dutch agricultural output exploded.\n\n3. The biggest contributer to the VOC's failure was the implementation of protectionism by most seafaring powers. Because the naval powers were able to consolidate their colonies they put up tariff walls which effectively blocked the Dutch and Hansaetic Germans from operating inside colonial nations.

The original Hellraiser movie has always been one of my favorites. It captures the atmosphere of horror film making in the 80s so well, it's just so... \"gritty\" in the best way. And Clive Barker's relationship with the franchise is fascinating as well. I think it says something about the relationship between horror literature and horror film, the clash between the freedom that writing allows from agencies like the MPAA, which your opinion of is pretty clear in this video, and the great power and allure that visual media holds for artists. \n\nIt makes me wonder how the series would have looked unrestricted. Probably better in certain ways, but as you mentioned Clive seems to struggle a bit condensing his more literary ideas into a format suitable for film. Maybe the whole thing would have gone off the rails from the beginning. I'm sure it would have been fascinating regardless. \n\nThe whole thing about the middle of the franchise being mostly filler/advertisements for future reboots of the series is fascinating as well. You mentioned that several of the films were created pretty much just to keep the rights from reverting back to Clive. I'm not sure what to think about that. It seems like the series didn't have that much monetary value at that point in its life, but I guess they still recognized how much of a following it had and what potential there was if they were to ever actually put some money into a reboot. \n\nI wonder what Hellraiser would look like if it was made in today's culture. Without the baggage of the last 30 years of Hellraiser movies. Although now that I think of it I'm not sure it would be recognizable. The themes of sexuality, spirituality and morality in the original film I would argue are really inextricably linked to the culture of the late 80s in the USA. The country was in the grips of both the AIDS Epidemic and Satanic Panic, perhaps it was the perfect time for this film with this director to be made. \n\nAgain thanks so much for the work you put into these videos.

Alas, I haven't been able to view all the films in the franchise, but you show such energy, interest and insight into the first few entries.  You realize, particularly in discussing the first film, what the producers, studios, etc., who perpetuate such a franchise often forget: that the successful first film in many series is often very good because it's so intimate.  While it's always the Cenobites people discuss, HELLRAISER really started (as actor Andrew Robinson once said in an interview) as a sort of domestic tragedy steeped in supernatural overtones.  (In this sense, the first movie's effects echo what Rod Serling did on THE TWILIGHT ZONE and NIGHT GALLERY: it concentrates on the people, and all the evil that unfolds directly relates to the characters' motivations.  As Julia slowly overcomes her revulsion and does what she must to regenerate Frank, we may be horrified, but we've already felt her profound unhappiness and understand what it is that drives her, and that's a tribute to Clive Barker's script as much as it is to Clare Higgins' wonderful performance.  As much as I enjoy HELLRAISER and Doug Bradley's unforgettable portrayal of Pinhead, when I think of the movie I overwhelmingly think of Frank and Julia, its incredible dialogue, and the sometimes queasy premise we're subjected to from beginning to end.  In any event, I found it an incredible experience due to its intimacy, and the way the budget's and era's constraints on Barker's work concentrated it to a degree.  You're right: pre-CGI (and even now, in an era rife with CGI) showing what Barker imagines in terms of story, character and imagery tends to be so epic that there's no realistic way to convey it.
