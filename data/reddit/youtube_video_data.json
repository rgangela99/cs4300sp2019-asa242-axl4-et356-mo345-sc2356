Driven by a personal interest in the First World War, Jackson set out to bring to life the day-to-day experience of its soldiers. After months immersed in the BBC and Imperial War Museums\u2019 archives, narratives and strategies on how to tell this story began to emerge for Jackson.

The transformation from black and white footage to colourised footage can be seen throughout the film revealing never before seen details. Reaching into the mists of time, Jackson aims to give these men voices, investigate the hopes and fears of the veterans, the humility and humanity that represented a generation changed forever by a global war.\n\nThe film can be seen in both 2D and 3D in selected cinemas.

Legend has it that on one particularly dry afternoon in 1657, a priest made the deadly mistake of burning an unlucky kimono.

That\u2019s when the military shogunate system that had ruled for almost 700 years ended. A new government led by a young emperor finally made Edo the official capital of Japan, renamed it Tokyo, and made the castle his imperial palace. To celebrate his arrival, everyone toasted with rounds of sake on the house.\n\nAround this time Japan opened up to foreign trade and influence, with Tokyo driving the industrial revolution that was modernizing the country.

As firestorms engulfed whole neighborhoods, some took advantage of the chaos to target political enemies and minority groups, like Koreans. When the smoke finally cleared, 140,000 people had perished.\n\nJust twenty-two years later, in 1944, Tokyo was hit again.

Michael immediately found himself at the centre of a media storm and at the mercy of America\u2019s notoriously harsh justice system. How did a young, middle class boy from suburban England, who suffers from Asperger\u2019s, end up thousands of miles from home?

You can contact me in order to answer all of your questions by means of an interview (I\u2019m proficient in Dutch and English), or to invite me to a film festival.\n\nTo use this video in a commercial player or in broadcasts, please email licensing@storyful.com\n\ncontact@anthonyvdmeer.nl\nanthonyvdmeer.nl\n#FMP\nDutch version can be found here: https://vimeo.com/191763814\nGerman dubbed version: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5x7eE7xxmJU"}, "defaultAudioLanguage": "nl"}, "contentDetails": {"duration": "PT21M30S", "dimension": "2d", "definition": "hd", "caption": "true", "licensedContent": false, "projection": "rectangular"}, "statistics": {"viewCount": "7015216", "likeCount": "85251", "dislikeCount": "1306", "favoriteCount": "0", "commentCount": "4659"}}, {"kind": "youtube#video", "etag": "\"XpPGQXPnxQJhLgs6enD_n8JR4Qk/wChmw8q8Zf96WR_Ke38cwv-CeLU\"", "id": "km_JmxnzTvc", "snippet": {"publishedAt": "2017-03-15T09:14:50.000Z", "channelId": "UCubdcxYrG1gZIx_UAqvDNpg", "title": "Jaimie Johnson: Born Rich,  Children Of the Insanely Wealthy", "description": "The  first of two films by Jamie Johnson, heir to the Johnson & Johnson pharmaceutical fortune, captures the rituals, worries and social customs of the current generation of Trumps, Vanderbilts, Newhouses and Bloombergs. \n\nAmong the peers Johnson interviews are: Josiah Hornblower, heir to the Vanderbilt and Whitney fortunes; S.I.

Go to reason.com for a point of view you won't get from legacy media and old left-right opinion magazines.\n\n----------------\n\nEach night, tens of thousands of people sleep in tent cities crowding the palm-lined boulevards of Los Angeles, far more than any other city in the nation. The homeless population in the entertainment capital of the world has hit new record highs in each of the past few years.\n\nBut a 39-year-old struggling musician from South LA thought he had a creative fix. Elvis Summers, who went through stretches of homelessness himself in his 20s, raised over $100,000 through crowdfunding campaigns last spring. With the help of professional contractors and others in the community who sign up to volunteer through his nonprofit, Starting Human, he has built dozens of solar-powered, tiny houses to shelter the homeless since.\n\nSummers says that the houses are meant to be a temporary solution that, unlike a tent, provides the secure foundation residents need to improve their lives. \"The tiny houses provide immediate shelter,\" he explains. \"People can lock their stuff up and know that when they come back from their drug treatment program or court or finding a job all day, their stuff is where they left it.\"\n\nEach house features a solar power system, a steel-reinforced door, a camping toilet, a smoke detector, and even window alarms. The tiny structures cost Summers roughly $1,200 apiece to build.\n\nLA city officials, however, had a different plan to address the crisis. A decade after the city's first 10-year plan to end homelessness withered in 2006, Mayor Eric Garcetti announced in February a $1.87 billion proposal to get all LA residents off the streets, once and for all. He and the City Council aim to build 10,000 units of permanent housing with supportive services over the next decade. In the interim, they are shifting funds away from temporary and emergency shelters.\n\nCouncilmember Curren Price, who represents the district where Summers's tiny houses were located, does not believe they are beneficial either to the community or to the homeless people housed in them. \"I don't really want to call them houses. They're really just boxes,\" says Price. \"They're not safe, and they impose real hazards for neighbors in the community.\"\n\nMost of Summers's tiny houses are on private land that has been donated to the project. A handful had replaced the tents that have proliferated on freeway overpasses in the city. Summers put them there until he could secure a private lot to create a tiny house village similar to those that already exist in Portland, Seattle, Austin, and elsewhere. \"My whole issue and cause is that something needs to be done right now,\" Summers emphasizes.\n\nBut the houses, nestled among dour tent shantytowns, became brightly colored targets early this year for frustrated residents who want the homeless out of their backyards.

The homeless population in the entertainment capital of the world has hit new record highs in each of the past few years.\n\nBut a 39-year-old struggling musician from South LA thought he had a creative fix. Elvis Summers, who went through stretches of homelessness himself in his 20s, raised over $100,000 through crowdfunding campaigns last spring. With the help of professional contractors and others in the community who sign up to volunteer through his nonprofit, Starting Human, he has built dozens of solar-powered, tiny houses to shelter the homeless since.\n\nSummers says that the houses are meant to be a temporary solution that, unlike a tent, provides the secure foundation residents need to improve their lives. \"The tiny houses provide immediate shelter,\" he explains. \"People can lock their stuff up and know that when they come back from their drug treatment program or court or finding a job all day, their stuff is where they left it.\"\n\nEach house features a solar power system, a steel-reinforced door, a camping toilet, a smoke detector, and even window alarms.

used as a location for the Peter Pan blockbuster."}}, "contentDetails": {"duration": "PT46M9S", "dimension": "2d", "definition": "hd", "caption": "false", "licensedContent": false, "projection": "rectangular"}, "statistics": {"viewCount": "1186699", "likeCount": "6867", "dislikeCount": "489", "favoriteCount": "0", "commentCount": "1104"}}, {"kind": "youtube#video", "etag": "\"XpPGQXPnxQJhLgs6enD_n8JR4Qk/q-S3zW12AQgxizBk9uAKctKWp4E\"", "id": "3H6hnFV-nDU", "snippet": {"publishedAt": "2016-11-25T05:11:35.000Z", "channelId": "UCs75oyOfH-5RTM6LXTlh6NQ", "title": "Evolution of Video Game Graphics 1962-2017 (4K 60FPS)", "description": "Real life is starting to look pixelated. \n\nVideo Games: \n1962: Soacewar\n1972: Pong\n1973: Space Race\n1974: Tv Basketball\n1975: Gun Fight\n1976: Death Race\n1977: Canyon Bomber\n1978: Space Invaders\n1979: Speed Freak\n1980: Pacman\n1981: Donkey Kong\n1982: Pole Position\n1983: Tapper\n1984: Duck Hunt\n1985: Super Mario Bros. \n1986: The Legend of Zelda\n1987: Street Fighter\n1988: Galaxy Force 2\n1989: Prince of Persia\n1990: Mickey Mouse Castle of Illusion\n1991: Sonic The Hedgehog\n1992: Mortal Combat\n1993: Doom \n1994: Tekken\n1995: Time Crisis\n1996: Quake\n1997: Gran Turismo\n1997: Grand Theft Auto\n1998: Half Life\n1999: Unreal Tournament\n2000: Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 2\n2001: Max Payne\n2002: Hitman 2: Silent Assassin\n2003: Tom Clancy's Splinter Cell\n2004: Half-Life 2\n2005: Grand Theft Auto San Andreas\n2006: The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion\n2007: Halo 3\n2008: Left 4 Dead\n2009: Batman: Arkham Asylum\n2010: Bioshock 2\n2011: Skyrim\n2012: Far Cry 3\n2013: Tomb Raider\n2014: Grand Theft Auto V (Next Gen Release)\n2015: Star Wars Battlefront\n2016: Battlefield 1\n2017: Horizon Zero Dawn", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/3H6hnFV-nDU/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/3H6hnFV-nDU/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/3H6hnFV-nDU/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}, "standard": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/3H6hnFV-nDU/sddefault.jpg", "width": 640, "height": 480}, "maxres": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/3H6hnFV-nDU/maxresdefault.jpg", "width": 1280, "height": 720}}, "channelTitle": "Data Radar", "tags": ["data radar", "dataradar", "evolution of video game graphics", "evolution", "progress", "decades", "video game", "graphics", "pc", "windows", "playstation", "nintendo", "xbox", "horizon zero dawn", "battlefield", "4k", "60fps", "gta", "radar", "history", "future", "futuristic", "resolution", "gameplay", "gaming", "xbox one", "2017", "best", "ps4", "games", "console", "tech", "review", "playstation 4", "multiplayer", "quake", "doom", "virtual reality", "sony", "playstation 4 pro", "top 10", "nintendo switch", "xbox one x", "unboxing", "wolfenstein", "2018"], "categoryId": "20", "liveBroadcastContent": "none", "localized": {"title": "Evolution of Video Game Graphics 1962-2017 (4K 60FPS)", "description": "Real life is starting to look pixelated. \n\nVideo Games: \n1962: Soacewar\n1972: Pong\n1973: Space Race\n1974: Tv Basketball\n1975: Gun Fight\n1976: Death Race\n1977: Canyon Bomber\n1978: Space Invaders\n1979: Speed Freak\n1980: Pacman\n1981: Donkey Kong\n1982: Pole Position\n1983: Tapper\n1984: Duck Hunt\n1985: Super Mario Bros. \n1986: The Legend of Zelda\n1987: Street Fighter\n1988: Galaxy Force 2\n1989: Prince of Persia\n1990: Mickey Mouse Castle of Illusion\n1991: Sonic The Hedgehog\n1992: Mortal Combat\n1993: Doom \n1994: Tekken\n1995: Time Crisis\n1996: Quake\n1997: Gran Turismo\n1997: Grand Theft Auto\n1998: Half Life\n1999: Unreal Tournament\n2000: Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 2\n2001: Max Payne\n2002: Hitman 2: Silent Assassin\n2003: Tom Clancy's Splinter Cell\n2004: Half-Life 2\n2005: Grand Theft Auto San Andreas\n2006: The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion\n2007: Halo 3\n2008: Left 4 Dead\n2009: Batman: Arkham Asylum\n2010: Bioshock 2\n2011: Skyrim\n2012: Far Cry 3\n2013: Tomb Raider\n2014: Grand Theft Auto V (Next Gen Release)\n2015: Star Wars Battlefront\n2016: Battlefield 1\n2017: Horizon Zero Dawn"}, "defaultAudioLanguage": "en"}, "contentDetails": {"duration": "PT11M1S", "dimension": "2d", "definition": "hd", "caption": "false", "licensedContent": true, "projection": "rectangular"}, "statistics": {"viewCount": "11221155", "likeCount": "141167", "dislikeCount": "9298", "favoriteCount": "0", "commentCount": "20904"}}, {"kind": "youtube#video", "etag": "\"XpPGQXPnxQJhLgs6enD_n8JR4Qk/UHalUTXPge-0UaHoPi5Vt2Uaaug\"", "id": "yYQ-C1UPfgo", "snippet": {"publishedAt": "2017-10-13T16:00:07.000Z", "channelId": "UC_E4px0RST-qFwXLJWBav8Q", "title": "How Blizzard Conquered the Gaming World", "description": "The first 500 people to use this link will get a 2-month free trial of Skillshare.

After founding the Empire and being proclaimed \"Genghis Khan\", he started the Mongol invasions that conquered most of Eurasia. Campaigns initiated in his lifetime include those against the Qara Khitai, Caucasus, and Khwarazmian, Western Xia and Jin dynasties. These campaigns were often accompanied by wholesale massacres of the civilian populations \u2013 especially in the Khwarazmian and Western Xia controlled lands. By the end of his life, the Mongol Empire occupied a substantial portion of Central Asia and China.\nBefore Genghis Khan died, he assigned \u00d6gedei Khan as his successor and split his empire into khanates among his sons and grandsons. He died in 1227 after defeating the Western Xia. He was buried in an unmarked grave somewhere in Mongolia. His descendants extended the Mongol Empire across most of Eurasia by conquering or creating vassal states in all of modern-day China, Korea, the Caucasus, Central Asia, and substantial portions of modern Eastern Europe, Russia, and Southwest Asia. Many of these invasions repeated the earlier large-scale slaughters of local populations. As a result, Genghis Khan and his empire have a fearsome reputation in local histories.\nBeyond his military accomplishments, Genghis Khan also advanced the Mongol Empire in other ways. He decreed the adoption of the Uyghur script as the Mongol Empire's writing system. He also practiced meritocracy and encouraged religious tolerance in the Mongol Empire while unifying the nomadic tribes of Northeast Asia. Present-day Mongolians regard him as the founding father of Mongolia.\nAlthough known for the brutality of his campaigns and considered by many to have been a genocidal ruler, Genghis Khan is also credited with bringing the Silk Road under one cohesive political environment. This brought communication and trade from Northeast Asia into Muslim Southwest Asia and Christian Europe, thus expanding the horizons of all three cultural areas.\nMain article: Mongol military tactics and organization\nReenactment of Mongol battle\nGenghis Khan put absolute trust in his generals, such as Muqali, Jebe and Subutai, and regarded them as close advisors, often extending them the same privileges and trust normally reserved for close family members. He allowed them to make decisions on their own when they embarked on campaigns far from the Mongol Empire capital Karakorum. Muqali, a trusted lieutenant, was given command of the Mongol forces against the Jin dynasty while Genghis Khan was fighting in Central Asia, and Subutai and Jebe were allowed to pursue the Great Raid into the Caucasus and Kievan Rus', an idea they had presented to the Khagan on their own initiative. While granting his generals a great deal of autonomy in making command decisions, Genghis Khan also expected unwavering loyalty from them.\nThe Mongol military was also successful in siege warfare, cutting off resources for cities and towns by diverting certain rivers, taking enemy prisoners and driving them in front of the army, and adopting new ideas, techniques and tools from the people they conquered, particularly in employing Muslim and Chinese siege engines and engineers to aid the Mongol cavalry in capturing cities. Another standard tactic of the Mongol military was the commonly practiced feigned retreat to break enemy formations and to lure small enemy groups away from the larger group and defended position for ambush and counterattack.\nAnother important aspect of the military organization of Genghis Khan was the communications and supply route or Yam, adapted from previous Chinese models. Genghis Khan dedicated special attention to this in order to speed up the gathering of military intelligence and official communications. To this end, Yam waystations were established all over the empire.\nIn addition to most of the Mongol nobility up to the 20th century, the Mughal emperor Babur's mother was a descendant.

Its cult following has only grown in recent years and permeated American culture. Several parts of the film have turned into memes. The film changed the meaning of \u201cTPS report.\u201d Now, people think of pointless, tedious paperwork when they think of TPS reports. The PC LOAD LETTER error message also got a new meaning thanks to this movie- people now associate it with any confusing, vague message from a computer.\n\nThe famous printer destroying scene has been parodied numerous times since, including in this 2016 election campaign ad by Ted Cruz, which attacked Hillary Clinton after her email controversy. \n\nAnother great example of the film\u2019s impact is seen through that red Swingline stapler that Milton so coveted. Ever since its release, the actor who played Milton, Stephen Root, has said he consistently gets people asking him to sign their red Swingline staplers, and actually, those red Swingline staplers didn\u2019t even exist until more than three years after the film\u2019s release. The Swingline staple in the film was spray painted red. So this is reality imitating art, because if it weren\u2019t for the movie, Swingline would never had made those red staplers later on.\n\nOffice Space helped the modern workplace become a genre in art. Although the comic strip Dilbert had already been around, it became more popular after Office Space. In 2001, the BBC launched The Office and it was hit. The American version was an even bigger hit a few years later. Because of how dreadful the workplace environment was portrayed in the film, there has been a noticeable trend for companies to break away from many of the features seen in it. Of course, Mike Judge later made fun of those trends later with his show Silicon Valley.\n\nJohn Altschuler, a frequent collaborator with Mike Judge over the years, said \u201c(Office Space) spoke to a generation in a way that few movies have. Nobody does this kind of material. It\u2019s all about the weirdness of real people in real life.\u201d 20 years later, Office Space still resonates as a film that accurately critiques and pokes fun at the corporate work environment and gets us thinking about having a fulfilling career and balancing work and the rest of our lives. I don\u2019t care what kind of work you do or don\u2019t do- it\u2019s simply not possible to not relate to this film, and that\u2019s why it will likely still resonate 20 years from now.\n\n\nFebruary 19th will be the 20th anniversary of this film coming out.

And what does this mean for the millions of ordinary people who suffer when the monetary, and financial system, breaks down? \n\nA film by Michael Oswald, Produced by Mike Horwath, featuring Ben Dyson of Positive Money, Josh Ryan-Collins of The New Economics Foundation, Ann Pettifor, the \"HBOS Whistleblower\" Paul Moore, Simon Dixon of Bank to the Future and Nick Dearden from the Jubliee Debt Campaign.\n\nHelp us translate this video: http://www.youtube.com/timedtext_video?ref=share&v=XcGh1Dex4Yo\nor contact us on info@queuepolitely.com\n\nBrought to you by: http://hushhushvideo.com/ and http://queuepolitely.com/"}, "defaultAudioLanguage": "de"}, "contentDetails": {"duration": "PT2H10M23S", "dimension": "2d", "definition": "hd", "caption": "true", "licensedContent": false, "projection": "rectangular"}, "statistics": {"viewCount": "2404671", "likeCount": "16817", "dislikeCount": "972", "favoriteCount": "0", "commentCount": "3992"}}, {"kind": "youtube#video", "etag": "\"XpPGQXPnxQJhLgs6enD_n8JR4Qk/oUGPz1_lOi1kQiMXwNZB139FtHI\"", "id": "eHlDo3Zj_58", "snippet": {"publishedAt": "2014-02-12T15:58:19.000Z", "channelId": "UCn8zNIfYAQNdrFRrr8oibKw", "title": "Life as a Truck-Stop Stripper", "description": "Everyone knows what charming places strip clubs can be, but perhaps there is no club so charming as one in Moriarty, New Mexico\u2014a truck stop with taxidermy and the bras of former employees on the walls, a few poles, a shitload of black light, and plenty of titties.

It was the most contaminated, and therefore the most dangerous, place in the zone. The remains of the roof coating of the 4th reactor. The operation on decontaminating the roof lasted more than five months. We will tell about only two days. About the most important two days in the life of an explorer - dosimetrist Valeriy Starodumov. He participated in this operation until it was over. He himself came out to the roof and led people there. He himself planted the \"victory banner\" at the level of 75 meters, as the signal for the zone: the roof coating has been decontaminated! Now, 25 years later, Valeriy Starodumov comes back to the zone. Now Chernobyl is a tourist object. But not for him...\n\nDAY ONE\nOn September 1, 1986 a German robot \"Joker\" broke down. With a lot of difficulties this robot was installed in the most dangerous zone \"M\". Local robots were unable to work there. High hopes were placed on \"Joker\". It was the last argument that people should not be used for decontamination. But the robot \"sat down\" on the graphite block and was stuck there. Our hero with two other subordinates came out to the roof coating into the zone of high radioactivity to pull off \"the Fritz\" with the help of winch. They managed to do this but...\n\nFragment of the monologue: \"It turned out that it was not just jammed track. Some idiot, trying to prove to the world that there can be no global catastrophes at the Soviet nuclear power stations, underrated by a factor of ten the radiation levels in the application. Pedantic Germans have programmed the robot in accordance with the order and \"Joker\" suddenly died. The electronic brains of \"the Fritz' burned out. So my \"heroic\" escapade was a bust. And also we got the soldiers to the winch for nothing. We just had to keep silent while their commander took it out on us.\"\n\nDAY TWO\nSeptember 19, 1986. The Governmental commission \"throws\" soldiers and military students into decontamination of the roof coating. Valeriy Starodumov trains and takes the first \"couple\" of soldiers to the zone of the highest contamination of more than 8000 Roentgen. After the successful experiment, the process \"is launched as conveyor\".\n\nFragment of the monologue: \"I will take a few hundred people through the zone. I will not know who they are, I will not see their faces behind protective masks and I will never know what is going to happen to them afterwards. It was not me who had made a decision to send these men to the zones of mortal danger, but each night some inexplicable feeling of guilt brings me back to the past. To that first two-minute shift, which has been continues for me for a quarter of century...\"\n\n\"...So, in the fall of 1986 3,828 people would pass through the roof coating of the Chernobyl power station. The heroes who saved the world \u0432\u0402\" the newspapers would write in a pathetic manner. A few years later the heroes would no longer be remembered, and then they would be completely forgotten. That's really true: \"life costs a penny\". However, it is much more important for a person what he himself appreciates in this life, rather than for how much someone evaluated it...\"", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/FfDa8tR25dk/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/FfDa8tR25dk/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/FfDa8tR25dk/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}}, "channelTitle": "TeleconStudio", "tags": ["Chernobyl", "3828", "Starodumov", "Tarakanov", "Samoylenko", "Golubev", "German", "robot", "Joker", "Biorobots", "Chernobyl Disaster (Disaster)", "1986.04.26", "explosion", "trip to Chernobyl", "Military people", "Heroes of Chernobyl", "Sarcophagus"], "categoryId": "28", "liveBroadcastContent": "none", "localized": {"title": "Chernobyl 3828", "description": "The documentary series \"Chernobyl P.S.\" \nhttps://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL8BTpGAaXEViUgAX3ZqqZMuE1zN8YcOR9\n\nMilitary people call such places \"FRONTLINE\", liquidators who worked at the Chornobyl nuclear station called it \"ROOF COATING\".

Now, 25 years later, Valeriy Starodumov comes back to the zone. Now Chernobyl is a tourist object. But not for him...\n\nDAY ONE\nOn September 1, 1986 a German robot \"Joker\" broke down. With a lot of difficulties this robot was installed in the most dangerous zone \"M\". Local robots were unable to work there. High hopes were placed on \"Joker\". It was the last argument that people should not be used for decontamination. But the robot \"sat down\" on the graphite block and was stuck there. Our hero with two other subordinates came out to the roof coating into the zone of high radioactivity to pull off \"the Fritz\" with the help of winch. They managed to do this but...\n\nFragment of the monologue: \"It turned out that it was not just jammed track. Some idiot, trying to prove to the world that there can be no global catastrophes at the Soviet nuclear power stations, underrated by a factor of ten the radiation levels in the application. Pedantic Germans have programmed the robot in accordance with the order and \"Joker\" suddenly died. The electronic brains of \"the Fritz' burned out. So my \"heroic\" escapade was a bust. And also we got the soldiers to the winch for nothing. We just had to keep silent while their commander took it out on us.\"\n\nDAY TWO\nSeptember 19, 1986. The Governmental commission \"throws\" soldiers and military students into decontamination of the roof coating. Valeriy Starodumov trains and takes the first \"couple\" of soldiers to the zone of the highest contamination of more than 8000 Roentgen. After the successful experiment, the process \"is launched as conveyor\".\n\nFragment of the monologue: \"I will take a few hundred people through the zone. I will not know who they are, I will not see their faces behind protective masks and I will never know what is going to happen to them afterwards. It was not me who had made a decision to send these men to the zones of mortal danger, but each night some inexplicable feeling of guilt brings me back to the past. To that first two-minute shift, which has been continues for me for a quarter of century...\"\n\n\"...So, in the fall of 1986 3,828 people would pass through the roof coating of the Chernobyl power station. The heroes who saved the world \u0432\u0402\" the newspapers would write in a pathetic manner. A few years later the heroes would no longer be remembered, and then they would be completely forgotten. That's really true: \"life costs a penny\". However, it is much more important for a person what he himself appreciates in this life, rather than for how much someone evaluated it...\""}, "defaultAudioLanguage": "en-US"}, "contentDetails": {"duration": "PT26M57S", "dimension": "2d", "definition": "sd", "caption": "true", "licensedContent": false, "projection": "rectangular"}, "statistics": {"viewCount": "1028889", "likeCount": "9844", "dislikeCount": "320", "favoriteCount": "0", "commentCount": "1747"}}, {"kind": "youtube#video", "etag": "\"XpPGQXPnxQJhLgs6enD_n8JR4Qk/Cfsv74u2SJfhDt6AtVkbPq2YHk4\"", "id": "rNm_Pf_eR1w", "snippet": {"publishedAt": "2016-10-23T00:30:00.000Z", "channelId": "UCCdGsFSmTOBaBxU3xuYYNXA", "title": "National Geographic - Crows National Geographic Documentary HD", "description": "Thanks for Watching.

When he got out at 69, he rejoined a world that was starkly different from the one he remembered. This is his story.\nLast year, we met Otis Johnson at a New York City shelter for ex-convicts. Everyone there was trying to get their feet back on the ground. Otis had just got out of prison after serving a 44-year sentence. The last time he had seen his family was May 1975.\n\nWhen we shared Otis's first story of being reintroduced to the modern world, viewers were amazed by just how unfamiliar everything was to him. iPhones, Times Square, jars of pre-mixed peanut butter and jelly ... everything was new or starkly different.\n\nINTERACTIVE: My life after 44 years in prison. The story of Otis Johnson\nHis story clearly resonated with people. More than 12 million people watched Otis' story on YouTube, and we wanted to show them what happened next.\n\nWe went to Asbury Park, in New Jersey, with Otis to try to find them. Reconnecting with family was something he had said he was always interested in doing, but hadn't got round to yet. After all, he was still learning how to navigate the city. He had a small box where he kept old, tattered photos of family members, but that was basically all the information he had on them.\n\n\"The only address I really have is Asbury Park,\" Otis told us. So we took the train to Asbury Park not knowing much.\n\nBut we did have Otis' memory. Once we arrived at the train station and began roaming the streets, small things about his old home slowly came back to him: extended family members, friends, shops. He wanted to find his aunt, Dottie Moore, and some other family members. He said many would probably think he was dead.\n\nWhen we talked to Otis about his relationship with his family, his answers were complicated. He was a member of the Fruit of Islam (the paramilitary wing of Nation of Islam, the Islamic religious movement once famously led by Malcom X) in his younger days. The Nation of Islam's stated goals were to improve the spiritual, mental, social, and economic condition of African Americans. Otis was a devout Muslim who said he helped \"clean up the streets\" of drug dealers.\n\n\"We wasn't all bad,\" he would say.\n\nBut Otis said some of his family members didn't buy that. He didn't know if they would be angry or happy to see him after all these years away. He had a nervous energy about him as we walked down Pine Street, knocking on doors and asking strangers about Dottie Moore.\n\nThis final story on Otis Johnson is one of reconnection and reconciliation. It is the story of a man on a quest to reunite with remnants of his past and one, we hope, many can relate to.\nFind out more about Otis:\nhttp://aje.io/LifeAfterPrison\n\nMore AJ Shorts:\nhttp://aljazeera.com/shorts\n\n--\nFilmmakers: \nElena Boffetta - https://twitter.com/ElenaBoffetta\nJenna Belhumeur - https://twitter.com/jenna_bel\n\nExecutive Producer: \nYasir Khan - https://twitter.com/khanundrum\n\nSubscribe to our channel  http://bit.ly/AJSubscribe\nFollow us on Twitter https://twitter.com/AJEnglish\nFind us on Facebook https://www.facebook.com/aljazeera\nCheck our website:  http://www.aljazeera.com/\n#AlJazeeraEnglish\n#AlJazeeraBreaking\n#AlJazeeraLatestNews", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/OrH6UMYAVsk/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/OrH6UMYAVsk/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/OrH6UMYAVsk/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}, "standard": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/OrH6UMYAVsk/sddefault.jpg", "width": 640, "height": 480}, "maxres": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/OrH6UMYAVsk/maxresdefault.jpg", "width": 1280, "height": 720}}, "channelTitle": "Al Jazeera English", "tags": ["40 years in prison", "44 years in prison", "life after 44 years in prison", "my life after 44", "aljazeera english", "al jazeera english", "aljazeera", "america prisons", "otis johnson", "life after prison", "my life after 44 years", "man released from prison after 40 years", "life in prison", "after 44 years in prison", "life in jail", "leaving prison", "AJ Shorts", "prisons", "us jails", "asbury park", "otis johson", "whats it like", "real stories", "human being", "after jail", "after prison show", "the after prison show"], "categoryId": "25", "liveBroadcastContent": "none", "defaultLanguage": "en", "localized": {"title": "\ud83c\uddfa\ud83c\uddf8 My Life After 44 Years In Prison | AJ Shorts", "description": "Want to stay on top of all the news you actually care about?   http://bit.ly/AJSubscribe\n\nOtis Johnson went to jail at the age of 25.

Her family embarked on a cultural odyssey that would greatly influence her life: the Stuarts dug up their middle-class roots in Vancouver\u2019s Jewish community and replanted them in a rural Japanese town called Saku for a year.\n\nIt was during this absorbing year that Jessica met Fukue, a bright and bubbly girl with rosy red cheeks and an endless smile. Fukue and Jessica became like sisters, spending their days frolicking in the autumn leaves, dancing under snow-blanketed trees, watching hot air balloons illuminate the skyline in spring and sneaking through rice paddies in early summer.\n\nStrangely, Fukue never invited Jessica to visit her family home. One day after school, Jessica insisted. Fukue reluctantly brought Jessica to her house; it was a derelict shack on the outskirts of town. Shocked and disturbed, Jessica started to make sense of the name-calling and bullying that Fukue suffered at school.\n\nAs the Stuarts\u2019 year in Japan came to an end, Jessica and Fukue assured one another they would keep in touch. They became pen pals, writing letters back and forth for two years, until the letters from Fukue stopped \u2014 with no explanation.\n\nNow a musician in her 30s, Jessica has never forgotten Fukue.

Her family embarked on a cultural odyssey that would greatly influence her life: the Stuarts dug up their middle-class roots in Vancouver\u2019s Jewish community and replanted them in a rural Japanese town called Saku for a year.\n\nIt was during this absorbing year that Jessica met Fukue, a bright and bubbly girl with rosy red cheeks and an endless smile. Fukue and Jessica became like sisters, spending their days frolicking in the autumn leaves, dancing under snow-blanketed trees, watching hot air balloons illuminate the skyline in spring and sneaking through rice paddies in early summer.\n\nStrangely, Fukue never invited Jessica to visit her family home. One day after school, Jessica insisted. Fukue reluctantly brought Jessica to her house; it was a derelict shack on the outskirts of town. Shocked and disturbed, Jessica started to make sense of the name-calling and bullying that Fukue suffered at school.\n\nAs the Stuarts\u2019 year in Japan came to an end, Jessica and Fukue assured one another they would keep in touch. They became pen pals, writing letters back and forth for two years, until the letters from Fukue stopped \u2014 with no explanation.\n\nNow a musician in her 30s, Jessica has never forgotten Fukue. Her memories of their time together are beautiful, but haunting. And so her thoughts turn to the unknown. Where is Fukue now? Does she remember Jessica? Why did her letters stop all those years ago?\n\nNow, nearly 30 years after she left Japan, Jessica is going back to find the answers to these questions.

Bush held a narrow lead over Al Gore. Out of nearly 6 million ballots in Florida, only 1784 votes separated the two. Under Florida law, and since the United States has a winner takes all system, the candidate with the most votes in the state got all of its electoral votes. Because it was so freaking close, state law said there had to be a machine vote recount. After the recount, it was even closer! Now, Bush\u2019s lead was just 327.\n\nNo worries. Florida law also allowed Gore the option of a manual vote recount, meaning counting them by hand, in whatever counties Gore wanted. He was like, \u201cUh, yeah,\u201d and picked four counties: Broward, Miami-Dade, Volusia, and Palm Beach. The problem, though, was that Gore was running out of time. Florida law also said (man Florida law says a lot) the state\u2019s election results have to be certified within seven days of the election. Since election day was November 7, that meant the deadline was November 14th. Well three of those four counties didn\u2019t get er done before the deadline. Despite those counties trying to get an extension, the Florida Secretary of State, Katherine Harris, went ahead and announced she would be certifying the votes, ending all the recounts. \n\nAl Gore was like nuh-uh. He and Palm Beach County tried to get an injunction against Secretary Harris to prevent her from certifying the votes until those three counties got their recounts done. The Florida Supreme Court said \u201csure,\u201d and granted the injunction on November 17. On November 21, it ruled that Secretary Harris had to let those counties finish recounting with a new deadline of November 26th. But Miami-Dade county was like, \u201cnah man, that\u2019s not enough time,\u201d and it gave up counting! Gore said \u201chey hey hey Miami-Dade, you must count,\u201d and tried to get another court order to force them but that one failed. On November 26, Harris certified the election, giving Bush what was now just a 537-vote victory.\n\nYou know what? Gore sued Harris, arguing the certified results were invalid because the recount process wasn\u2019t finished yet. The Leon County Circuit dismissed his lawsuit, so Gore appealed to the Florida Supreme Court, which, on December 8, ruled in favor of Gore. They demanded that all votes not counted by voting machines had to be manually recounted if they hadn\u2019t been already. \n\nWell George W. Bush stepped in and said \u201chey hey hey hey...now wait just a minute\u201d and appealed this decision to the United States Supreme Court. And holy crap, THE VERY NEXT DAY the Supreme Court reviewed the case. Why did the Supreme Court respond quicker than it ever does? Well, this was obviously important. Soon, the deadline for electors to formally submit their choice would be there, and soon after the new President would have to be inaugurated. Things needed to move along. The Court heard oral arguments on December 11th. \n\nThrough all of this, protesters lined the streets outside. Rarely throughout American history did the country seem so divided. Things were tense, to say the least. So what was the Court really looking at in this case? Well, the issue now was whether or not the Florida Supreme Court violated Article II Section 1 Clause 2 of the Constitution, specifically the part that says: \n\n\u201cEach State shall appoint, in such Manner as the Legislature thereof may direct, a Number of Electors\u2026\u201d\n\nSo could the Florida Supreme Court really step in on this? Also, Bush argued that the recounts went against the Equal Protection Clause of the 14th Amendment.\n\n#supremecourtbriefs #scotus #apush", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/tg6rygk9VDc/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/tg6rygk9VDc/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/tg6rygk9VDc/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}, "standard": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/tg6rygk9VDc/sddefault.jpg", "width": 640, "height": 480}, "maxres": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/tg6rygk9VDc/maxresdefault.jpg", "width": 1280, "height": 720}}, "channelTitle": "Mr. Beat", "tags": ["Bush v.

Because it was so freaking close, state law said there had to be a machine vote recount. After the recount, it was even closer! Now, Bush\u2019s lead was just 327.\n\nNo worries. Florida law also allowed Gore the option of a manual vote recount, meaning counting them by hand, in whatever counties Gore wanted. He was like, \u201cUh, yeah,\u201d and picked four counties: Broward, Miami-Dade, Volusia, and Palm Beach. The problem, though, was that Gore was running out of time. Florida law also said (man Florida law says a lot) the state\u2019s election results have to be certified within seven days of the election. Since election day was November 7, that meant the deadline was November 14th. Well three of those four counties didn\u2019t get er done before the deadline. Despite those counties trying to get an extension, the Florida Secretary of State, Katherine Harris, went ahead and announced she would be certifying the votes, ending all the recounts. \n\nAl Gore was like nuh-uh. He and Palm Beach County tried to get an injunction against Secretary Harris to prevent her from certifying the votes until those three counties got their recounts done. The Florida Supreme Court said \u201csure,\u201d and granted the injunction on November 17. On November 21, it ruled that Secretary Harris had to let those counties finish recounting with a new deadline of November 26th. But Miami-Dade county was like, \u201cnah man, that\u2019s not enough time,\u201d and it gave up counting! Gore said \u201chey hey hey Miami-Dade, you must count,\u201d and tried to get another court order to force them but that one failed. On November 26, Harris certified the election, giving Bush what was now just a 537-vote victory.\n\nYou know what? Gore sued Harris, arguing the certified results were invalid because the recount process wasn\u2019t finished yet. The Leon County Circuit dismissed his lawsuit, so Gore appealed to the Florida Supreme Court, which, on December 8, ruled in favor of Gore. They demanded that all votes not counted by voting machines had to be manually recounted if they hadn\u2019t been already. \n\nWell George W. Bush stepped in and said \u201chey hey hey hey...now wait just a minute\u201d and appealed this decision to the United States Supreme Court. And holy crap, THE VERY NEXT DAY the Supreme Court reviewed the case. Why did the Supreme Court respond quicker than it ever does? Well, this was obviously important. Soon, the deadline for electors to formally submit their choice would be there, and soon after the new President would have to be inaugurated. Things needed to move along. The Court heard oral arguments on December 11th. \n\nThrough all of this, protesters lined the streets outside. Rarely throughout American history did the country seem so divided. Things were tense, to say the least. So what was the Court really looking at in this case? Well, the issue now was whether or not the Florida Supreme Court violated Article II Section 1 Clause 2 of the Constitution, specifically the part that says: \n\n\u201cEach State shall appoint, in such Manner as the Legislature thereof may direct, a Number of Electors\u2026\u201d\n\nSo could the Florida Supreme Court really step in on this? Also, Bush argued that the recounts went against the Equal Protection Clause of the 14th Amendment.\n\n#supremecourtbriefs #scotus #apush"}, "defaultAudioLanguage": "en"}, "contentDetails": {"duration": "PT6M10S", "dimension": "2d", "definition": "hd", "caption": "true", "licensedContent": true, "projection": "rectangular"}, "statistics": {"viewCount": "36146", "likeCount": "873", "dislikeCount": "32", "favoriteCount": "0", "commentCount": "388"}}, {"kind": "youtube#video", "etag": "\"XpPGQXPnxQJhLgs6enD_n8JR4Qk/FIXV1P4-dPPcYHWaHY3jcEtDkdU\"", "id": "sI4VihERXNo", "snippet": {"publishedAt": "2015-04-22T20:31:20.000Z", "channelId": "UCrkMZ_C820dcHbKFnYQyJZQ", "title": "The Redemption of General Butt Naked full movie", "description": "One of the MOST AWESOME AND REAL ministry movies to exist on all levels...", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/sI4VihERXNo/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/sI4VihERXNo/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/sI4VihERXNo/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}, "standard": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/sI4VihERXNo/sddefault.jpg", "width": 640, "height": 480}}, "channelTitle": "GODZGANG100", "categoryId": "22", "liveBroadcastContent": "none", "localized": {"title": "The Redemption of General Butt Naked full movie", "description": "One of the MOST AWESOME AND REAL ministry movies to exist on all levels..."}}, "contentDetails": {"duration": "PT1H25M25S", "dimension": "2d", "definition": "sd", "caption": "false", "licensedContent": false, "regionRestriction": {"blocked": ["US"]}, "projection": "rectangular"}, "statistics": {"viewCount": "46203", "likeCount": "305", "dislikeCount": "27", "favoriteCount": "0", "commentCount": "216"}}, {"kind": "youtube#video", "etag": "\"XpPGQXPnxQJhLgs6enD_n8JR4Qk/elxU22wZ8EsmJtX35dOdWBZrZ1c\"", "id": "WCsb1_wBzuQ", "snippet": {"publishedAt": "2017-11-10T09:57:50.000Z", "channelId": "UCwfJZGGiPjioj7_0Dxy5u9g", "title": "Money as Debt I - Updated FULL HD [2006]", "description": "One of the easiest to understand videos on the fractional reserve banking scam.

Here is Oobah's journey into a false reality that captured the world's attention.\n\nRead Oobah's full story on VICE.com - https://vice.video/2DrLgCC\n\nClick here to subscribe to VICE: http://bit.ly/Subscribe-to-VICE\n\nCheck out our full video catalog: http://bit.ly/VICE-Videos\nVideos, daily editorial and more: http://vice.com\nMore videos from the VICE network: https://www.fb.com/vicevideo\nLike VICE on Facebook: http://fb.com/vice\nFollow VICE on Twitter: http://twitter.com/vice\nRead our Tumblr: http://vicemag.tumblr.com\nFollow us on Instagram: http://instagram.com/vice\nCheck out our Pinterest: https://pinterest.com/vicemag\nDownload VICE on iOS: http://apple.co/28Vgmqz\nDownload VICE on Android: http://bit.ly/28S8Et0"}, "defaultAudioLanguage": "en"}, "contentDetails": {"duration": "PT18M21S", "dimension": "2d", "definition": "hd", "caption": "true", "licensedContent": true, "projection": "rectangular"}, "statistics": {"viewCount": "4413936", "likeCount": "132936", "dislikeCount": "1713", "favoriteCount": "0", "commentCount": "4794"}}, {"kind": "youtube#video", "etag": "\"XpPGQXPnxQJhLgs6enD_n8JR4Qk/9H_xgkS_XF6EVVWCTAzZN_7yU4U\"", "id": "KwrqhOQrV6Q", "snippet": {"publishedAt": "2017-12-23T20:58:12.000Z", "channelId": "UCZLdctC9BBh0iMrUrQMd1Bg", "title": "The Perilous Fight: America's World War II in Color Part 1", "description": "Underrated PBS Documentary from 2004.

When he got out at 69, he rejoined a world that was starkly different from the one he remembered. This is his story.\nLast year, we met Otis Johnson at a New York City shelter for ex-convicts. Everyone there was trying to get their feet back on the ground. Otis had just got out of prison after serving a 44-year sentence. The last time he had seen his family was May 1975.\n\nWhen we shared Otis's first story of being reintroduced to the modern world, viewers were amazed by just how unfamiliar everything was to him. iPhones, Times Square, jars of pre-mixed peanut butter and jelly ... everything was new or starkly different.\n\nINTERACTIVE: My life after 44 years in prison. The story of Otis Johnson\nHis story clearly resonated with people. More than 12 million people watched Otis' story on YouTube, and we wanted to show them what happened next.\n\nWe went to Asbury Park, in New Jersey, with Otis to try to find them. Reconnecting with family was something he had said he was always interested in doing, but hadn't got round to yet. After all, he was still learning how to navigate the city. He had a small box where he kept old, tattered photos of family members, but that was basically all the information he had on them.\n\n\"The only address I really have is Asbury Park,\" Otis told us. So we took the train to Asbury Park not knowing much.\n\nBut we did have Otis' memory. Once we arrived at the train station and began roaming the streets, small things about his old home slowly came back to him: extended family members, friends, shops. He wanted to find his aunt, Dottie Moore, and some other family members. He said many would probably think he was dead.\n\nWhen we talked to Otis about his relationship with his family, his answers were complicated. He was a member of the Fruit of Islam (the paramilitary wing of Nation of Islam, the Islamic religious movement once famously led by Malcom X) in his younger days. The Nation of Islam's stated goals were to improve the spiritual, mental, social, and economic condition of African Americans. Otis was a devout Muslim who said he helped \"clean up the streets\" of drug dealers.\n\n\"We wasn't all bad,\" he would say.\n\nBut Otis said some of his family members didn't buy that. He didn't know if they would be angry or happy to see him after all these years away. He had a nervous energy about him as we walked down Pine Street, knocking on doors and asking strangers about Dottie Moore.\n\nThis final story on Otis Johnson is one of reconnection and reconciliation. It is the story of a man on a quest to reunite with remnants of his past and one, we hope, many can relate to.\nFind out more about Otis:\nhttp://aje.io/LifeAfterPrison\n\nMore AJ Shorts:\nhttp://aljazeera.com/shorts\n\n--\nFilmmakers: \nElena Boffetta - https://twitter.com/ElenaBoffetta\nJenna Belhumeur - https://twitter.com/jenna_bel\n\nExecutive Producer: \nYasir Khan - https://twitter.com/khanundrum\n\nSubscribe to our channel  http://bit.ly/AJSubscribe\nFollow us on Twitter https://twitter.com/AJEnglish\nFind us on Facebook https://www.facebook.com/aljazeera\nCheck our website:  http://www.aljazeera.com/\n#AlJazeeraEnglish\n#AlJazeeraBreaking\n#AlJazeeraLatestNews", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/OrH6UMYAVsk/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/OrH6UMYAVsk/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/OrH6UMYAVsk/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}, "standard": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/OrH6UMYAVsk/sddefault.jpg", "width": 640, "height": 480}, "maxres": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/OrH6UMYAVsk/maxresdefault.jpg", "width": 1280, "height": 720}}, "channelTitle": "Al Jazeera English", "tags": ["40 years in prison", "44 years in prison", "life after 44 years in prison", "my life after 44", "aljazeera english", "al jazeera english", "aljazeera", "america prisons", "otis johnson", "life after prison", "my life after 44 years", "man released from prison after 40 years", "life in prison", "after 44 years in prison", "life in jail", "leaving prison", "AJ Shorts", "prisons", "us jails", "asbury park", "otis johson", "whats it like", "real stories", "human being", "after jail", "after prison show", "the after prison show"], "categoryId": "25", "liveBroadcastContent": "none", "defaultLanguage": "en", "localized": {"title": "\ud83c\uddfa\ud83c\uddf8 My Life After 44 Years In Prison | AJ Shorts", "description": "Want to stay on top of all the news you actually care about?   http://bit.ly/AJSubscribe\n\nOtis Johnson went to jail at the age of 25.

When we type in \"hillary clinton cri\" in to Google, the sites auto complete function shows three potential searches: \"hillary clinton crime reform\", \"hillary clinton crisis\", and \"hillary clinton crime bill 1994\"...Full Transcript: http://pastebin.com/raw/XXdhjEtw\n\nShare this video:\nhttps://youtu.be/3_tWyvnH0xY\n\nAnonymous - Hillary Clinton: The Hillary Files Full Documentary:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b3oTYYTd1F4\n\nAnonymous - Hillary Clinton: A Career Criminal:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wK2K5v5bm0Q\n\nCredit to \"SourceFed\" for transcript, some clips, and bringing this information to light (0:00-4:48):\nhttp://twitter.com/sourcefed\nhttp://www.facebook.com/pages/SourceFed/322741577776002\nhttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UC_gE-kg7JvuwCNlbZ1-shlA\nhttp://instagram.com/sourcefedofficial\nhttp://sourcefed.com\n\nCredit to \"Jeanette Johnson-Jing\" for their original video \"Hillary Clinton's debate lies\" (4:49-12:36):\nhttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UCY94H6egWc29pIX5gW0Vdow\n\n- Watch some of our other videos -\n\nAnonymous - VOTE ANONYMOUS 2016:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FI4HagtgTPQ\n\nAnonymous - The Hacker Wars Full Documentary:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ku9edEKvGuY\n\nAnonymous Documentary - How Anonymous Hackers Changed the World Full Documentary:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAECyLvSCHg\n\nAnonymous - The Story of Aaron Swartz Full Documentary:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpvcc9C8SbM\n\nAnonymous - Plan to defeat the Illuminati and New World Order:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kobrwhxgkgQ\n\n..........\n\nThere is no copyright infringement intended for the video and/or material used in this video.

Giger (Alien); and sci-fi paperback illustrator Chris Foss. For the cast, he lined up icons ranging from Salvador Dali and Mick Jagger to Orson Welles, and even his own son, who was put through two years of gruelling martial arts training to prepare for his role. Unfortunately, the film was never made.\n\nDirector Frank Pavich tackles one of cinema's most enthralling \" what could have been \" stories, weaving interviews with the charismatic Jodorowsky, his collaborators, and supporters (including Drive director Nicolas Winding Refn), together with animation to bring Moebius' storyboards to life. Even though the project exists only in the imaginations of its creators, and as the hundreds of illustrations they left behind, Pavich's documentary chooses not to dwell on failure, but rather celebrates the ways in which the creative dreams of Dune planted seeds for many other iconic films that came after it, from Star Wars to Alien to countless more. This is an inspirational story about the power of the creative spirit, one that establishes Jodorowsky as a master of cinema and a true visionary of our time. \n\nhttp://tiff.net/filmsandschedules/festival/2013/jodorowskysdune", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/NBUjGFMhuDg/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/NBUjGFMhuDg/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/NBUjGFMhuDg/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}, "standard": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/NBUjGFMhuDg/sddefault.jpg", "width": 640, "height": 480}, "maxres": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/NBUjGFMhuDg/maxresdefault.jpg", "width": 1280, "height": 720}}, "channelTitle": "TIFF Originals", "tags": ["tiff", "2014", "Trailer", "New Release 2014", "TIFF Bell Lightbox", "2330009643"], "categoryId": "1", "liveBroadcastContent": "none", "localized": {"title": "JODOROWSKY'S DUNE Trailer | New Release 2014", "description": "This fascinating documentary explores the genesis of one of cinema's greatest epics that never was: cult filmmaker Alejandro Jodorowsky's (El Topo) adaptation of Frank Herbert's sci-fi classic Dune, whose cast would have included such icons as Salvador Dal\u00ed, Orson Welles and Mick Jagger.\nIn 1975, following the runaway success of his art-house freak-outs El Topo and Holy Mountain, Alejandro Jodorowsky secured the rights to Frank Herbert's Dune \u2014 and began work on what was gearing up to be a cinematic game-changer, a sci-fi epic unlike anything the world had ever seen.\n\nJodorowsky enlisted an elite group of artistic mercenaries, including French comic book artist Moebius, who illustrated the storyboards; screenwriter Dan O'Bannon (Dark Star, Alien); artist H.R.

To answer this question, we will not only cover the story behind the series\u2019 rise to prominence and ultimate downfall but also provide a comprehensive overview of all the Medal of Honor games that have and haven\u2019t seen the light of day.\n\nNarrated by Steve Petitt\nWritten by Kyle Mann\nDirected by Ailert Riemersma\n\n#gvmers #medalofhonor #moh\n\nAny questions or concerns?

Raised in a quiet, picturesque village Ben was a Boy Scout, loved cricket, played in the school orchestra and looked forward to the annual family holiday. But despite his privileged start in life Ben found himself on the road to ruin, injecting heroin up to four times a day.\n\nDuring his last months, Ben kept a video diary of his drug use and desperate attempts to come off heroin. Ravaged by the drug, Ben's body began to break down: he developed DVT and his veins were rendered so useless he had to inject into his groin. Despite his family's best efforts, Ben couldn't stop. He was haunted by, and hooked on, heroin.\n\nBen: Diary of A Heroin Addict charts his lies and manipulation as he mixes his next hit whilst telling his mother Anne he is clean and making a new start. It reveals Anne's anger and tears as Ben loses his fight against the drugs and shows how father Mike's unconditional love continues undiminished as they are forced to deal with their son's addiction.\n\nDirector Olly Lambert comments: \"It's incredibly rare to come across such raw and unflinching footage of a man so close to an abyss.

Raised in a quiet, picturesque village Ben was a Boy Scout, loved cricket, played in the school orchestra and looked forward to the annual family holiday. But despite his privileged start in life Ben found himself on the road to ruin, injecting heroin up to four times a day.\n\nDuring his last months, Ben kept a video diary of his drug use and desperate attempts to come off heroin. Ravaged by the drug, Ben's body began to break down: he developed DVT and his veins were rendered so useless he had to inject into his groin. Despite his family's best efforts, Ben couldn't stop. He was haunted by, and hooked on, heroin.\n\nBen: Diary of A Heroin Addict charts his lies and manipulation as he mixes his next hit whilst telling his mother Anne he is clean and making a new start. It reveals Anne's anger and tears as Ben loses his fight against the drugs and shows how father Mike's unconditional love continues undiminished as they are forced to deal with their son's addiction.\n\nDirector Olly Lambert comments: \"It's incredibly rare to come across such raw and unflinching footage of a man so close to an abyss. I was speechless when I first watched it.  I hope the film finishes what Ben had begun: to give people a visceral understanding of the nature of addiction.  It has been a privilege to try and unpick who Ben really was using the intimate legacy he's left behind.\"\n\n\"I hope to god you look at these videos and see what a mess I got myself into\".

It was therefore not surprising that until recently, the universe was thought to be essentially static, and unchanging in time. On the other hand, it must have been obvious, that society is evolving in culture and technology. This indicates that the present phase of human history can not have been going for more than a few thousand years. Otherwise, we would be more advanced than we are. It was therefore natural to believe that the human race, and maybe the whole universe, had a beginning in the fairly recent past. However, many people were unhappy with the idea that the universe had a beginning, because it seemed to imply the existence of a supernatural being who created the universe. They preferred to believe that the universe, and the human race, had existed forever. Their explanation for human progress was that there had been periodic floods, or other natural disasters, which repeatedly set back the human race to a primitive state. \n\nThis argument about whether or not the universe had a beginning, persisted into the 19th and 20th centuries. It was conducted mainly on the basis of theology and philosophy, with little consideration of observational evidence. This may have been reasonable, given the notoriously unreliable character of cosmological observations, until fairly recently. The cosmologist, Sir Arthur Eddington, once said, 'Don't worry if your theory doesn't agree with the observations, because they are probably wrong.' But if your theory disagrees with the Second Law of Thermodynamics, it is in bad trouble. In fact, the theory that the universe has existed forever is in serious difficulty with the Second Law of Thermodynamics. The Second Law, states that disorder always increases with time. Like the argument about human progress, it indicates that there must have been a beginning. Otherwise, the universe would be in a state of complete disorder by now, and everything would be at the same temperature. In an infinite and everlasting universe, every line of sight would end on the surface of a star. This would mean that the night sky would have been as bright as the surface of the Sun. The only way of avoiding this problem would be if, for some reason, the stars did not shine before a certain time. \n\nIn a universe that was essentially static, there would not have been any dynamical reason, why the stars should have suddenly turned on, at some time. Any such \"lighting up time\" would have to be imposed by an intervention from outside the universe. The situation was different, however, when it was realised that the universe is not static, but expanding. Galaxies are moving steadily apart from each other. This means that they were closer together in the past. One can plot the separation of two galaxies, as a function of time. If there were no acceleration due to gravity, the graph would be a straight line. It would go down to zero separation, about twenty billion years ago. One would expect gravity, to cause the galaxies to accelerate towards each other. This will mean that the graph of the separation of two galaxies will bend downwards, below the straight line. So the time of zero separation, would have been less than twenty billion years ago. \n\nAt this time, the Big Bang, all the matter in the universe, would have been on top of itself. The density would have been infinite. It would have been what is called, a singularity. At a singularity, all the laws of physics would have broken down. This means that the state of the universe, after the Big Bang, will not depend on anything that may have happened before, because the deterministic laws that govern the universe will break down in the Big Bang. The universe will evolve from the Big Bang, completely independently of what it was like before. Even the amount of matter in the universe, can be different to what it was before the Big Bang, as the Law of Conservation of Matter, will break down at the Big Bang. \n\nSince events before the Big Bang have no observational consequences, one may as well cut them out of the theory, and say that time began at the Big Bang. Events before the Big Bang, are simply not defined, because there's no way one could measure what happened at them. This kind of beginning to the universe, and of time itself, is very different to the beginnings that had been considered earlier. These had to be imposed on the universe by some external agency. There is no dynamical reason why the motion of bodies in the solar system can not be extrapolated back in time, far beyond four thousand and four BC, the date for the creation of the universe, according to the book of Genesis. Thus it would require the direct intervention of God, if the universe began at that date. By contrast, the Big Bang is a beginning that is required by the dynamical laws that govern the universe. It is therefore intrinsic to the universe, and is not imposed on it from outside.", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/Eb8c_302lxs/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/Eb8c_302lxs/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/Eb8c_302lxs/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}, "standard": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/Eb8c_302lxs/sddefault.jpg", "width": 640, "height": 480}}, "channelTitle": "Advexon Science Network", "tags": ["Advexon", "Science", "Network", "Space time", "what is space time", "space time", "what is space time and how it works", "universe", "documentary", "documentary 2019", "space documentary", "advexon documentary", "how the universe works", "how the universe works 2019", "the universe and time", "big bang documentary", "the universe", "documentary hd", "full documentary", "how the universe works fulll episode", "the time and space", "physics", "what is our universe is made of"], "categoryId": "28", "liveBroadcastContent": "none", "defaultLanguage": "en", "localized": {"title": "What is Space Time and How it Works | Documentary", "description": "The time scale of the universe is very long compared to that for human life.

However, many people were unhappy with the idea that the universe had a beginning, because it seemed to imply the existence of a supernatural being who created the universe. They preferred to believe that the universe, and the human race, had existed forever. Their explanation for human progress was that there had been periodic floods, or other natural disasters, which repeatedly set back the human race to a primitive state. \n\nThis argument about whether or not the universe had a beginning, persisted into the 19th and 20th centuries. It was conducted mainly on the basis of theology and philosophy, with little consideration of observational evidence. This may have been reasonable, given the notoriously unreliable character of cosmological observations, until fairly recently. The cosmologist, Sir Arthur Eddington, once said, 'Don't worry if your theory doesn't agree with the observations, because they are probably wrong.' But if your theory disagrees with the Second Law of Thermodynamics, it is in bad trouble. In fact, the theory that the universe has existed forever is in serious difficulty with the Second Law of Thermodynamics. The Second Law, states that disorder always increases with time. Like the argument about human progress, it indicates that there must have been a beginning. Otherwise, the universe would be in a state of complete disorder by now, and everything would be at the same temperature. In an infinite and everlasting universe, every line of sight would end on the surface of a star. This would mean that the night sky would have been as bright as the surface of the Sun. The only way of avoiding this problem would be if, for some reason, the stars did not shine before a certain time. \n\nIn a universe that was essentially static, there would not have been any dynamical reason, why the stars should have suddenly turned on, at some time. Any such \"lighting up time\" would have to be imposed by an intervention from outside the universe. The situation was different, however, when it was realised that the universe is not static, but expanding. Galaxies are moving steadily apart from each other. This means that they were closer together in the past. One can plot the separation of two galaxies, as a function of time. If there were no acceleration due to gravity, the graph would be a straight line. It would go down to zero separation, about twenty billion years ago. One would expect gravity, to cause the galaxies to accelerate towards each other. This will mean that the graph of the separation of two galaxies will bend downwards, below the straight line. So the time of zero separation, would have been less than twenty billion years ago. \n\nAt this time, the Big Bang, all the matter in the universe, would have been on top of itself. The density would have been infinite. It would have been what is called, a singularity. At a singularity, all the laws of physics would have broken down. This means that the state of the universe, after the Big Bang, will not depend on anything that may have happened before, because the deterministic laws that govern the universe will break down in the Big Bang. The universe will evolve from the Big Bang, completely independently of what it was like before. Even the amount of matter in the universe, can be different to what it was before the Big Bang, as the Law of Conservation of Matter, will break down at the Big Bang. \n\nSince events before the Big Bang have no observational consequences, one may as well cut them out of the theory, and say that time began at the Big Bang. Events before the Big Bang, are simply not defined, because there's no way one could measure what happened at them. This kind of beginning to the universe, and of time itself, is very different to the beginnings that had been considered earlier. These had to be imposed on the universe by some external agency. There is no dynamical reason why the motion of bodies in the solar system can not be extrapolated back in time, far beyond four thousand and four BC, the date for the creation of the universe, according to the book of Genesis. Thus it would require the direct intervention of God, if the universe began at that date. By contrast, the Big Bang is a beginning that is required by the dynamical laws that govern the universe. It is therefore intrinsic to the universe, and is not imposed on it from outside."}, "defaultAudioLanguage": "en"}, "contentDetails": {"duration": "PT42M22S", "dimension": "2d", "definition": "sd",

They produced online ad campaigns attacking us, but, it takes more than a banner ad to slow us down.\n\nWe've reissued Koch Brothers Exposed in an updated version, Koch Brothers Exposed: 2014 Edition, to shine a light on them. We've delved even deeper into where their money is going, who their money is hurting, and how much they are making during this whole process leading up to the 2014 Elections. \n\nTwo years ago when we made this film very few people knew who the Koch Brothers were or what the Koch Brothers were doing. But now, we so strongly believe that everyone should know what is happening that with your help and donations we are able to offer the film for free. We want to make sure everyone has an opportunity to see the truth.\n\n(5:11) How the Koch Brothers use Citizens United to corrupt democracy\n\n(7:11) The Koch plan to re-segregate public schools\n\n(17:11)  Koch University:  Rewriting your Education\nIs your school on the list http://www.bravenewfilms.org/koch_getinvolved\n\n(21:02) Kochs VS The Minimum Wage\n\n(25:09) Kochs & Voter Suppression\n\n(31:26) Koch Attacks on Unions\n\n(34:54) The Koch plan to dismantle Social Security\n\n(38:20) Kochs & The Environment\n\n(40:52) How the Koch Brothers Cause Cancer by dumping their toxic waste everywhere\n\n(50:08)  FIGHTING BACK"}, "defaultAudioLanguage": "en"}, "contentDetails": {"duration": "PT55M55S", "dimension": "2d", "definition": "hd", "caption": "true", "licensedContent": true, "projection": "rectangular"}, "statistics": {"viewCount": "632940", "likeCount": "7138", "dislikeCount": "517", "favoriteCount": "0", "commentCount": "2200"}}, {"kind": "youtube#video", "etag": "\"XpPGQXPnxQJhLgs6enD_n8JR4Qk/kWsYcwyo0vLHd68gCzSz40gKunE\"", "id": "Ag9jIsf8ijI", "snippet": {"publishedAt": "2017-06-20T00:02:44.000Z", "channelId": "UCZaT_X_mc0BI-djXOlfhqWQ", "title": "Inside Chechen Prison Where Gay Men Say They Were Tortured  (HBO)", "description": "As international attention narrows on the alleged persecution, torture and killing of homosexual men in Chechnya, VICE News Tonight reports from the conservative Muslim republic - meeting Kheda Saratova, a human rights advisor to the Kadyrov regime, and touring the prison allegedly used to detain and abuse the accused.\n\nRead the full article here: http://bit.ly/2rzcUaR\n\nSubscribe to VICE News here: http://bit.ly/Subscribe-to-VICE-News\n\nCheck out VICE News for more: http://vicenews.com\n\nFollow VICE News here:\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/vicenews\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/vicenews\nTumblr: http://vicenews.tumblr.com/\nInstagram: http://instagram.com/vicenews\nMore videos from the VICE network: https://www.fb.com/vicevideo", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/Ag9jIsf8ijI/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/Ag9jIsf8ijI/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/Ag9jIsf8ijI/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}, "standard": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/Ag9jIsf8ijI/sddefault.jpg", "width": 640, "height": 480}, "maxres": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/Ag9jIsf8ijI/maxresdefault.jpg", "width": 1280, "height": 720}}, "channelTitle": "VICE News", "tags": ["Kheda Saratova", "The Chechen Republic", "gay purge", "Chechnya", "Hind Hassan", "Kadyrov", "ramzan kadyrov", "republican", "happening now", "politics", "national", "international", "environment", "economics", "VICE News Tonight", "HBO", "VICE on HBO", "news", "VICE Money", "VICE News", "VICE", "LGBT", "LGBTQ", "civil rights", "human rights", "VICE Magazine", "Islam", "Muslim republic", "documentary", "interviews", "human rights advisor", "world news", "breaking news", "chechen prison", "chechen prisoners of war"], "categoryId": "25", "liveBroadcastContent": "none", "defaultLanguage": "en", "localized": {"title": "Inside Chechen Prison Where Gay Men Say They Were Tortured  (HBO)", "description": "As international attention narrows on the alleged persecution, torture and killing of homosexual men in Chechnya, VICE News Tonight reports from the conservative Muslim republic - meeting Kheda Saratova, a human rights advisor to the Kadyrov regime, and touring the prison allegedly used to detain and abuse the accused.\n\nRead the full article here: http://bit.ly/2rzcUaR\n\nSubscribe to VICE News here: http://bit.ly/Subscribe-to-VICE-News\n\nCheck out VICE News for more: http://vicenews.com\n\nFollow VICE News here:\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/vicenews\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/vicenews\nTumblr: http://vicenews.tumblr.com/\nInstagram: http://instagram.com/vicenews\nMore videos from the VICE network: https://www.fb.com/vicevideo"}, "defaultAudioLanguage": "en"}, "contentDetails": {"duration": "PT9M2S", "dimension": "2d", "definition": "hd", "caption": "true", "licensedContent": true, "projection": "rectangular"}, "statistics": {"viewCount": "906605", "likeCount": "5849", "dislikeCount": "2289", "favoriteCount": "0", "commentCount": "5536"}}, {"kind": "youtube#video", "etag": "\"XpPGQXPnxQJhLgs6enD_n8JR4Qk/Dwbg9U6IXtDwtF4jj0zYQR3UQK4\"", "id": "1UnIDL-eHOs", "snippet": {"publishedAt": "2018-09-12T11:59:35.000Z", "channelId": "UCLXo7UDZvByw2ixzpQCufnA", "title": "Why we say \u201cOK\u201d", "description": "How a cheesy joke from the 1830s became the most widely spoken word in the world.\n\nSubscribe to our channel! http://goo.gl/0bsAjO\n\nOK is thought to be the most widely recognized word on the planet.

He inspired the creation of several film characters, including Norman Bates ('Psycho'), Jame Gumb ('The Silence of the Lambs'), Leatherface ('Texas Chainsaw Massacre') and the new Leatherface (2017).\nObsessively devoted to his mother until her death in 1945, Gein never left home or dated women. After she died, he became increasingly deranged and eventually began prowling cemeteries to unearth recently buried female corpses. He would cut off body parts and keep them as trophies, returning the corpses seemingly undisturbed to their graves. In 1954, Ed Gein turned from grave robbing to murder, a task he was less meticulous about. Police implicated him in the murders of two women in 1957. During the investigations, police learned that he had practiced necrophilia and experimented with human taxidermy.\n\nThat same year, Gein pleaded not guilty by reason by insanity. He was found unfit to stand trial and committed to a mental hospital for criminals. Nearly ten years later, he would be declared fit to stand trial and was ultimately found guilty of murder. He was confined in various criminal psychiatric institutions, including the Central State Hospital in Wisconsin and the Mendota Mental Health Institute, where he died of respiratory and heart failure due to cancer, on July 26, 1984, at age 77.\n\n#leatherface #leatherface2017\n#serialkillers #serialkiller #serialkillersdocumentaries Thank you for helping me reach 50.000 subscribers.

He inspired the creation of several film characters, including Norman Bates ('Psycho'), Jame Gumb ('The Silence of the Lambs'), Leatherface ('Texas Chainsaw Massacre') and the new Leatherface (2017).\nObsessively devoted to his mother until her death in 1945, Gein never left home or dated women. After she died, he became increasingly deranged and eventually began prowling cemeteries to unearth recently buried female corpses. He would cut off body parts and keep them as trophies, returning the corpses seemingly undisturbed to their graves.

Notable for its centerfolds of nude and semi-nude models (Playmates), Playboy played an important role in the sexual revolution and remains one of the world's best-known brands.\n\nToday it has grown into Playboy Enterprises, Inc., with a presence in nearly every medium. In addition to the flagship magazine in the United States, special nation-specific versions of Playboy are published worldwide. After a year-long removal of most nude photos in Playboy magazine, the March-April 2017 issue brought back nudity.\n\nThe magazine generally reflects a liberal editorial stance, although it often interviews conservative celebrities. One of its most famous content categories was its interview section, where Playboy journalists interviewed various famous public figures.\n\nUnder the kind patronage of Samuel Patterson."}, "defaultAudioLanguage": "en"}, "contentDetails": {"duration": "PT11M21S", "dimension": "2d", "definition": "hd", "caption": "true", "licensedContent": true, "projection": "rectangular"}, "statistics": {"viewCount": "416088", "likeCount": "5827", "dislikeCount": "309", "favoriteCount": "0", "commentCount": "358"}}, {"kind": "youtube#video", "etag": "\"XpPGQXPnxQJhLgs6enD_n8JR4Qk/e84CyTbTXgK1ODwtsa48zBe9WQQ\"", "id": "8v_lDlFpCuo", "snippet": {"publishedAt": "2016-06-03T17:56:46.000Z", "channelId": "UCVmA428QXYdGckmuGhW68FQ", "title": "Inside the American Mob S01E01 Stayin' Alive in the '70s HD", "description": "In the early 1970s, a hidden empire of crime, violence and power ruled the streets of New York City.

Extended", "description": "We unexpectedly found missing footage of two more scenes from the building process - moss collection in the local swamp and finishing of the frame. So we decided to make another version - extended edition (2 mins longer) to add those scenes to the movie and share them with you all.\n\nThis is a documentary movie uncovering the process of building a wooden house with mostly hand tools from (as much as possible) local natural materials starting from forest till the living space.\n\n\"I built my house from trees that I felled in winter time (-20C) with an axe and two man crosscut saw in my own forest. I did it following the research of old carpenter's calendar that coniferous trees should be felled in January's first days when the new moon rises and the deciduous trees should be felled in the winter time during the old moon. In winter time trees are sleeping and the juice and moisture content is very low in them. As time passes timber felled in winter becomes light and strong.\n\nIn the building process I used mostly traditional carpenters hand tools - axes, hand saws, timber framing chisels and slicks, old Stanley planes, augers, draw knives and mostly human energy. All the ground work for fundaments and the basement earth digging was done by hand with shovels. The foundation consists mostly of bigger and smaller rocks and boulders. Lime, sand and concrete mixture are using only in small amounts - to hold the boulders together. The visible part over the ground level - boulder mosaic has been masoned with hand split local granite.\n\nThe House has been built based on the western part of Latvia - Kurland/Kurzeme (German influence) historical wooden architecture typical technique - Timber Frame construction with sliding log walls between the posts. House is two carpentry technique union - Timber Frame (that is typical in France, Germany, Great Britain, North America and other countries) and traditional Latvian log building technique, between the logs using moss from the local swamp.\nIn the walls, timber frame and roof construction there I used only wood joints and wooden pegs to hold the main construction together - no nails, screws or steel plates. Walls are insulated with 250mm thick dry pine and larch shaving layer (leftover from the local cabinet makers workshop). Overall exterior wall thickness is 50cm. In the walls (except wind vapour breathable membrane over the roof) has not been used any plastic or modern synthetic materials.\n\nTo preserve the wood from the spoiling, fame posts, sills, top beams and final cladding boards are treated with fire and pine tar mixed with Tung oil. This wood preservation technique was adapted from the Japanese traditional wood preservation technique Shou Sugi Ban (\u713c\u6749\u677f).\nExterior cladding boards recoating each 10-15 years with Tung oil and pine or birch tar mixture, the house can last more than 500 years.

Overall amount of shingles used is 15 000 pieces. Roof walls are insulated with ecological wood fibre wool and wood fibre panels. Over the wood fibre panels are plastered natural plaster - mixture of sand, clay powder, lime, linen fibre, salt, wheat flour. Overall thickness of the plaster is 20mm and over all amount of plaster used on the walls are 5000 kilos.

To heat up both floors of the house, when outside it is minus 10 degrees (Celsium) only small oven is heated once a day. When freeze gets below -15, -20 C, we heat up the bread oven. Once it is heated, because of it\u2019s thermal mass of 5 tons, it keeps the warmth 2-3 days. To heat up all the house (120 sq/m) in the winter time we use not more than 4 m3 (1.1 cord) of dry firewood.

Extended", "description": "We unexpectedly found missing footage of two more scenes from the building process - moss collection in the local swamp and finishing of the frame. So we decided to make another version - extended edition (2 mins longer) to add those scenes to the movie and share them with you all.\n\nThis is a documentary movie uncovering the process of building a wooden house with mostly hand tools from (as much as possible) local natural materials starting from forest till the living space.\n\n\"I built my house from trees that I felled in winter time (-20C) with an axe and two man crosscut saw in my own forest. I did it following the research of old carpenter's calendar that coniferous trees should be felled in January's first days when the new moon rises and the deciduous trees should be felled in the winter time during the old moon. In winter time trees are sleeping and the juice and moisture content is very low in them. As time passes timber felled in winter becomes light and strong.\n\nIn the building process I used mostly traditional carpenters hand tools - axes, hand saws, timber framing chisels and slicks, old Stanley planes, augers, draw knives and mostly human energy. All the ground work for fundaments and the basement earth digging was done by hand with shovels. The foundation consists mostly of bigger and smaller rocks and boulders. Lime, sand and concrete mixture are using only in small amounts - to hold the boulders together. The visible part over the ground level - boulder mosaic has been masoned with hand split local granite.\n\nThe House has been built based on the western part of Latvia - Kurland/Kurzeme (German influence) historical wooden architecture typical technique - Timber Frame construction with sliding log walls between the posts. House is two carpentry technique union - Timber Frame (that is typical in France, Germany, Great Britain, North America and other countries) and traditional Latvian log building technique, between the logs using moss from the local swamp.\nIn the walls, timber frame and roof construction there I used only wood joints and wooden pegs to hold the main construction together - no nails, screws or steel plates. Walls are insulated with 250mm thick dry pine and larch shaving layer (leftover from the local cabinet makers workshop). Overall exterior wall thickness is 50cm. In the walls (except wind vapour breathable membrane over the roof) has not been used any plastic or modern synthetic materials.\n\nTo preserve the wood from the spoiling, fame posts, sills, top beams and final cladding boards are treated with fire and pine tar mixed with Tung oil. This wood preservation technique was adapted from the Japanese traditional wood preservation technique Shou Sugi Ban (\u713c\u6749\u677f).\nExterior cladding boards recoating each 10-15 years with Tung oil and pine or birch tar mixture, the house can last more than 500 years. As an example is taken Norwegian stave churches that stands more than 500 years until nowadays.\n\nRoofing is three layer white oak shingles (each 10mm thick, 120mm wide and 720mm long) laid in two directional technique. Overall amount of shingles used is 15 000 pieces. Roof walls are insulated with ecological wood fibre wool and wood fibre panels. Over the wood fibre panels are plastered natural plaster - mixture of sand, clay powder, lime, linen fibre, salt, wheat flour.

A common thread in these theories is the government\u2019s role in staging the tragedy with the help of mainstream news, in order to manipulate the general population.

Massive, floating self-sufficient cities headed towards exotic destinations have been a huge draw for vacationers for several decades.\nHowever, such a world of leisure and luxury is not without a shady underbelly. Since 2000, there have been 313 documented cases of people going missing from cruise vessels, with only about 10 percent of those cases resolved. And because cruise lines are not legally required to make public every case of a person who goes missing or overboard, it is estimated by some in the industry that only around 15-20 percent of such cases are documented and become public via media reports.\nOne such case that did go public, but remains thoroughly disturbing and baffling, is that of Rebecca Coriam, last seen aboard the cruise ship Disney Wonder on March 22, 2011.\n\n\u25baRebecca Coriam 2019 Documentary | A Disney Cover Up?\n\u25baSubscribe for weekly videos! \n\nThanks a lot for taking the time out of your day to watch this video.

Massive, floating self-sufficient cities headed towards exotic destinations have been a huge draw for vacationers for several decades.\nHowever, such a world of leisure and luxury is not without a shady underbelly. Since 2000, there have been 313 documented cases of people going missing from cruise vessels, with only about 10 percent of those cases resolved. And because cruise lines are not legally required to make public every case of a person who goes missing or overboard, it is estimated by some in the industry that only around 15-20 percent of such cases are documented and become public via media reports.\nOne such case that did go public, but remains thoroughly disturbing and baffling, is that of Rebecca Coriam, last seen aboard the cruise ship Disney Wonder on March 22, 2011.\n\n\u25baRebecca Coriam 2019 Documentary | A Disney Cover Up?\n\u25baSubscribe for weekly videos! \n\nThanks a lot for taking the time out of your day to watch this video.

As the story made national news, reporters dug into Goldstein's past and found that he had been diagnosed with schizophrenia and had a history of violent episodes. He had been in and out of psychiatric facilities, but his caretakers had repeatedly released him back onto the streets against their better judgment because of a shortage of available beds.\n\nThe murder of Kendra Webdale brought attention to Americans with severe mental health problems and inadequate treatment, a social problem that 20 years later is still ongoing. Prisons and jails are filled with inmates who exhibit symptoms of mental illness. So do many of the homeless people crowding the streets of cities like Los Angeles, San Francisco, and New York. Violent episodes, like the Webdale murder and some recent mass shootings, have brought renewed calls to entrust the state with more authority to force psychiatric care on patients against their will.\n\nThis story looks at the history of mental illness, institutionalization, and the role of coercion in psychiatry. It features an array of voices and viewpoints, including Linda Mayo, the mother of twin daughers with severe psychiatric diagnoses, who advocates for court-ordered psychiatric treatment; Richard Krzyzanowski, a patients' rights advocate who fights against coercive treatment laws; DJ Jaffe, the founder of Mental Illness Policy Org., who argues that the state should make it much easier to commit mental patients; the late Thomas Szasz, a controversial libertarian psychiatrist who fought compulsory treatment and questioned the very existence of mental illness; and Scott Zeller, a psychiatrist who's developed a new model that he hopes will reduce coercion in the system.

Or does forced treatment free the ill \"from the Bastille of their psychosis?\"\n\n---------\nSubscribe to our YouTube channel: http://youtube.com/reasontv\nLike us on Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/Reason.Magaz...\nFollow us on Twitter: https://twitter.com/reason\nSubscribe to our podcast at iTunes: https://goo.gl/az3a7a\n\nReason is the planet's leading source of news, politics, and culture from a libertarian perspective. Go to reason.com for a point of view you won't get from legacy media and old left-right opinion magazines.\n---------\n\nOn January 3, 1999, Andrew Goldstein wandered onto a New York City subway platform and shoved a stranger named Kendra Webdale into the path of an oncoming train. As the story made national news, reporters dug into Goldstein's past and found that he had been diagnosed with schizophrenia and had a history of violent episodes. He had been in and out of psychiatric facilities, but his caretakers had repeatedly released him back onto the streets against their better judgment because of a shortage of available beds.\n\nThe murder of Kendra Webdale brought attention to Americans with severe mental health problems and inadequate treatment, a social problem that 20 years later is still ongoing. Prisons and jails are filled with inmates who exhibit symptoms of mental illness. So do many of the homeless people crowding the streets of cities like Los Angeles, San Francisco, and New York. Violent episodes, like the Webdale murder and some recent mass shootings, have brought renewed calls to entrust the state with more authority to force psychiatric care on patients against their will.\n\nThis story looks at the history of mental illness, institutionalization, and the role of coercion in psychiatry. It features an array of voices and viewpoints, including Linda Mayo, the mother of twin daughers with severe psychiatric diagnoses, who advocates for court-ordered psychiatric treatment; Richard Krzyzanowski, a patients' rights advocate who fights against coercive treatment laws; DJ Jaffe, the founder of Mental Illness Policy Org., who argues that the state should make it much easier to commit mental patients; the late Thomas Szasz, a controversial libertarian psychiatrist who fought compulsory treatment and questioned the very existence of mental illness; and Scott Zeller, a psychiatrist who's developed a new model that he hopes will reduce coercion in the system. (Disclosure: Zeller has in the past donated to Reason Foundation, the 501c3 that publishes Reason.)\n\nProduced by Zach Weissmueller.

Why didn't you talk about good cop bad cop?  \nA. It seems that while good cop bad cop may be used, it isn't officially endorsed in an interrogation, and isn't part of official training.  The presence of it in hollywood movies is way overblown, because it plays into their \"high-adrenaline, highly visual\" style. \n\nQ. Is this the only interrogation technique there is?\nA. No, the Reid technique is the main interrogation technique in America but it has recently come under fire for producing false confessions.  See this great New Yorker article: [https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2013/12/09/the-interview-7].

A huge part of it hinges on the idea that a cop can \"tell\" when you're lying, which is the justification for applying so much pressure during the accusation portion.  In recent years this claim has fallen under a lot of scrutiny.  Body language isn't as reliable of a signal of lying as we thought.  This is one of many criticisms of the Reid technique.  \n\nQ.

The U.S. Military had been experiment with the aerial aircraft carrier concepts for nearly half a century. In the early 1930s, two U.S. Navy airships, the USS Akron and the USS Macon carried up to 5 planes stored inside an internal hangar bay. These airborne aircraft carriers enhanced the Navy\u2019s seaborne scouting ability, and the airships\u2019 onboard planes could be deployed for further scouting or defensive purposes. But both USS Akron and Macon were destroyed in weather related accidents not even 3 years after their introductions, helping to put an end to any future airship-based aircraft carriers. But the experiments continued in the 1940s, this time spurred on by a need to protect long-range intercontinental bombers. A seemingly sensible solution to extending escort fighter range was to have long-range bombers carry escort fighters onboard which could be deployed and recovered when needed. But the promising concept proved far more difficult in reality, with aircraft recovery being a particularly dangerous endeavor. Multiple docking methods were attempted, but only one version using a trapeze mechanism and a full-sized fighter ever saw limited service. By the mid-1950s, aerial refueling had proven itself to be a far more practical and safe solution to extending aircraft range.\nYet, the Air Force reexamined the concept again in the early 1970s.

And furthermore, the trust that Donald set up, the sons have said they tell dad what's going on in the business,\" says David Cay Johnston, editor of DC Report and author of The Making of Donald Trump and It's Even Worse Than You Think.\n\n\"He can reach in and withdraw money at any time. Whether or not he has done so, we don't know. But this is not anything at all like a blind trust. This is like what you expect to see in a family business posing as a country,\" he adds.\n\nThe overlap between Trump's business activities and his role as president has given rise to allegations that he is leveraging his office for personal gain.\n\nThese charges are laid out in a series of lawsuits, which allege that Trump is violating the Emoluments Clauses of the US Constitution, by accepting payments or benefits from foreign states as well as federal and state governments.\n\nThe attorney general for the District of Columbia, Karl Racine, calls the Emoluments Clauses the United States' \"oldest anti-corruption law.\"\n\nWith the attorney general of Maryland, Racine has brought a lawsuit (known as D.C. and Maryland v. Trump) focused on the Trump International Hotel in Washington, DC, and the payments or benefits from foreign and domestic governments the president may be receiving there.\n\nFault Lines examines how the president's business dealings may have put him in conflict with the US constitution. And in a fractious mid-term election season, we ask constitutional law scholars and international corruption experts why it matters for democracy in the US."}, "defaultAudioLanguage": "en"}, "contentDetails": {"duration": "PT26M6S", "dimension": "2d", "definition": "hd", "caption": "false", "licensedContent": true, "projection": "rectangular"}, "statistics": {"viewCount": "25830", "likeCount": "256", "dislikeCount": "57", "favoriteCount": "0", "commentCount": "123"}}, {"kind": "youtube#video", "etag": "\"XpPGQXPnxQJhLgs6enD_n8JR4Qk/vC3iKjSoO_C240IidxaVWXCghRM\"", "id": "xO8uhme0o3Y", "snippet": {"publishedAt": "2015-02-12T22:10:26.000Z", "channelId": "UC5bT_PPHhPiU-KQsaDnBzgg", "title": "Apocalypse World War 1 1of5", "description": "Series about World War 1.", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/xO8uhme0o3Y/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/xO8uhme0o3Y/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/xO8uhme0o3Y/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}, "standard": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/xO8uhme0o3Y/sddefault.jpg", "width": 640, "height": 480}}, "channelTitle": "war-history", "tags": ["War", "World war 1", "War-history"], "categoryId": "25", "liveBroadcastContent": "none", "localized": {"title": "Apocalypse World War 1 1of5", "description": "Series about World War 1."}}, "contentDetails": {"duration": "PT52M1S", "dimension": "2d", "definition": "sd", "caption": "false", "licensedContent": false, "regionRestriction": {"blocked": ["GP", "MQ", "GF", "NC", "RE", "BL", "FR", "MF", "PF", "MC", "YT", "WF", "PM", "AD"]}, "projection": "rectangular"}, "statistics": {"viewCount": "1444120", "likeCount": "6638", "dislikeCount": "332", "favoriteCount": "0", "commentCount": "1409"}}, {"kind": "youtube#video", "etag": "\"XpPGQXPnxQJhLgs6enD_n8JR4Qk/oXGf4U8VGUt9TDPxe8GE1vPYV5E\"", "id": "5rZoxMf-y1A", "snippet": {"publishedAt": "2019-02-11T10:58:02.000Z", "channelId": "UCMo2mMJd4sY9XgMXvTM5mAQ", "title": "The War Against Solar Energy | Spark Sketch", "description": "From bringing millions of people out from their energy poverty to preventing the further depletion of the ozone layer, solar energy is a key solution to a majority of humanity's problems. \nThe shift to solar power has become the primary goal of many nations across the globe. \n\nBut what's more important than saving the earth from catastrophic environmental degradation?

And that meant flying across the country\u2019s vast territory required multiple stops for refueling. The exhausting flight could take could take over 24 hours and require multiple stops for refueling. The need for a new Soviet airliner was clearly pressing, especially since the country\u2019s new leader Nikita Khrushchev had a much more open stance with the West and plans for visits around the world. \n \n In 1955 the Tupolev Design Bureau was given a directive to convert the Tu-95 intercontinental strategic bomber into an airliner. It would be the quickest way to build the Soviet Union a new long-range airliner. Two parallel projects were launched. The first aimed to minimally modify the Tu-95 and convert it into a VIP transport for Soviet Heads of State (Tu-116). A second, more ambitious project aimed to turn the Tu-95 into a proper airliner (Tu-114). \n \nThe Tu-114 was significantly modified, but still retained the Tu-95\u2019s powerful turboprop engines and swept wings, which were mounted lower to accommodate a wider fuselage. Other design changes include larger flaps, a taller nose gear and new stabilizers. The Tu-116 airliner is most notable for its incredible maximum speed of 880 km/h (550 mph), which is comparable to modern-day jet-powered airliners.

And that meant flying across the country\u2019s vast territory required multiple stops for refueling. The exhausting flight could take could take over 24 hours and require multiple stops for refueling. The need for a new Soviet airliner was clearly pressing, especially since the country\u2019s new leader Nikita Khrushchev had a much more open stance with the West and plans for visits around the world. \n \n In 1955 the Tupolev Design Bureau was given a directive to convert the Tu-95 intercontinental strategic bomber into an airliner. It would be the quickest way to build the Soviet Union a new long-range airliner. Two parallel projects were launched. The first aimed to minimally modify the Tu-95 and convert it into a VIP transport for Soviet Heads of State (Tu-116). A second, more ambitious project aimed to turn the Tu-95 into a proper airliner (Tu-114). \n \nThe Tu-114 was significantly modified, but still retained the Tu-95\u2019s powerful turboprop engines and swept wings, which were mounted lower to accommodate a wider fuselage. Other design changes include larger flaps, a taller nose gear and new stabilizers. The Tu-116 airliner is most notable for its incredible maximum speed of 880 km/h (550 mph), which is comparable to modern-day jet-powered airliners. It also boasted a very impressive (for it\u2019s day) range of 10,900 km (6,800 mi). Early versions were configured in a three-class layout, which was rather unconventional for a Soviet Airliner. Features included, large tables, private sleeping cabins and a dining lounge served by a full-size kitchen in the lower deck .

Georgia governor George Gilmer, as well as most of the Georgia legislature, made it very clear they wanted the Cherokee out of the state. \n\nIn 1827, the Cherokee Nation formally established a constitutional government and declared themselves sovereign, meaning American laws didn\u2019t apply to them. This, of course, angered governor Gilmer and the legislature, and they annexed all Cherokee land in the state, dismantled the Cherokee government, and redistributed much of their land to white citizens. \n\nNot only that, but three years later Congress passed and President Andrew Jackson signed the Indian Removal Act, which gave the President the power to negotiate treaties to remove Native Americans from their lands.\n\nWhile all of this was going on, white missionaries were working with the Cherokee Nation to help them defend their sovereignty and continue to resist the Georgia laws that was kicking them off their own land.

Georgia governor George Gilmer, as well as most of the Georgia legislature, made it very clear they wanted the Cherokee out of the state. \n\nIn 1827, the Cherokee Nation formally established a constitutional government and declared themselves sovereign, meaning American laws didn\u2019t apply to them. This, of course, angered governor Gilmer and the legislature, and they annexed all Cherokee land in the state, dismantled the Cherokee government, and redistributed much of their land to white citizens. \n\nNot only that, but three years later Congress passed and President Andrew Jackson signed the Indian Removal Act, which gave the President the power to negotiate treaties to remove Native Americans from their lands.\n\nWhile all of this was going on, white missionaries were working with the Cherokee Nation to help them defend their sovereignty and continue to resist the Georgia laws that was kicking them off their own land. The Georgia legislature didn\u2019t like this so much, so they passed a law that specifically banned \u201cwhite persons\u201d from living with the Cherokee without special permission from the state. \n\nBut several of these missionaries were rebels, you could say- they refused to leave. Two of them who refused to leave were Elizur Butler, a doctor from Connecticut, and Samuel Worcester,a minister from Vermont.

The future may look bleak, but we have enormous potential as a species. \n\nFeaturing the voices of David Attenborough, Craig Childs, Brian Cox, Neil deGrasse Tyson, Michelle Thaller, Lawrence Krauss, Michio Kaku, Mike Rowe, Phil Plait, Janna Levin, Stephen Hawking, Sean Carroll, Alex Filippenko, and Martin Rees.\n\nBig thanks to Protocol Labs for their support of this creation: https://protocol.ai/ \n\nAnd to my Patreon supporters: Juan Benet, Kalexan, Laine Boswell, Holly, Dave & Debbie Boswell, Abraxas, Alina Sigaeva, Aksel Tj\u00f8nn, Daniel Saltzman, Crystal, Eico Neumann, geekiskhan, Giulia Carrozzino, Hannah Murphy, Jeremy Kerwin, JousterL, Lars St\u00f8ttrup Nielsen, Leonard van Vliet, Mitchel Mattera, Nathan Paskett, Patrick Cullen, Randall Bollig, Roman Shishkin, Silas Rech, Stefan Stettner, The Cleaner, Timothy E Plum, Virtual_271, Westin Johnson, Yannic, and Anna & Tyson.\n\nSoundtrack now available: https://bit.ly/2HKl9fi and coming soon to iTunes/Spotify/Etc\n\nPeace and love,\n\nmelodysheep\n@musicalscience\nmelodysheep.com\n\nConcept, music, writing, edit, and visual effects by melodysheep, with additional visual material sourced from:\n\nNASA Goddard\nGoogle\nSpaceX\n2012\nGeostorm\nInto the Universe with Stephen Hawking\nBMW X1 \nJourney to the Edge of the Universe\nNoah\nHow the Universe Works\nDeep Impact\nWonders of the Universe\nMoon raker vfx reel\nVoyage of Time\n\nVoice sample sources:\n\nAttenborough Davos Speech https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xuudPum21nE\nCraig Childs -

As matter of fact, since the Civil War North Carolina had only elected a total of 4 African Americans to the U.S. House of Representatives. After the 1990 census, North Carolina gained a district, so they were going to get a new Representative. The state legislature was like, we need an African American to represent this district, so they intentionally created a district made up of mostly African Americans under the assumption they would vote one in. After the legislature submitted their plans to the U.S. Department of Justice, Attorney General Janet Reno was like \u201cnah, not good enough,\u201d and rejected them, saying there needed to be another district where minorities would have a chance to represent constituents in order to comply with the Voting Rights Act.\n\nSo the state legislature went back to the drawing board, this time drawing up another district to help get another African American to represent North Carolina in Congress. Now, this district was a bit...odd shaped. I mean, just look at it here. It ran along Interstate 85 for 160 miles, breaking up counties and towns and grouping together places that typically were NOT grouped together. In some places, the district was only as wide as the highway itself.\n\nAnd well...wouldn\u2019t you know it...in 1992 residents of both of those redrawn districts elected African Americans to represent them. Both were North Carolina\u2019s first African Americans to get into Congress in the 20th century. \n\nWell this made some North Carolina folks upset, you could say. They said that those districts were racially gerrymandered to get African Americans elected there. In case you didn\u2019t know, gerrymandering means manipulating how the boundaries of districts are drawn to either favor one group or hurt another group. Gerrymandering is something of an infamous American tradition. As much as Americans hate the practice, it\u2019s been around since the early days of the country. It was named after a dude named Elbridge Gerry (I know, his name is pronounced differently), who, as governor, signed the bill that approved a weirdly shaped district that benefitted his political party in the state of Massachusetts. The district\u2019s shape somewhat resembled a salamander. So get it? Gerry which turned into Gerry plus salamander equals gerrymander? \n\nAnyway, in this case, five North Carolina residents, led by a person named Ruth Shaw, sued both the state and the federal government, arguing that District 12, in particular, was gerrymandered so much that it went against the 14th Amendment\u2019s tubular Equal Protection Clause. Again, they argued it was racial gerrymandering, not political gerrymandering, and they argued the drawn district didn\u2019t go against the \u201cone person, one vote\u201d established in the case Reynolds v. Sims. \n\nArguments kept coming back to whether or not North Carolina\u2019s redistricting plan went against the Equal Protection Clause of the 14th Amendment.", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/M7deA_OAbwQ/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/M7deA_OAbwQ/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/M7deA_OAbwQ/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}, "standard": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/M7deA_OAbwQ/sddefault.jpg", "width": 640, "height": 480}, "maxres": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/M7deA_OAbwQ/maxresdefault.jpg", "width": 1280, "height": 720}}, "channelTitle": "Mr. Beat", "tags": ["Shaw vs. Reno", "crash course gerrymandering", "shaw v reno explained", "shaw v reno ap gov", "shaw v reno hip hughes", "Mr. Beat Supreme Court Briefs", "shaw v reno documentary", "Supreme Court gerrymandering", "Gerrymandering explained", "supreme court redistricting cases", "racial gerrymandering", "Supreme Court gerrymandering ruling", "shaw v reno 1993", "supreme court cases for dummies", "partisan gerrymandering", "arnold schwarzenegger gerrymandering", "attempts to end gerrymandering", "gerrymandering"], "categoryId": "27", "liveBroadcastContent": "none", "localized": {"title": "Is Gerrymandering Legal? | Shaw v.

But this train is unlike any other before it. Instead of rolling on train wheels, it hovers on a cushion of air. In the 1970\u2019s hovertrains were seriously being considered the solution to slow, antiquated railways, which increasingly had to compete with new superhighways and even intercity air travel. \n\nWithout the rolling resistance of train wheels, hovertrains promised greater efficiency and much higher speeds. By feeding high pressure air through lifting pads, hovertrains float on a cushion of air much like a hovercraft. \n\nOne of the most widely known hovertrain prototypes was called the Aerotrain. Lead engineer Jean Bertin and his team in France, designed several versions, including one that could carry 80 passengers. The i80HV was powered by a turbofan sourced from an airliner, producing over twelve thousand pounds of thrust.   At the front, a 400 horse power gas-turbine supplied high-pressure air to hover the twenty loaded train a quarter of an inch off its guideway. The British and Americans also experimented with hovertrain technology, incorporating the linear induction motor for improved efficiency. British research led to the development of the RTV-31 Tracked Hovercraft, and the American\u2019s developed several prototypes, culminating in the development of the Urban Tracked Air Cushion Vehicle (UTACV). \n\nBut like their counterpart the Maglev, Hovertrains failed to revolutionize rail. Hovertrains, Maglevs, or any other innovative alternative to rail has to compete with nearly a million miles of rail line already in existence. With stations and infrastructure built-out in nearly every city in the world. The limitations of conventional railways were overcome not a single innovative leap forward, but by incremental improvements. Existing rail networks were modernized with sections of track that could handle higher speeds.

The desperate teenagers wear high heels and pay a bribe to get in. Their ultimate hope is Mzungu, a white man who will pay 5 times more for sex than a Kenyan labourer can earn in a day. \"I started when I was 12. I could go into a nightclub and I could count 10 to 20 girls that were prostitutes,\" tells 14-year-old prostitute Leyla. \"I ask God, what I have done wrong?

New science is revealing that trees are far more dynamic than we ever realized, with a highly sociable nature and a penchant for generosity, allowing them to form vibrant communities.\n\nIn What Trees Talk About, host David Suzuki and scientists working in boreal regions around the world investigate the many unexpected ways that the trees of the boreal forest communicate with each other, form friendships with neighbouring animals, and team up to face the elements.\n\nThe boreal is the Earth\u2019s largest land-based biome, covering over half of Canada\u2019s land mass. Its extreme environment, with temperatures ranging from -50 degrees Celsius in the winter to a blazing +40 in the summer, places a high demand on the flora and fauna of the region: adapt to survive. Recent studies have led scientists to discover that not only can the boreal\u2019s trees withstand these conditions \u2014 they are some of the most dynamic and influential life forms on the planet.\n\nWhat Trees Talk About offers a fresh perspective, debunking the common myth that trees are inactive, solitary beings. \u201cWe have this general idea that trees are independent individuals,\u201d says ecologist Annie Desrochers, \u201cBut what we have discovered is that they\u2019re not independent, they will form unions.\u201d\n\nUsing a \u2018science in action\u2019 approach, the film takes viewers on a fascinating journey into the heart of the boreal, revealing the hidden social connections that allow trees to thrive in harsh conditions, from sharing food and water through their roots to starving out the squirrels that stand in the way of reproduction - even banding together to change the weather.\n\nDirector Ryszard Hunka brings us to forests around the world, using CGI animation to uncover the complex systems that allow boreal trees to thrive, in turn playing a key role in sustaining all life on earth. Each of the featured scientists brings an infectious enthusiasm to their study of the northern forest, but also an undercurrent of concern: will this force of nature, which has been integral to the health of our planet for over 10,000 years, still be self-sufficient in the onslaught of climate change?\n\nBiologist Jill Johnstone believes it\u2019s in our best interests to find out: \u201cWhat happens in the boreal doesn\u2019t necessarily stay in the boreal - it\u2019s important to all of us.\u201d \n\nMore Shows:\nhttp://bit.ly/CBCDocs-WatchMore\n\nStay Connected:\nTwitter: http://bit.ly/CBCDocs-Twitter\nFacebook: http://bit.ly/CBCDocs-Facebook\nInstagram: http://bit.ly/CBCDocs-Instagram", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/_LFvL_iYVaY/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/_LFvL_iYVaY/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/_LFvL_iYVaY/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}, "standard": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/_LFvL_iYVaY/sddefault.jpg", "width": 640, "height": 480}, "maxres": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/_LFvL_iYVaY/maxresdefault.jpg", "width": 1280, "height": 720}}, "channelTitle": "CBC Docs", "tags": ["What Trees Talk About", "The Nature of Things", "David Suzuki", "boreal forest", "nature", "CGI animation", "scientists", "Yukon", "Ryszard Hunka", "Annie Desrochers", "Finland", "Algonquin Park", "Grey Jays", "whiskey jack", "birdwatching"], "categoryId": "28", "liveBroadcastContent": "none", "localized": {"title": "What Trees Talk About: A revealing look at the secret life of trees  - The Nature of Things", "description": "What Trees Talk About takes a revealing look at the secret life of trees - how they communicate, wage war, and work together to transform our world. #TheNatureOfThings\n\n\u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \n\nCombining spectacular panoramic visuals with high-end CGI, this stunning nature documentary explores the secret life of trees, and how the world\u2019s last great forest has the power to shape not only the lives of the plants and animals that live within it but our lives and life across the entire globe.

Downloading is encouraged. \nWatch in 720 or 1080p\n\nNews Release: Feb. 4, 2013\n\nFilmmaker turns to DVD pirates to foster healing in traumatized Kenya.\n\nFor Drury University Filmmaker in Residence Patrick Mureithi, his message is more important than box-office receipts.\n\nWhen it came time to spread his documentary \"Kenya: Until Hope Is Found\" throughout his home country in December of 2012, he didn't approach movie theaters. He turned to DVD pirates.\n\nTo reach as many people as possible, Mureithi gave the film to street vendors who, since then, have been selling, and in some cases, giving the film away. He receives no royalties from these sales. \"My reasoning was that since they have the most efficient distribution system in Kenya, then they would be able to get the film into as many hands as possible,\" said Mureithi. \"As I type, their vendors are selling the film country-wide for less than 80 shillings (approx $1).\"\n\nMureithi started this project after the 2007/8 post-election violence in Kenya left more than 1,200 people dead and 500,000 displaced in his home country. His goal: To understand how to confront unresolved trauma and heal \u2014 before the March 2013 elections.

Downloading is encouraged. \nWatch in 720 or 1080p\n\nNews Release: Feb. 4, 2013\n\nFilmmaker turns to DVD pirates to foster healing in traumatized Kenya.\n\nFor Drury University Filmmaker in Residence Patrick Mureithi, his message is more important than box-office receipts.\n\nWhen it came time to spread his documentary \"Kenya: Until Hope Is Found\" throughout his home country in December of 2012, he didn't approach movie theaters. He turned to DVD pirates.\n\nTo reach as many people as possible, Mureithi gave the film to street vendors who, since then, have been selling, and in some cases, giving the film away. He receives no royalties from these sales. \"My reasoning was that since they have the most efficient distribution system in Kenya, then they would be able to get the film into as many hands as possible,\" said Mureithi. \"As I type, their vendors are selling the film country-wide for less than 80 shillings (approx $1).\"\n\nMureithi started this project after the 2007/8 post-election violence in Kenya left more than 1,200 people dead and 500,000 displaced in his home country. His goal: To understand how to confront unresolved trauma and heal \u2014 before the March 2013 elections. He has released an early version of the 60-minute documentary in advance of the upcoming elections in an effort to stave off another round of violence. Film critic Roger Ebert called the work \"an urgent documentary by a filmmaker I admire.\"\n\nThe documentary, also available on youtube, follows severely traumatized men and women in Kibera, Kenya's largest slum and the epicenter of the post-election violence, as they go through a workshop together called \"Healing and Rebuilding Our Communities.\" The workshop is hosted by the Alternatives to Violence Project Kenya, a Quaker initiative of the Friends Peace Teams.

What is it, that makes the North Pole so attractive that superpowers fight for supremacy? Climate change on the North Pole has not only caused more water, but also the possibility for ships to sail on new routes. A documentary that shows how the North pole has become a new battlefield, where superpowers look for economic growth and the Arctic people try to survive.\n\nThe ice in the North Pole is melting due to climate change, which also means that waterways are released in the summer that leads ships to raw materials that could not be extracted in earlier days. A run of superpowers on nickel and gold mines has sharpened geopolitical relationships and has major consequences for the lives of the Arctic people. A report in pictures, by photographers Kadir van Lohuizen and Yuri Kozyrev.\n \nThe Russian photographer Yuri Kozyrev and the Dutch photographer Kadir van Lohuizen traveled to the North Pole. The two photographers explored different areas. They recorded their journey in photos and on video and talked to the people they met along the way. Van Lohuizen visited the western part of the Arctic, where he meets the original inhabitants of the North Pole - the Inuit. They take him on a whale hunt and explain how the melting ice threatens their livelihood. He also travels with the Canadian army and joins the US Coast Guard at the North Pole, which monitors the shipping routes that have resulted out of the melting ice.\n \nMilitary presence is growing as in the Arctic the battle for oil, gas, and minerals has begun. And this goes fast: especially the Russian part of the Arctic is changing at lightning speed. Ports are being built at a rapid pace and the Russians are building ice breakers in large numbers, so that container ship is able to sail on this new shipping routes in three weeks from China to Norway. \n\nPhotojournalist Yuri Kozyrev visits this fast-changing Russian Part: he sees the gas fields of the Russian gas company Gazprom, which are exploited with the latest techniques and he visits the Marine Academy, where young Russian recruits are trained. The boys, sometimes children, are taught about the climate and the handling of a gun, while they sing about the hero role they will play in the future.\n\nGazprom and the nomadic Nenets, who has been traveling through the polar regions for many years, are on the same ground. But this co-existence seems to be no longer balanced, as the melting North Pole offers economic opportunities but also threatens the lives of the original inhabitants. And the lives of everyone on this planet. What seems far away and out of sight is in fact really essential for mankind, then the North Pole ice functions as a kind of air conditioning for the Earth. Not doing anything is not an option.\n \nWith Kadir van Lohuizen (photojournalist), Yuri Kozyrev (photojournalist) and David Barber (climate scientist).\n\nThis documentary was created by the photographers Kadir Van Lohuizen and Yuri Kozyrev, with support from The Carmignac Foundation.

The transition from petroleum to renewables is in full swing, and global demand for oil could fall faster than predicted. [Online until: April 17, 2019]\n\nWhen the price of crude oil tumbled dramatically between 2014 and 2016, it heralded the demise of an economic and geopolitical world order in place since the end of World War II. In the last few decades, fracking technology has turned the US into the world's largest oil producer.\n\nAgainst that backdrop, the move towards renewable energies and away from fossil resources is making dramatic steps forward. A study published back in September 2012 made headlines by predicting an imminent drop in oil prices. The analysis bucked traditional mainstream scientific opinion, which forecast that the market would continue to climb until hitting \u2018peak oil\u2019 - the moment when global oil production peaked. After that, most experts believed, the price for crude would skyrocket. But by the end of 2013, market supply began to far outstrip demand, and prices collapsed. Within two years, they fell by 70%.

When oil prices rose dramatically in the first decade of the new millennium, companies in the US were able to begin implementing a technology that had previously been viewed as economically unviable - extracting oil and shale gas through fracking. By exploiting its significant shale oil deposits, the US was able to slash imports, which in turn led to an oversupply on world markets and crashing prices. The world\u2019s biggest oil-producing nations began fighting fiercely for their slice of the pie. In a move to break the American producers, Saudi Arabia moved into high-stakes poker mode, flooding the market in an intentional attempt to lower prices even further and force the North American fracking industry to its knees. But the move didn\u2019t pay off, and the order that had prevailed on the international oil market since the end of the Second World War was stood on its head. To turn prices back around, Saudi Arabia and the other members of OPEC were forced to curb production and join forces with Russia. It\u2019s a game with high geopolitical stakes, and the market for oil remains volatile.

The Sea of Asov borders both Ukraine and Russia.  \n\nBoth states have the right to use it. Yet Russia is setting up obstacles to shipping on the sea. What if a situation similar to that in Crimea is threatening this region? Oleksandr Oliynyk, director of the port of Mariupol, is convinced that \u2018Russia wants to destabilize our region and is exerting economic pressure to acquire what it failed to get in 2014.\u2019 The economy of Mariupol has been suffering since the start of the war in Eastern Ukraine. The amount of cargo handled by the port has plummeted. Difficulties for ports in eastern Ukrainian were exacerbated after the opening of the Kerch bridge, connecting the annexed Crimean peninsula with the Russian mainland. Freight ships with a height of more than 33 meters cannot pass under the bridge, and can no longer reach eastern Ukraine. \nRussian border controls and the coastguard body of the FSB, the domestic Russian secret service, make matters worse, costing money and days of waiting for the ship owners. Fewer and fewer shipping firms are willing to call at eastern Ukrainian ports. \u2018Of course we\u2019re worried about losing our jobs\u2019 says Artjom, a docker who has been working a reduced four-day week for some time.

The Sea of Asov borders both Ukraine and Russia.  \n\nBoth states have the right to use it. Yet Russia is setting up obstacles to shipping on the sea. What if a situation similar to that in Crimea is threatening this region? Oleksandr Oliynyk, director of the port of Mariupol, is convinced that \u2018Russia wants to destabilize our region and is exerting economic pressure to acquire what it failed to get in 2014.\u2019 The economy of Mariupol has been suffering since the start of the war in Eastern Ukraine. The amount of cargo handled by the port has plummeted. Difficulties for ports in eastern Ukrainian were exacerbated after the opening of the Kerch bridge, connecting the annexed Crimean peninsula with the Russian mainland. Freight ships with a height of more than 33 meters cannot pass under the bridge, and can no longer reach eastern Ukraine. \nRussian border controls and the coastguard body of the FSB, the domestic Russian secret service, make matters worse, costing money and days of waiting for the ship owners. Fewer and fewer shipping firms are willing to call at eastern Ukrainian ports. \u2018Of course we\u2019re worried about losing our jobs\u2019 says Artjom, a docker who has been working a reduced four-day week for some time. His colleague Sergej, at the neighboring shipyard, has had his hours cut since the beginning of this year. Everyone here is feeling Russia\u2019s increasing pressure and dominance.

The film deals with the controversial history of land in South Africa and views it is a matter that has been distorted for political gain by politicians and land reform activists.

There are so many things that have to be explained about this topic. Aside from the dictionary definition of what \u201csound\u201d is, what really do you know about it? What are the explanations behind it? This article will enlighten you so, continue reading.\n\nAccording to experts, sound is perceived as such because of one primary element \u2013 frequency. Frequency, in the context of sound, is described as the number of waves/wavelengths passing through a fixed place in a particular period of time. It can also be summarized as the \u201cvibration\u201d of an audible element. All forms of sound are measured in terms of frequency. This way sound will be perceived is dependent on the way its frequency demonstrates. The sound of a typical ringing phone will sound differently if its frequency or the vibration will be modified.\n\nWithout this basic component, it is impossible for an element to be audible. The effect of sound is further sub-divided on to three different elements. These include \u2018binaural beats\u2019, synesthesia, and cymatics. These three combined creates a particular macro-element called sound, which in turn affects a listener or other phenomena.\n\nBinaural beat \u2013 this is a form of auditory illusion that the brain perceives when two distinctive pure-tone waves in a given time and space are presented into the ears. There are several processes occurring that lead to the perception of this audible component. These include the passing of sound waves through the ear to certain parts of the brain resulting in precipitation of electrical impulses along the neural pathways and other cerebral regions.\n\nSynesthesia \u2013 is a phenomenon in which two or more body senses perceive a particular element. It can be existent on some other elements but in the case of sound, synesthesia happens when the sense of hearing simultaneously works with the sense of sight and touch for example to perceive sound. In other words, this is a combined perception. This is sometimes the reason why some people tend to have a greater appreciation of sound. Their multiple sensations of it make them possible to wander into new and unique paradigms sound has to offer.\n\nCymatics \u2013 this refers to the wave subset of vibrations that forms a phenomenon. To make it clearer, the effect of sound waves on an individual\u2019s conscious mind is rooted to cymatics. The formation of vibrations can influence the neurological state of a person. This is the reason why certain kinds of sound can cause relaxation or anxiety to a listener.\n\nOver the years, humans have learned how to manipulate, appreciate, and respond to different forms of sound. Now, the way sound is being perceived, utilized, and valued has gone farther than one could ever imagine. All these can never be possible without the gradual disclosure of the secrets and science of sound.\n\nhttps://www.derekstholmes.com/frequency-the-secrets-science-of-sound/", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/w2x2JrHYQu4/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/w2x2JrHYQu4/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/w2x2JrHYQu4/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}, "standard": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/w2x2JrHYQu4/sddefault.jpg", "width": 640, "height": 480}, "maxres": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/w2x2JrHYQu4/maxresdefault.jpg", "width": 1280, "height": 720}}, "channelTitle": "G Codex", "tags": ["Documentary", "Frequency", "Energy", "Vibrations", "New Age", "Science", "Sound", "Cymatics", "Universe", "Laws", "Physics", "Physical", "Matter", "Material", "Interesting", "Waves", "Wavelengths", "binaural beats", "synesthesia", "Masaru Emoto", "Experiment", "Spirit Science", "Spirituality", "Secrets of Universe", "How sound affects", "Humans", "Animals", "Nature", "Emotions", "Patterns", "What is", "How does sound work", "Hearing", "Neuroscience", "Music", "2014", "2019", "NASA", "Science of Sound", "G Codex"], "categoryId": "28", "liveBroadcastContent": "none", "localized": {"title": "Frequency | The Secret Science of Sound", "description": "2014 Documentary\n\nThe Invisible Universe\n\nWhat would the world be without sound?

To make it clearer, the effect of sound waves on an individual\u2019s conscious mind is rooted to cymatics. The formation of vibrations can influence the neurological state of a person. This is the reason why certain kinds of sound can cause relaxation or anxiety to a listener.\n\nOver the years, humans have learned how to manipulate, appreciate, and respond to different forms of sound. Now, the way sound is being perceived, utilized, and valued has gone farther than one could ever imagine. All these can never be possible without the gradual disclosure of the secrets and science of sound.\n\nhttps://www.derekstholmes.com/frequency-the-secrets-science-of-sound/"}, "defaultAudioLanguage": "en-GB"}, "contentDetails": {"duration": "PT58M23S", "dimension": "2d", "definition": "hd", "caption": "false", "licensedContent": false, "projection": "rectangular"}, "statistics": {"viewCount": "392", "likeCount": "3", "dislikeCount": "0", "favoriteCount": "0", "commentCount": "0"}}, {"kind": "youtube#video", "etag": "\"XpPGQXPnxQJhLgs6enD_n8JR4Qk/RnLJdE9eQGTJrIY4jTp8Plbc4Dk\"", "id": "8GSpiDvZTho", "snippet": {"channelId": "UCBR8-60-B28hp2BmDPdntcQ", "title": "Deleted video", "description": "This video is unavailable.", "channelTitle": "YouTube"}}, {"kind": "youtube#video", "etag": "\"XpPGQXPnxQJhLgs6enD_n8JR4Qk/OopEYFWAw-WoBYziZyW4N200F90\"", "id": "pk1WXwPJzwg", "snippet": {"publishedAt": "2014-06-09T18:11:56.000Z", "channelId": "UCNye-wNBqNL5ZzHSJj3l8Bg", "title": "\ud83c\uddea\ud83c\uddec Egypt's Lost Power | Al Jazeera Investigations", "description": "Clayton Swisher from Al Jazeera's Investigative Unit explores the corrupt deals that plunged Egypt into an energy crisis and now leave it facing dependency on Israel. \n\n\nSubscribe to our channel  http://bit.ly/AJSubscribe\nFollow us on Twitter https://twitter.com/AJEnglish\nFind us on Facebook https://www.facebook.com/aljazeera\nCheck our website:  http://www.aljazeera.com/\n\n#AlJazeeraEnglish #Egypt #AlJazeeraInvestigations", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/pk1WXwPJzwg/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/pk1WXwPJzwg/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/pk1WXwPJzwg/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}, "standard": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/pk1WXwPJzwg/sddefault.jpg", "width": 640, "height": 480}, "maxres": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/pk1WXwPJzwg/maxresdefault.jpg", "width": 1280, "height": 720}}, "channelTitle": "Al Jazeera English", "tags": ["Al jazeera", "news", "sisi", "natural gas", "israel", "sinai", "gaza", "tel aviv", "Hussein Salem", "egypt election", "Al Jazeera Investigative Unit", "East Mediterranean Gas", "corruption", "Hosni Mubarak", "Yossi Maiman", "Noble Energy", "Union Fenosa", "Israeli Electric Company", "EgyptsLostPower", "Shabtai Shavit", "Mossad", "egypts sexual assault", "sexual assault", "tahrir harassment", "harassment", "full documentary", "documentary 2014", "history documentary", "war documentary", "Clayton Swisher", "\ud83c\uddea\ud83c\uddec"], "categoryId": "25", "liveBroadcastContent": "none", "defaultLanguage": "en", "localized": {"title": "\ud83c\uddea\ud83c\uddec Egypt's Lost Power | Al Jazeera Investigations", "description": "Clayton Swisher from Al Jazeera's Investigative Unit explores the corrupt deals that plunged Egypt into an energy crisis and now leave it facing dependency on Israel. \n\n\nSubscribe to our channel  http://bit.ly/AJSubscribe\nFollow us on Twitter https://twitter.com/AJEnglish\nFind us on Facebook https://www.facebook.com/aljazeera\nCheck our website:  http://www.aljazeera.com/\n\n#AlJazeeraEnglish #Egypt #AlJazeeraInvestigations"}, "defaultAudioLanguage": "en"}, "contentDetails": {"duration": "PT47M47S", "dimension": "2d", "definition": "hd", "caption": "false", "licensedContent": true, "projection": "rectangular"}, "statistics": {"viewCount": "192516", "likeCount": "809", "dislikeCount": "93", "favoriteCount": "0", "commentCount": "238"}}, {"kind": "youtube#video", "etag": "\"XpPGQXPnxQJhLgs6enD_n8JR4Qk/TGP-ien3KYUjoI-7lH5SnVL5gSI\"", "id": "tt2AYafET68", "snippet": {"publishedAt": "2013-04-09T20:09:54.000Z", "channelId": "UCn8zNIfYAQNdrFRrr8oibKw", "title": "Surviving in the Siberian Wilderness for 70 Years (Full Length)", "description": "In 1936, a family of Russian Old Believers journeyed deep into Siberia's vast taiga to escape persecution and protect their way of life.
